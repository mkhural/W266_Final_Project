257764,True,545,"Researchers over at Check Point Security have discovered a severe infection in 38 Android devices which came pre-installed, belonging to a large telecommunications company, as well as a multinational technology firm.

According to the security firm, the malware arrived before users turned on their handsets for the first time. ""The malicious apps were not part of the official ROM supplied by the vendor, and were added somewhere along the supply chain,"" the report stated. It affected many devices from various brands, which include the following:

Samsung Galaxy Note2

LG G4

Samsung Galaxy S7

Samsung Galaxy S4

Samsung Galaxy Note4

Samsung Galaxy Note5

Xiaomi Mi 4i

Xiaomi Redmi

ZTE X500

Samsung Galaxy Note3

Samsung Galaxy Note Edge

Samsung Galaxy Tab S2

Samsung Galaxy A5

Vivo X6 Plus

Asus Zenfone 2

Lenovo S90

Oppo R7 Plus

Oppo N3

Lenovo A850

Most of the malware found pre-installed on affected devices were information stealers and rough ad networks, which included a ransomware called Slocker. This crypto-malware uses AES encryption algorithm to lock a victim's files, and then demands money in exchange of unlocking them.

Check Point notes that the most notable rough adnet to target the devices is the Loki malware. ""The malware displays illegitimate advertisements to generate revenue,"" says the security firm. ""As part of its operation, the malware steals data about the device and installs itself to system, allowing it to take full control of the device and achieve persistency.""

While it is of course advised to be wary of where we download our apps, it is noted that pre-installed malware is a completely different problem to tackle. Check Point expounds further:

Pre-installed malware compromise the security even of the most careful users. In addition, a user who receives a device already containing malware will not be able to notice any change in the device's activity which often occur once a malware is installed. The discovery of the pre-installed malware raises some alarming issues regarding mobile security. Users could receive devices which contain backdoors or are rooted without their knowledge.

Those who are interested in knowing more regarding the malware and the affected devices can check out the source link. Also, it is advised to utilize advanced security software which is capable of detecting and blocking malicious software, like Lookout or Malwarebytes Anti-Malware, which can help prevent malicious attacks in the long run.

259767,False,1024,"Glass et al. (1989) reported a 16-year-old boy with severe mental retardation, microcephaly, and craniofacial dysmorphism associated with an interstitial deletion of chromosome 2q32.2-q33.1. He had no comprehensible speech and was totally dependent for all activities. Facial features included large beaked nose, ptosis, and cleft palate. He also had seizures and a striking scalloped skin pigmentation that did not follow Blaschko lines. Activity of isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH1; 147700) was normal.

Van Buggenhout et al. (2005) reported 4 unrelated patients with interstitial deletions of chromosome 2q32-q33. Common clinical features included pre- and postnatal growth retardation, severe mental retardation, thin and sparse hair, persistent feeding difficulties, inguinal hernia, and broad-based gait. Facial features included high long face, high forehead, ptosis, dacrocystitis, high nasal bridge, small mouth, teeth abnormalities, micrognathia, and cleft or high-arched palate. Two patients had seizures, and 3 had spasticity and contractures. Three patients had a specific behavioral phenotype with hyperactivity and motor restlessness, chaotic behavior, and happy personality intermixed with periods of aggression and anxiety, sleeping problems and self-mutilation. Array CGH and FISH analysis showed that all patients shared an 8.1-Mb minimal deleted region. The cleft or high-arched palate most likely resulted from hemizygosity for the SATB2 gene (608148).

Rosenfeld et al. (2009) reported 3 unrelated patients with small heterozygous deletions of chromosome 2q33.1, ranging from 173.1 to 185.2 kb, that affected only the SATB2 gene. Parental samples from the mother were available for only 2 patients, and neither mother carried the deletion; parental samples were not available for the third patient. All patients had severe developmental delay, mental retardation, and tooth anomalies, but other features varied. Dentofacial anomalies included delayed primary dentition and micrognathia in 1 patient; cleft palate, crowded teeth, and small mandible in the second; and fused mandibular central incisors without cleft palate in the third. Two patients had behavioral abnormalities and mild dysmorphic features. Rosenfeld et al. (2009) concluded that haploinsufficiency for SATB2 is responsible for some of the clinical features associated with the 2q32-q33 deletion syndrome.

Urquhart et al. (2009) reported a girl with a de novo heterozygous 4.5-Mb microdeletion of chromosome 2q33.1. She had cleft soft palate, feeding problems, febrile seizures, and delayed psychomotor development with poor speech. She was mildly dysmorphic, with broad forehead, flat philtrum, small mouth, thin upper lip, missing lateral incisors, and relative macrocephaly, but ears were normal. She also had joint laxity, valgus foot deformity, broad toes and thumbs, brachydactyly, and contractures of the fourth and fifth fingers. She had a social disposition. Brain MRI showed nonspecific periventricular white matter abnormalities. The deleted region included the SATB2 gene.

Rifai et al. (2010) reported a 16-year-old girl, born of unrelated French Caribbean parents, with an interstitial 26.3-Mb deletion of chromosome 2q31.2-q33.2. She had prenatal and postnatal growth retardation, microcephaly, facial dysmorphism, cleft palate, camptodactyly, bilateral talipes equinovarus, severe intellectual disability, and ectodermal anomalies. Ectodermal anomalies included thin, atrophic skin, sparse, brittle, slowly growing hair, oligodontia with abnormally shaped teeth, normal sweating, and normal fingernails. These findings were consistent with a diagnosis of ectodermal dysplasia. The deletion resulted in hemizygosity for the HOXD gene (see, e.g., HOXD1; 142987) cluster and its regulatory elements, which may affect limb development. Haploinsufficiency of other genes such as COL3A1 (120180)/COL5A2 (120190), GTF3C3 (604888), CASP8 (601763), CASP10 (601762), and SATB2 may also influence the phenotype.

Balasubramanian et al. (2011) reported 7 unrelated patients with different interstitial deletions of chromosome 2q33.1. The phenotype was variable, but common features included delayed psych",0.0,0.7774110613390803,-1.6,0.0

257701,True,816,"Broncos head coach Vance Joseph has a clear plan in place for how he intends to use his quarterbacks and starters in Thursday's preseason opener at Chicago.

The starting defense, including pass rusher Von Miller, will play a maximum of three series to begin the game.

""It depends on how it goes,"" Joseph said. ""If they go out there and play a dominant series, they may play one. If they have a so-so series in the first and a better series in the second series, they'll only play two. But three max.""

On offense, Trevor Siemian was named the starting quarterback vs. the Bears; Paxton Lynch was named the starter for the second preseason game against San Francisco. Each quarterback, Joseph said, will play about a quarter and a half.

Starting running back C.J. Anderson will follow the script of the defense and play a maximum of three series. Veteran Stevan Ridley, rookie De'Angelo Henderson and Juwan Thompson will finish out the game. Veteran Jamaal Charles, who took more reps in practice Tuesday as the team moved back outside, will not play in Chicago.

""We want to stay with the plan for Jamaal and just give him more and more reps as we go along,"" Joseph said. ""Being inside (Monday), we didn't want him on the turf that much with his history. Back on the grass, we gave him more reps.""

The starting offensive line Thursday will consist of Garett Bolles at left tackle, Max Garcia at left guard, Connor McGovern at center, Ron Leary at right guard and Menelik Watson at right tackle. Matt Paradis, still easing his way back from two hip surgeries earlier this year, will not play.

Injury updates

Joseph said inside linebacker Todd Davis will not play in Thursday's preseason game because of the shoulder sprain that has kept him out of practices. Davis did not workout with the team Tuesday morning and Joseph said his availability in preseason could be limited because of the injury.

""His timeline, it's day-to-day,"" Joseph said. ""It's more precautionary for Todd than a concern.""

Corey Nelson will start with Davis sidelined.

""Corey is on the lines of (cornerback Bradley) Roby,"" Joseph said. ""He's our third inside linebacker, our starting dime player. So, in my opinion, Corey is a starter. On most teams, Corey would be a starter. If he had to play for us, I would have no problem with Corey being the (regular-season) starter for us.""

As for other injured or recovering players, running back Bernard Pierce (hamstring) did not practice Tuesday and safety T.J. Ward (hamstring) observed from the sideline. Joseph said Monday that Ward will not play Thursday.

Emergency plan

The Broncos opened Tuesday's practice by working on their contingency plans on special teams.

Defensive end Billy Winn stepped in as the emergency long snapper, Siemian took over for Riley Dixon as the emergency holder, and then Dixon dropped back as kicker. On punts, kicker Brandon McManus filled the emergency slot. McManus served as placekicker and punter and handled kickoffs while in college at Temple.

Footnotes

According to ESPN, quarterback Mike Glennon is expected to start Thursday's game in Chicago and will likely play a series or two. Mark Sanchez, a familiar face in Denver after last year's quarterback competition, and rookie Mitchell Trubisky will play the remainder of the game. … Special teams coordinator Brock Olivo was asked if Miller could seriously return punts. ""We could probably put Von back there alone,"" he said jokingly. ""I don't think there's anything Von Miller can't do. He's a great dancer, too."" … Joseph said offensive coordinator Mike McCoy and defensive coordinator Joe Woods will wear headsets on the sideline.",0.0,0.7181717222112984,-1.0,-0.1
256179,True,835,"If I had a dime for every time I've seen or heard a Jazz fan complain about the Jazz passing on Paul George in the 2010 draft, I would be able to pay for a lower bowl seat to a Jazz game. I think the clamor from Jazz fans has been for a few reasons:

1. It's easy to love a player that you only see highlights of and harder to love your own player who you watch 3 times a week, warts and all.

2. Paul George was just named to the All-Star team. I mean, he's an All-star. Hayward is a 6th man.

3. Gordon Hayward can't do this:


I am the president of the ""circumstance over talent"" club, which is a club I just made up comprised of NBA fans who see the difference between a player who is truly better at basketball and a player who just has a better opportunity to put up numbers or succeed. And with Gordon Hayward and Paul George, I think most Jazz fans believe George is a little or much better than Hayward, but I am not so convinced.

Before I show you some numbers, i must explain that I am not a huge fan of the way Per-36 minutes numbers are often used. If you are using them to show why a guy who plays 12 minutes and scores 8 points would average 24 points if given 36 minutes, that is probably a misuse of the stat. But if you are trying to standardize stats for two different players who play different amounts of minutes, but both play close to 36 minutes against top competition for most of the game, I think it's a useful tool. With that in mind, here are the Per 36 minute numbers for Hayward and George.

Which player is better? The top player is a significantly better rebounder and slightly better assist getter. But the bottom player is better in almost every other category. More points, less turnovers, better shooting from the field, the 3 point line and the free throw line. And the bottom player gets to the free throw line at a much better rate. The bottom player is Gordon Hayward and the top player is Paul George. To me, the big difference is that George is a much better rebounder and plays 11 more minutes per game. Other than that, Hayward is better at almost everything.

Paul George

Gordon Hayward

There are a couple things I think are important to this data. First, look at how Hayward's usage percentage has steadily climbed during his career. Part of this is due to is coming off the bench, but he actually has the ball in his hands as much as Paul George does, almost to the decimal point. And the fact that Hayward has increased his usage by a large amount, AND has cut his turnovers down, is super encouraging.

Secondly, I think every Jazz fan has lamented Hayward's turnover problems, but he actually turns the ball at a lower rate than George does. In fact if you look at synergy, which is a pretty good way to document the way a player uses offensive possessions, you will see that Hayward is really George's equal.

Hayward averages 0.94 points per possession to George's 0.9. George is a slightly better isolation scorer, but when both are put in pick n roll situations, George turns the ball over 22.5% of the time to Hayward's 24% of the time. So while there is a ton of room for improvement for Hayward on pick n rolls, he isn't lagging far behind George, although both are significantly behind contemporaries like John Wall, Evan Turner or even Kyrie Irving, players who use up to 30% of their possessions in pick n roll situations, while keeping their turnover percentages down around 17%. But Turner has several of his own limitations and Irving might be the best player in the NBA in 6 years.

So the next time you hear a Jazz fan lament at the fact that the Jazz drafted Gordon Hayward instead of Paul George, just tell them that Hayward is as productive as George is, if not even more.",0.0,0.7046107602689196,-3.1,0.0

Although these facts do not change the effectiveness of the uses of Approaches (your approach level and stunts impact that), the scope of what you can do is largely impacted by your Aspects, as defined by power facts. Let's look at Miss Martian , whose character sheet appears in the link.
Her power facts state that as a Martian she has the following abilities: Shape-shifting: She can change her form, completely altering her physical appearance, including her organic clothing, allowing her to mimic other people as well as adapt to different environments. Malleability: She can extend her limbs into large whips to grab things at great distance. Healing: Her shape-shifting allows her to heal faster than a human would.  Camouflage: She can change the appearance of her form (and her clothes) to match her surroundings, but she is not completely invisible. Super strength: Like all Martians, Miss Martian has strength above that of a typical human. Telepathy: Telepathy comes naturally to Martians. She can create a telepathic link with her teammates, which makes communications easier and untraceable. Megan can also telepathically connect with her Bio-Ship. Multilingualism: Megan can speak Martian and English. She can also translate languages psychically.  Telekinesis: Megan can use telekinesis to manipulate many objects with her mind. However, she can lose control when moving too many objects at once or not paying enough attention. By telekinetically moving herself, she can simulate flight.  Heat/Fire Sensitive: Miss Martian can be weakened when exposed to direct heat or fire This is, to be fair, an overwhelmingly MASSIVE list of abilities, all granted by a single aspect. Surely this is broken character compared to someone like Robin who is limited to what his wits and agility alone allows him? Yes....and no. As noted above she is still limited in the use of all of these abilities by the strength of her approaches and stunts, just like any other character. This is the beauty of Fate in many ways: even with all of these vast powers she is ultimately using the same four actions available to anyone else, and is no stronger in general at them than anyone else. It's just the permissions of what these actions can mean narratively is expanded by her powers. When we get to making characters in our game, the following questions should be addressed: What can your powers do? How do they work and/or why can you do these things? What limits can be compelled on them? As long as the three questions above can be answered, you have created a great set of powers for the game. :-) *** Next up: Approaches vs Skills in Fate .

256185,True,1000,"If they plan on passing an online poker bill in 2014 the California legislature had better get a move on. The clock is ticking down on this legislative session, with just about two weeks remaining before the final buzzer sounds, and online poker has gone from a long-shot to a pipe dream.

Outside forces are certainly trying to get the legislature to act, from the 13 tribe coalition pushing their own bill to a group of 25 card rooms who recently sent a letter to two key individuals in the statehouse, Senator Lou Correa and Assemblyman Reginald Jones-Sawyer. And how can we forget the efforts of the Santa Ysabel tribe who are threatening to launch their own online poker website without the state's permission.

With so many possible scenarios capable of being played out over the next couple of weeks let's take a look at what will happen under the most likely scenario, which is the legislature not acting —The senate bill has already been pulled off the table according to the LA Times and the Assembly bill starting to look like a lost cause as well— and what that will lead to in California.

If the legislature punts

If the legislature does not act on online poker in the coming weeks we will learn one thing for certain; whether or not the Santa Ysabel tribe's threats to launch are real or if the tribe was bluffing to try and get a favorable bill passed.

My position all along has been that the Santa Ysabel threat was little more than a bluff designed to either get the legislature to act, and even more likely to make sure that some sort of revenue sharing bill was discussed with smaller tribes unable to pay the stiff licensing fees and compete with the larger tribes and card rooms.

Santa Ysabel has stuck with the story that they are serious about launching, and if the legislature does punt they very well might.

While I don't think their intention was to test the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act and the definition of Class II gaming, they do have all the pieces in place to do so, including a software provider, a seemingly willing payment processor, and a regulatory agency housing their servers in Canada.

Frankly, the Santa Ysabel tribe has little to lose (the tribe is already in severe debt from its failed foray into brick & mortar gambling) but they could alter online poker in the US, and not necessarily for the better.

The effect on partnerships

We will also see what becomes of the partnerships and coalitions that have formed this year.

What becomes of PokerStars tentative partnership with the Morongo Band of Mission Indians, the Bicycle Casino, the Commerce Casino, and Hawaiian Gardens? What about the coalition of 13 tribes? Or the card rooms?

Some of the partnerships were simply ""the enemy of my enemy is my friend"" relationships and others were tenuous at best. Given a few months to reset and rethink their positions it's highly unlikely that these same partnerships will remain when the issue is taken up in the next legislative session.

This is especially applicable if (as I'll soon explain) the threat of a Bad Actor clause is off the table.

If there is suddenly zero chance that a Bad Actor clause will be included in an online poker bill introduced down the road I would expect the Morongo group and the coalition of 13 tribes and the 25 card rooms to suddenly see their interests aligned, but rifts could form over other policy disagreements, such as revenue sharing and even race tracks.

Bad Actor clause will likely be off the table

Remarkably, if the legislature is unable to get an online poker bill passed it will likely lead to the possibility of a Bad Actor clause being included next year somewhere in the 0.0 range.

The reason I say this is that PokerStars is expected to be licensed in New Jersey in the very near future, and it would be very difficult for any future state to pass a bill with a Bad Actor clause that would cover companies licensed in other states.

It's not impossible, but considering the legal fights that have already been suggested in California over the Bad Actor clause it seems highly unlikely that Bad Actor language would be applied if the company(s) in question are licensed in New Jersey.

There is also the not so small issue of Amaya Gaming suddenly falling into the Bad Actor category due to its ownership of PokerStars and Full Tilt Poker –virtually every casino/online casino uses Amaya licensed games.

Many pundits feel that certain tribes resolve against a Bad Actor clause was a stalling tactic to insure a bill was not passed — they essentially feigned a desire for online poker when they are actually against it but made sure the wedge issue was not resolved and killed the bill.

If this is the case then this will have backfired, as it only slightly delayed the inevitable and further aligned the many divergent interests in the state.",0.0,0.6943156539526087,-1.2000000000000002,0.0

THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED. DARYN KAGAN, CNN ANCHOR: As promised, we go live to Washington, D.C. and the White House. Here is President Clinton. (JOINED IN PROGRESS) WILLIAM J. CLINTON, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: ... and the poverty rate has fallen to its lowest level in 20 years. Today there's more good economic news. Eight years ago, our future was at risk. Economic growth was low, unemployment was high, interest rates were high, the federal debt had quadrupled in the previous 12 years. When Vice President Gore and I took office, the budget deficit was $290 billion, and it was projected this year the budget deficit would be $455 billion. The American people, thankfully, chose a better future. They put their support behind a new economic direction of fiscal discipline, greater investment in our people, expanded trade in our products. It's given us the longest economic expansion in history and the strongest fiscal turnaround in memory. Record budget deficits have given way to record surpluses. And this has enabled us to do something that would have been impossible just eight years ago -- we've actually begun to pay down the debt. Today we received more good news that our strategy is working. According to the Office of Management and Budget, this year's budget surplus will be at least $230 billion. With this surplus, we've been able to cut the debt over the last three years by this figure -- (writes the number on a chart) -- $360 billion in debt reduction over the last three years. This year alone we've cut the debt by at least $223 billion, the largest one-year debt reduction in the history of the United States. Like our Olympic athletes in Sydney, the American people are breaking all kinds of records these days. This is the first year we've balanced the budget without using the Medicare trust fund since Medicare was created in 1965. I think we should follow Al Gore's advice and lock those trust funds away for the future. We've come a long way since then, and a long way since 1993. But we can go further still. If we stay on the path we're on, we can pay this debt off entirely by 2012, for the first time since Andrew Jackson was President, in 1835. Paying off the debt will benefit America, just as paying off credit cards benefits the average family. It frees up money for the things that matter, and it keeps interest rates lower. That will mean more investment, more jobs, lower mortgage payments, car payments, and student loan payments. This is all terribly important. Already the benefits of debt reduction have meant about $2,000 a year -- or deficit reduction, and then debt reduction -- has been about $2,000 a year in lower interest payments for home mortgages, about $200 a year in lower interest payments for cars, about $200 a year for lower interest payments on college loans. And if we stay on this path, rather than go back and spend all the surplus and get back into the Social Security funds, it will keep interest rates about a point lower over the next decade. That will be worth in home mortgages alone over $300 billion. So this is a very important thing to do. And I hope that we will see a continuation of this trend in this year's final end-game budget negotiations. However, the fiscal year is almost over and Congress still has sent me only two of the 13 spending bills. We need to put our priorities in order and put the broad national interest above special interest. The key to fiscal discipline, to these kinds of results, is maintaining it each year, year after year. If you look at what's happened in the last eight years, federal spending today as a percentage of the economy is the lowest it has been since 1966. The federal civilian work force is the smallest it's been since 1960, down 377,000 from the day I took office. I am concerned, frankly, about the size and last-minute nature of this year's congressional spending spree, where they seem to be loading up the spending bills with special projects for special interests, but can't seem to find the time to raise the minimum wage, or pass a patients' bill of rights, or drug benefits for our seniors through Medicare, or tax cuts for long-term care, child care, or college education. And first and foremost, they haven't found the funds for education, for continuing to hire 100,000 qualified teachers to reduce class size, to build and modernize schools, to provide after-school for children who need it, and have real accountability for failing schools, requiring them to turn around or shut down or be put under new management.

INDIANAPOLIS, Ind. (October 13, 2015) - A gas station clerk was shot over an order of nachos, police say. Officials and family members identified the victim as Kyle Frye, 24.

Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department (IMPD) officers were dispatched to the Speedway gas station at 71st Street and Keystone Avenue around 1:15 a.m. on a report of a robbery. When they arrived on scene, they found Frye shot in the face and abdomen.

Witnesses say the suspect went into the gas station shortly after 1 a.m. and asked the clerk about nachos. The suspect exchanged a few words with the clerk before leaving. He then returned moments later, pulled out a gun and shot the clerk twice.

The suspect, Terrance Harris, 26, didn't want cash but he did take off with the nachos.

Police say Frye was able to walk to the front door and locked it until police arrived. Officers found the victim lying on the floor of the gas station.

EMS crews transported the victim to St. Vincent Hospital.

Surveillance cameras from the gas station captured clear images of Harris during the shooting. He was later taking into custody for questioning and then arrested. Harris faces preliminary charges of attempted murder and robbery.

At this point, investigators believe the shooting was random.

""In this case it's really hard to comprehend that someone walks right up to a clerk and raises their gun at someone and just shoots them,"" said IMPD officer Rafael Diaz.

Frye's family told FOX59 he had just transferred to the north side Speedway a couple months ago. He was working the late shift on his birthday.

""He is truly a good brother, friend, son, uncle and human being. I don't know why this senseless act of violence befell him. Thoughts and prayers are much appreciated and needed,"" a family member said.

The current belief is a fairly mild sprain to the ankle, and the Herald's Jeff Howe made it clear that it isdefinitely an ankle injury and not an Achilles issue, which means that he shouldn't miss much time, if any at all.

While it would be nice for the full defense to be on the field at any given week, it seems like McCourty should be okay and any injury shouldn't be lasting.

In other injury updates, linebacker Jonathan Freeny was seen with a cast after the game. Jerod Mayo took his role in the lineup and unsurprisingly outplayed him for yet another week. Hopefully Freeny won't miss any time, though, because he's an excellent special teams player.

Defensive tackle Dominique Easley drew attention for his injury, but he remained on the sideline and worked out on an exercise bike. It's very rare for a player to have a serious injury and to continue to remain on the field, so it's likely a minor issue that won't hold him out for much time. Since he was on a bike, it was likely trying to work out some tightness in his quad, which aligns will his leg giving out on the play.

Easley is clearly concerned about his knees and his reaction was extremely similar to Rob Gronkowski against the Broncos- anything that might be scary gets magnified a trillion times due to the history.

256865,False,1024,"Remarks prepared for ""Fighting Inequality: Leveraging Opportunities for Innovation,"" Project on Municipal Innovation, September 24, Harvard Kennedy School.

I told a colleague I was going to give a talk about inequality, but that I had to do it over dessert, and I wasn't sure how that was going to go over. She said, ""It's perfect … let them eat cake.""

Ben and Steven and the good folks at Living Cities invited me here tonight because inequality is a key theme of your gathering over the next day.

And inequality, particularly in big cities, is something that's been a bigger part of the national dialogue over the past few years, probably starting with Occupy Wall Street in 2011.

Soon thereafter in 2013, there were a series of elections across many of your cities where the issue of inequality, and what mayors should do about it, was a big part of the debate. New York, Minneapolis, Boston, Seattle, Los Angeles, and others.

This was no straw man issue. Inequality is indeed high and rising in many American cities.

San Francisco seems to be the quintessential example, and with good reason. The Chronicle ran a piece a couple weeks back entitled, ""San Francisco's strange detour from paradise to parody."" It quoted a longtime resident of the Mission District, ground zero for the city's gentrification:

""I live one block away from Valencia Street, where there's a new restaurant that opens up every 15 minutes. How many chocolate shops does Valencia need?""

About a one-bedroom apartment in the Mission advertised for $6,800/month: ""I did the math: $80,000 for rent for a year? You could buy three houses in Buffalo.""

But these absurd stories and my previous work on inequality weren't really the impetus for my talk, or for the conversations you'll have tomorrow.

Rather, I think what drove this focus was the events that unfolded in Baltimore back in April and May, which came in close proximity to others in Ferguson, Mo.; in Staten Island, N.Y.; in North Charleston, S.C.

The obvious common thread was the tragic death of an African American male at the hands of police … and the tensions they exposed between minority communities and law enforcement, bred in part by a long history of misguided criminal justice practices and policies.

You can see this tension in the words of West Baltimore residents quoted in the Baltimore Sun during the days of the unrest. Here are a few:

– Resa Burton, a lifelong West Baltimore resident: ""They killed a man, but it could've been me! It could've been me! It could been my brother, my nephew! It could've been you!"" – Vaughn DeVaughn, a city teacher: ""This is about anger and frustration and them not knowing how to express it."" Author Alan Berube Senior Fellow and Deputy Director - Metropolitan Policy Program – Sandra Almond-Cooper, president of the Mondawmin Neighborhood Improvement Association: ""These kids are just angry,"" Almond-Cooper said. ""These are the same kids they [meaning the police] pull up on the corner for no reason.""

These are the very real, very raw surface issues that Freddie Gray's death—and Michael Brown's, and Eric Garner's, and Walter Scott's—exposed.

Several weeks after the unrest, a video team from Brookings went to West Baltimore, and talked to a number of young people. I highly recommend the video, you can Google ""Brookings Baltimore"" to find it. Here were some of the quotes from the young people in that video:

""Within my community, everything is divided. You have one community, and you cross the street, into a complete other community where the poverty, and the neighborhood, and the people are completely different, even though we're just five minutes away."" ""Where I live, you've got houses that are boarded up, and have trash."" ""Everything is still segregated, opportunities are different, kids aren't allowed to go to certain schools, if they do, they won't feel comfortable, they'll feel like outcasts in those schools."" ""Educational opportunities in my neighborhood are poor.""

It was those underlying issues, issues that lie at the confluence of race, place, and opportunity in America, that motivated a colleague and I (a Baltimore resident) to write a piece in the wake of the unrest.

We called it, ""Good fortune, dire poverty, and inequality in Baltimore: An American story."" The title was more about the art of search engine optimization than anything else.

But we wrote it in part as a response to the emerging narratives in the media about the deeper structural issues in Baltimore that fueled the unrest. Narratives like:

– Baltimore is ""The Wire."" It's ""Homicide: Life on the Street."" It's a dangerous city overrun by crime and the drug trade. Or",0.4417055285074103,0.7417055285074103,-0.30000000000000004,0.0

The landmark new study conducted by BDS Analytics, entitled ""Cannabis Consumers are Happy Campers,"" surveyed 2,000 California and Colorado adults, with a quota of 1,200 people who have used marijuana within the past six months.

The logic was to gather info from a population sample that was representative of the general public.

Their subjects, according to BDS's research division page, were comprised of ""consumers"" to ""acceptors,"" who don't consume but might consider it, as well as ""rejecters"" who don't consume and don't want to.

""One theme that clearly emerges from the research is the overall healthy well-being of cannabis consumers… when compared to 'acceptors' and 'rejecters,'"" the report reads, breaking down the myth of cannabis consumers and work ethic.

Researchers found that the average annual household income among California cannabis consumers is $93,800, compared to $72,800 for 'acceptors' and $75,900 for 'rejecters.'

Twenty percent of cannabis consumers also hold master's degrees, compared to 13 percent of 'acceptors' and 12 percent of 'rejecters.'

Colorado consumers were more satisfied with their lives now than they were a year ago and more likely to enjoy the fine arts, social activities and outdoor recreation than the acceptors and rejecters.

Sixty-four percent of Colorado consumers enjoyed being employed full-time, with just over 51 percent of acceptors and 54 percent of rejecters.

""Cannabis consumers are far removed from the caricatures historically used to describe them,"" said Linda Gilbert, head of the consumer research division at BDS Analytics. ""In fact, positive lifestyle indicators like volunteering, socializing, satisfaction with life and enjoyment of exercise and the outdoors are highest among cannabis consumers, at least in Colorado and California.""

The study will be updated every six months indefinitely. BDS will do its next research on this topic in Washington and Oregon.

""The aim is that this will eventually be a national study,"" Gilbert said. ""I hope and expect that 10 to 20 years from now, this study will still be continuing.""

""The thing everyone agrees on,"" Gilbert continued, ""is that cannabis can impair your ability to drive, and that we need tests to determine if you are driving under the influence.""

258670,True,668,"An Alberta school funded fully by taxpayers and answerable to a public board requires teachers to abstain from ""homosexual relations"" and warns students that the unjust risk everlasting torment in the ""lake of fire.""

An opposition critic expressed shock Sunday that the Conservative government recently committed to spending $7 million to modernize and expand Prairie Christian Academy (PCA), despite the fact the Three Hills facility displays policies on its website that ""fly in the face"" of both the province's human rights legislation and the country's Constitution.

""Fifteen years after the Supreme Court outlawed discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation, it is unbelievable this is still happening,"" Liberal MLA Kent Hehr said.

""I am starting to question what oversight Minister Jeff Johnson and his education department are providing to the system.""

A private religious school founded more than seven decades ago, Prairie Christian Academy joined the Golden Hills School Division in 2003, a decision the school's website says allowed it to get increased public funding.

While parents still pay nominal fees for religious education, the regular program of study, busing and even lease and utility costs are fully covered by the local board.

The K-12 school, located about 130 kilometres northeast of Calgary, is one of several dozen faith-based facilities that have become part of the public system since the province amended the School Act in 1988 to make the moves possible.

A concluding paragraph in PCA's statement of faith, which all students in Grades 7 through 12 are required to sign, says the unjust will go to Hell and be subject to ""everlasting punishment of conscious torment in the lake of fire.""

The reference from the Book of Revelation entered popular political parlance in Alberta during the 2012 provincial election.

Wildrose leader Danielle Smith faced heavy criticism at the time when she refused to dump candidate Allen Hunsperger for his use of the term in a blog post critical of new policies at some school boards aimed at protecting gay and lesbian students from bullying.

The handbook children at PCA receive threatens suspension or expulsion for serious violations of school rules or a display of attitudes which hinder the growth of other students.

""Actions such as social dancing, the use of tobacco, alcohol and non-prescribed drugs are not acceptable,"" the discipline section states.

""The same could be said about the use of pornography and participation in elicit (sic) sexual conduct.""

PCA Professional and Ethical Standards

The school's professional and ethical standards require all teachers to ""uphold the sanctity of marriage, defined as that between a man and a woman, and abstain from homosexual relations and sexual relations outside the bonds of marriage.""

Golden Hills' superintendent Bevan Daverne said he was not aware of any student or staff member at PCA who has been disciplined for sexual misconduct in his three years at the helm.

But Daverne said some special requirements were appropriate for staff in alternative programs.

""If we were offering a language school with French or Spanish immersion, we wouldn't be hiring teachers who weren't fluent,"" he said.

""The same is true with our religious-based programming where we're looking for staff who have a fluency within that faith.""",0.7343822778014353,0.7343822778014353,0.0,0.0
259838,True,478,"Canadian Grand Prix cancelled for 2004: official

Updated

The 2004 Canadian Formula One Grand Prix has been officially cancelled because of the Federal Government's ban on tobacco-related sponsorship, F1 boss Bernie Ecclestone said.

This is the first time the Formula One Management Company confirmed information from Canadian Grand Prix officials that the event would not take place next year.

""I can confirm though that a letter was written to the Canadian race promoter following a meeting I had with him when I informed him the Canadian round of the FIA Formula One World Championship would not be included in the 2004 calendar,"" Ecclestone said in a statement posted on the F1 website.

""The reason for this is that the Canadian Government has brought into effect a total prohibition on tobacco-related sponsorship.

""There is a provision in our contract with the race promoter that should this become effective, we have the right not to include their event in the calendar for the relevant year.""

Canada had held a Formula One race since 1967 and Montreal has hosted the race since 1978 on an circuit named after the late Gilles Villeneuve, father of 1997 world champion and hometown favourite Jacques Villeneuve.

The event, one of the city's biggest tourist attractions with an estimated windfall of more than C$50 million ($US36 million), packs over 100.000 fans around the circuit and is one of the few races to draw sell-out crowds.

The Belgian Grand Prix at Spa, widely viewed as the world's ultimate racing venue for its countryside surroundings and technical difficulty, was cancelled this season because of similar legislation.

A leading Belgian politician said this week the race would be on again next year after a ban on tobacco advertising was postponed.

""Our problem is quite simple. The Formula One teams with tobacco-related sponsorship lose part of their revenue when a certain percentage of the events ban tobacco sponsorship. This was the reason the Belgium Grand Prix was not included in the 2003 calendar,"" Ecclestone said.

The A1 Ring in Austria also bade farewell to Formula One this year as Ecclestone last month terminated his contract for next season due to the country's backing of EU legislation against tobacco advertising, which takes effect in 2005.

The leak comes in the form of an alleged internal document which was shared by tipster Roland Quandt on Twitter.

The doc reveals that the Zenfone 3 is powered by a Snapdragon 625 SoC, and sports a 5.5-inch full HD display. RAM is 3GB, while the camera department is handled by a 16MP rear unit and an 8MP front shooter. The phone packs in a 3,000mAh battery.

Moving on, the Deluxe variant is powered by a Snapdragon 820 SoC, and sports a 5.7-inch display. The handset comes with a whopping 6GB RAM and a 23MP rear camera unit.

And finally, the third device whose specs the doc reveals is the ZenFone 3 Ultra, which is powered by SD652, features a 23MP rear camera, and packs in a large 4,600mAh battery. RAM is 4GB, and the phone also features a fingerprint sensor. There's currently no information on whether or not the ZenFone 3 Ultra and the the ZenFone 3 Max are same devices.

Quandt notes that the document is from February and because it's old, final specs could be a bit different.

256132,True,539,"Despite being the backbone of every economy, small and medium-sized businesses have traditionally faced challenges in securing access to short-term financing from traditional lenders. To resolve this issue, the Hive Project today announced the development of a cryptocurrency invoice financing platform to help SMEs overcome the hurdles they face when trying to get the financing they need.

The new platform is focused on providing new liquidity pools for small and medium-sized businesses which are often challenged by the levels of collateral required and the strict credit checks put in place by lenders.

Join the Leading Industry Event!

The Hive Project's end-to-end platform aims to use blockchain to disrupt the SME finance space, using distributed ledger technology to offer SMEs easy access to short-term financing by turning their accounts receivables into tradable assets.

Powered by the risk-lowering technology offered by blockchain, the platform generates smart contracts and creates a digital marketplace through which small businesses can finance their unpaid invoices.

With its prospects lying in its simplicity, this innovation will give companies the option to sell their invoices to improve their working capital, offering a full marketplace with advanced trading analytics for peer-to-peer lending.

On top of that, the company plans to raise initial capital of BTC 2,000 through its token (HVN) crowdsale scheduled for six weeks starting July 3, 2017. The monies will be allocated for technical infrastructure development and the creation of the Hive Invoice Financing Fund (HVNX), which will be a welcome solution to this growing demand for credit.

Jure Soklic, CEO and co-founder of the Hive Project, commented: ""We want to help small businesses solve their liquidity issues by leveraging blockchain technology to provide financing options previously only available to large companies. Our platform will dramatically streamline invoice issuance and settlement processes, optimizing small and medium-enterprises' ability to access liquidity for day-to-day operations and to finance expansion.""

Richard Titus, Advisor to Hive Project and Former SVP Samsung Electronics Visual Display, added: ""The Hive Project helps small businesses automate invoicing and payments, delivering the benefits of blockchain innovation to commercial entities previously deprived of ready access to finances,"" said ""Hive Project's end state, a marketplace with advanced trading analytics for peer-to-peer lending, will rapidly increase the liquidity available to small businesses and expand today's often mercenary ecosystem of factoring and lending.""",0.7761247204054915,0.7761247204054915,0.0,0.0

259494,False,1024,"One of Obamacare's biggest selling points for women is the guarantee of no-cost birth control, a new benefit that includes all forms of contraception from the pill to tubal ligation.

But two years after the rules eliminating copayments for contraceptives took effect, some women are still forking over cash to the pharmacist when they pick up their pills or at the doctor's office when they obtain other forms of birth control.

Just last week, CVS announced it would send rebates to 11,000 women who were erroneously charged for their birth control pills at the company's stores because of a computer error. The snafu came to light when an aide to Rep. Jackie Speier (D-Calif.) had to pay $20 for birth control at a Washington CVS, which prompted an inquiry by the lawmaker.

So did President Barack Obama break a promise? Are health insurance companies and drugstores picking women's pockets?

The good news is that neither of those things is true, and eventually almost all women with health coverage won't have to pay a dime when they obtain contraceptives. The bad news is that it's a little complicated. Because of course it is. This is the American health care system, after all.

""American women don't really know what all the rules are,"" said Judy Waxman, vice president for health and reproductive rights at the National Women's Law Center. ""All this is relatively new, and it's working fairly well. It just needs to be cleaned up and work better.""

Some health insurance plans aren't yet required to comply with this part of Obamacare. Others never will have to cover birth control, such as those plans provided to employees of religious organizations. And as the CVS example illustrates, sometimes insurers and pharmacists just get it wrong, and women have to jump through hoops to set it straight.

""We do hear from women all over the country with what I will call glitches,"" Waxman said. ""Not everybody understands what they're supposed to be doing.""

First, the basics: The Affordable Care Act does require health insurance companies to cover all Food and Drug Administration-approved contraceptives -- including the pill, IUDs, the ring and the patch -- without any form of cost-sharing like copayments or deductibles. This requirement comes from the same part of the law that mandates no charges for preventive medicine, such as immunizations and cholesterol tests.

If you receive your health benefits from an employer and you're not sure whether you have to pay out-of-pocket to get contraception, you should ask a manager, the human resources office or the insurance company. If you buy health insurance on your own, check with the plan to find out what your contraceptive coverage is. All health insurance sold on the Obamacare exchanges includes no-cost birth control. If your insurance company still insists you owe copayments, you might have to file an appeal, Waxman said.

If you don't get straight answers from your employer or insurance provider, or if you feel like you're being ripped off, organizations such as the Planned Parenthood Action Fund and the National Women's Law Center can help, as can state insurance commissioners and the U.S. Department of Labor, Waxman said.

Despite its shortcomings and the confusion around how it's supposed to work, the Obamacare birth control mandate has had a huge impact: Many, many more women have access to no-cost contraception than before the law took effect, as this chart from the Guttmacher Institute, a reproductive health research organization, shows.


Source: The Guttmacher Institute

The share of women who obtained oral contraceptives without copayments rose from 15 percent in 2012 to 67 percent this year, according to a survey by the Guttmacher Institute. Women who used an injectable contraceptive or the ring saw a similarly major improvement in their benefits, and those using IUDs saw a somewhat smaller increase.

The effect on women's pocketbooks is striking: Women using contraceptives saved $483 million in copayments last year, according to IMS Institute for Healthcare Informatics, a branch of IMS Health that tracks pharmaceutical sales. (Obamacare didn't exactly make contraceptives ""free,"" of course, because their cost now just gets included in the overall insurance cost.) The number of prescriptions filled for the pill also increased by 4.6 percent from the year before, IMS reported in April.

That's probably a big reason why this part of Obamacare is so popular. In a survey conducted this July, 60 percent of people said they supported mandated no-cost birth control, the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation found. Still, one-third of Americans didn't know about the no-cost birth control benefit as recently as March, and only one-fifth said they'd heard a lot about it",0.169442474935647,0.769442474935647,-0.5,-0.1

Posted

Perth's Horseshoe Bridge — named for its unusual shape — continues to be a vital link for cross-city traffic, even though the railway line it once spanned is now underground.

""This is one of Perth's icons,"" Richard Offen, executive director of Heritage Perth, told 720 ABC Perth.

""Everyone knows of the Horseshoe Bridge because of its unusual shape.""

The bridge connects the city and the Northbridge section of William Street.

Its birth came during Western Australia's first mining boom — the gold rushes of the 1890s.

""When the Guildford to Fremantle railway line opened in 1880 there was actually a gated level crossing here at William Street,"" Mr Offen said.

""Each time a train came through a gatekeeper would come out and [open and] shut the gates — there were none of these modern boom gates.

""As the population grew during the gold rush, the frequency of trains grew and so did the road traffic.

""The result was gridlock in Perth.""

A footbridge for pedestrians was built in 1896.

Controversy arises after bridge opening

By 1903, the State Government realised it also needed to build a traffic bridge across the railway line — but there was a hitch.

""Because the buildings on William Street were quite close to the railway line on both sides, there was going to be a problem building a conventional straight bridge,"" Mr Offen said.

It was Robert Howard, a draftsman in the Public Works Department, who hit on the idea of bending the bridge around the buildings.

""The bridge opened in 1904,"" Mr Offen said.

""But it was immediately surrounded by controversy, because there were plans to demolish the wooden footbridge and an awful lot of people started complaining about it.

""Somebody worked out that they would have to travel an extra mile each week because the horseshoe bridge was longer.""

The Daily News took up the issue, chastising the pedestrian opponents, in an editorial on July 8, 1904:

The structure had been built practically on the lines desired by the people, and now objection was being raised to the unsightly wooden footbridge which was never intended to be a permanent structure. It was a menace to the safety of the railways, and yet after all that had been done to meet the citizens' desires some people wanted two bridges instead of one.

""As usual, things calmed down and people forgot about that and realised that there were no more traffic jams,"" Mr Offen said.

The bridge was in use until 2009 when it closed for seven months for repairs.

In 2010, work began on the $360 million Perth City Link, which involved sinking the railway line under the Horseshoe Bridge and opening up 13 hectares of land for development between Northbridge and the CBD.

Trains began running underground on July 18, 2013.

The space between the arms of the Horseshoe Bridge is now being developed into a public precinct called Yagan Square.

And although the bridge no longer spans the railway line, it is still in use and now listed on the state heritage register.

""There aren't many bridges of this shape in the world and it has played a unique part in Perth's transport history,"" Mr Offen said.

""They have kept the gorgeous pedestal lamps which light the bridge and it is now going to be a wonderful backdrop for the new Yagan Square when that opens.""

Sadly, that fits what Peter Schiff has been telling us for some time, that the Collapse of the U.S. Dollar Will Be the Single Biggest Event In Human History. It's time to begin making preparations if you haven't already folks…

Mac Slavo at SHTFplan.com writes:

At this point, despite major highs in U.S. stock markets and reassurances from no less than President of the United States himself that the economy is sound, one only need to look around to understand that we are on the cusp of what researcher and collapse strategist Michael Snyder of The Economic Collapse Blog calls the ""early chapters of a total meltdown."" In his latest interview with Future Money Trends Snyder notes that the fundamental economic problems we face can be seen across the globe. The United States, Europe, Asia, and South America are all crashing and no one will be immune to what comes next. It's not sustainable… There's going to be a permanent, massive adjustment and a loss of faith in the current system… as it unravels and implodes we're going to see economic pain on a scale that is historic, like we've never seen before… when this thing finally blows it's going to bring the existing system down.

While most Americans think that near-record breaking stock markets are a sign of recovery and revival in the U.S. economy, Snyder goes on to warn that what we've seen in Greece, Cyprus, and Argentina, and what's happening right now in Venezuela, is a coming reality to Americans.

That could mean everything from bank holidays wherein governments authorize the seizure of account holders' deposits, to a full-on collapse scenario like Venezuela where food, toilet paper and basic necessities become totally unavailable.

Michael Snyder explains that the one asset class to protect and preserve wealth in the midst of crisis is precious metals and well known billionaire investors have been rapidly acquiring everything they can their hands on in recent months. And as we've seen just this year, when panic is the order of the day capital shifts into gold and silver as a crisis hedge.

But that's not all you can do to prepare for the next wave, says Snyder, and diversifying your approach to collapse-proofing your life will be critical because we simply don't know exactly how events will play out over coming months and years:

There're are different strategies that are required to get through a period of crisis, even if it's just a recession, but especially if it escalates to a full-blown historic financial crisis.

For example. if people have money in financial markets they may want to evaluate what their risk is… because if things start crashing are they going to be able to survive if their investments crash to a 40% or 50% decline… can you weather that? Can you survive that?

A lot of people are moving into gold and silver as a way to insulate themselves, to protect their wealth during a time of crisis.

Of course, not everyone's in the markets. One thing I really recommend to people is to have an emergency fund in the case you lose your job or there's a business reversal… you just look back at 2008 and all of a sudden there was a huge downturn and millions of people lost their jobs…

We're already seeing corporate revenues fall… corporate profits fall… Job cut announcements by major firms in the United States were up 32% in the first quarter",0.09595756089653473,0.6959575608965348,-0.6000000000000001,0.0

255348,False,1024,"The International Monetary Fund repeatedly succumbed to political pressure from European governments during the eurozone debt crisis, according a damning internal report on bailout strategy that will fuel debate over whether it should continue to fund Greece.

In-house inspectors highlighted a litany of flaws in the IMF's ""uneven"" response, prompting calls for greater clarity over the fund's rescue strategy for eurozone countries.

Their assessment raises fresh questions over the failure to restructure Greek debt at the time of its first bailout in 2010. The report, released on Thursday, said key decisions had already been reached in Europe by the time the fund became involved in the rescue effort.

Christine Lagarde, the IMF's managing director since 2011, backed some of the inspectors' recommendations for improving internal procedures but dismissed calls from the independent evaluation office (IEO) to fortify the fund's defences against political interference.

""I support the principle that the IMF's technical analysis should remain independent,"" she said in a statement. ""However, I do not accept the premise of the recommendation, which the IEO failed to establish in its report, and thus do not see the need to develop new procedures.""

The fund's involvement in eurozone programmes had been a ""qualified success"" in the face of unprecedented systemic challenge, Ms Lagarde said.

Nonetheless, the report is likely to fan suspicions of some emerging market IMF shareholders and some of its staff that it repeatedly bent its own rules to help out the eurozone.

""It highlights the concerns of many — both inside and outside the fund – that the fund's treatment of developing and emerging market economies is quite different from its treatment of advanced economies,"" said Eswar Prasad, economics professor at Cornell University and former IMF official.

""Political factors seemed to play a bigger role than pure technical considerations in matters involving advanced economies.""

The inspectors said the troika arrangement — in which the IMF worked alongside the European Commission and European Central Bank — potentially subjected the technical judgment of IMF staff ""to political pressure"" from an early stage.

""The European Commission, in the area of emergency crisis lending, acted as the agent of the eurogroup, which in turn represented member states and decided whether to provide assistance.

""Interviews and some internal documents suggest that political feasibility in creditor countries was an important consideration for [European Commission] staff and that IMF staff occasionally felt pressured to accept a less-than-ideal outcome.

The inspectors said the IMF executive board, responsible for the fund's day-to-day business, was in the dark on sensitive policy questions for Greece and Ireland, which also received a bailout in 2010.

Some executive board members, who usually meet several times each week, learned more from the press throughout the crisis period than from informal board meetings.

The board approved the first Greek deal in May 2010 ""without seeking pre-emptive debt restructuring, even though its sovereign debt was not deemed sustainable with a high probability"".

""The risk of contagion was an important consideration in coming to this decision. The IMF's policy on exceptional access to fund resources, which mandates early board involvement, was followed only in a perfunctory manner.""

The fiscal troubles of Greece remain unresolved, fanning concern about regional instability at a time of upheaval in Turkey. In recent days the US has pressed the country's European creditors to allow a debt restructuring to restore order in its finances.

The inspectors, led by Japanese academic Shinji Takagi, found the IMF had considered the prospect of lending to a eurozone country to be unlikely and had never set out how such programmes might be designed.

Related article Turkish turmoil strengthens case for Greek debt relief, says US US Treasury secretary says Greece should be anchor of regional stability

The report said IMF managers had moved some time before the Greek rescue to explore contingencies. Still, the work of special task forces ""was so secret that few within the institution knew of their existence, let alone the content of their deliberations"".

Ms Lagarde said IMF-backed programmes bought time to build firewalls, prevented the crisis from spreading, and restored growth and market access in Ireland, Portugal and Cyprus.

""Greece, however, was unique: while initial economic targets proved overly ambitious, the programme was beset by recurrent political crises, pushback from vested interests, and severe implementation problems that led to a much deeper-than-expected output contraction.

""On the other hand, Greece undertook enormous adjustment with unprecedented assistance from its international partners. This enabled Greece to remain a member of the euro area — a key goal for Greece and the euro area members.""

Weekends when she is in town we take the ideas we've been collecting in our time apart and eagerly start cooking little confections that we turn around and feed to the wonderful people in our lives. It feels a little like we're the Stepford Wives when we put the aprons on (I have some adorable ones) but I happen to think it is a ton of fun to just get girly and bake like we mean it.

This weekend had us making Dipped Graham Cracker cookies and Teddy Graham Cupcakes. Both of which were super easy. Since her and I do this mostly for fun we rarely do our recipes from scratch. Eventually we might progress that way but with our time limited we want to make the most of everything and just buy box mixes. Both of these treats took so little time to make and are really easy to personalize.

Supplies for Dipped Graham Cracker Cookies:

1. Graham Crackers

2. Your choice of chocolate (we used milk and dark)

3. Sprinkles or marshmallows

4. Wax paper for drying

Supplies for Teddy Graham Cupcakes:

1. Teddy Graham cookies (we used two different flavors)

2. Cupcake mix (we used a new kind by Betty Crocker called Fun-da-Middles that has icing in the center)

3. Icing for the cupcakes

4. Don't forget backing cups for easy removal once cupcakes are cooked!

Dipped Graham Cracker Cookies

Steps for Dipped Graham Cracker Cookies:

1. Melt your chocolate in a microwave safe bowl. Alternatively you can melt your chocolate in a sauce pan if you are going to be making a lot of these. We heated it up for about a minute until it was nice and runny.

2. Break your graham crackers into smaller sections (or leave large for a bigger cookie) and dip it into the chocolate. Move it around a bit if needed to cover one end of the cracker.

3. Lay dipped pieces onto the wax paper in rows, leaving room between each. After you get a few dipped, go back and add your sprinkles. This will ensure your chocolate doesn't harden before you can add the sprinkles. We also used little marshmallows.

4. To quicken the hardening process we put our cookies on trays and set them in the fridge for ten minutes.

And you're done! So simple and yet it makes a fun snack that isn't too rich. It goes great with some milk too! I recommend that you keep your cookies refrigerated until you want to serve them as it will keep the chocolate from getting soft in room temp.

1. Mix up your cupcake batter per the instructions on the box.

2. If you are using the Betty Crocker Fun-da-Middles mix then fill your baking cups 1/3 of the way full.

3. Knead the icing package about 20 times to soften it, then divide it among the cupcakes. About a tablespoon per cupcake should work. Make sure you put the icing in the middle. Once the icing has been added, cover with the remaining batter. Bake according to time listed on box.

4. Now it's time to decorate! We used whipped icing and covered it with chocolate sprinkles and marshmallows. Finally, add your Teddy Grahams!

With the lighter, whipped icing these yummy confections weren't too rich; just the right amount of sweet!

I am already thinking of ideas we can try for the next time she is in town. These projects have been some of my favorite. It is great way for us to spend time together and grow closer. Dom has the biggest sweet tooth I've seen in a human being and baking with her is just another connection between us. I treasure these moments.",0.0,0.6876384577688845,-4.0,-0.1
257971,True,265,"best priced managed switch you can buy

Good: Cisco 2950 has 24 ports, all of which can be either used as they come, or can be configured for a specific purpose. For the price, you cannot purchase a new switch of equal value in a store, its just not possible. The amount of settings and configurations you can choose is huge, which comes in handy. The ability to define and implement VLANs is reason enough to buy a switch of this caliber. Bad: buying anything Cisco requires some information to use. You need to be familiar with Cisco IOS and own a serial console cable to configure it. The ugly: the switch I purchased still had old config files on it from the previous owner, which meant it was password protected. I needed to reference the cisco website ( or Cisco CCNA Portable Command Guide)to find the steps to override the password, which can only be done with physical access to the switch itself. After that, works flawlessly. ( which just means that somebody was lazy when the decommissioned their equipment, potentially leaving behind traces of corporate network information) Overall, Cisco equipment is built like a tank, and a great deal to find used. I love my switch, and I'm sure anyone else that is looking for quality equipment will too.Read full review",0.6220383600045282,0.6220383600045282,0.0,0.0

Hi all,I followed with interest the story on Robert Bogucki, the Alaskan who went for a long walk in 1999 across the north west section of the Great Sandy Desert . The story made international headlines as the search was on for him. The locals here gave up on him, perhaps rightly so. Not so his parents, who hired the 1st Special Response Group from the United States of America to go and bring him out....He was eventually found by a media helicopter in the Edgar Range near Mowla Bluff Before the news of his rescue broke , only hours before in fact, members of the 1st Special Response Group found the word ""HELP"" above a cliff in the Edgar Range Here is a picture of it from the newspaper in Perth (The West Australian) from 1999.I had often wondered where this was located, and thought I should seek it out. I asked here on Exploroz with no luck, no surprises there. So I asked the 1st Special Response Group about it and they put me in touch with David Kovar who was on the rescue mission. Mr. Kovar was extremely helpful, full of information though could not provide exact coordinates.He says, referring to a road he calls Looma Access Road, "".....base camp was off the road just to the west of the point where Looma turns south. The tarp was found approximately half a mile from the base at a bearing of approximately 80 degrees. From there, you'd proceed north until you hit a dry (at our time of year) creekbed. Then follow that to the west. Eventually you'll hit a significant drop - approximately 100 feet down. At the base of the drop was Robert's last camp and the worlds ""Help"" written in rocks.""Believe it or not, that info was enough for me to determine the ""HELP"" sign location. So land based navigators - Could you have worked it out?Mr. Kovar provided a picture, here it is:Later Mr. Kovar found some more of his notes and says, ""We came to a location at which the creek aprons out upon a large flat rock (approximately 100 by 200 feet) and ends in a hundred foot drop waterfall. We observed a ""H E L P "" sign spelled out with small rocks on the rock apron with an arrow-pointing north. From the lip of the waterfall we could observe sign and ashes of a small campfire below.""He also supplied some coordinates reinforcing his previous description:Help sign found half a mile west of this location:18 degrees 55 minutes 123 seconds South123 degrees 33 seconds 419 seconds EastThese coordinates are impossible (eg 123 seconds?? Seconds have to be in between 0 and less than 60) so once again I had to try and work out what they meant and it led me to the same spot as I had worked out previously.Anyway, on the 7 July this year I found the spot at 18 degrees 55 minutes 4.6272 seconds South, 123 degrees 33 minutes 3.7584 seconds East.Here I am at the spot where the sign was, as it has washed away. Note the tree, the hill on right and the small ranges in background.There was a huge drop and a beautiful canyon. A bit like Kings Canyon , only smaller.Dave from our party went down to the bottom, there was water there and some fish. Here he is looking across the canyon from where the HELP sign was.We couldn't drive all the way there as it was fairly hard to get down into the lower section where the canyon was. I went back to the vehicles and took these pictures of the crew coming back, and the canyon in the distance.Another one ticked off the list. Thanks a million to David Kovar.CheersAlan",0.18984695073210078,0.6898469507321008,-0.5,0.0
257330,False,1024,"Jimmy Carter is our most unfairly reviled president since Herbert Hoover. He doesn't deserve the rap he's gotten as one of our worst presidents ever.

For many people (especially on the right), Carter is seen as a president whose weakness ruined the economy and whose appeasement destroyed America's standing in the world.

Also read: Former President Carter to be treated for cancer in his brain

To his critics, Carter is nearly the antithesis of Ronald Reagan, who defeated him in a landslide in 1980. Reagan swaggered with the certainty that he and America were infallible, while Carter was humble, thoughtful and said he cared about people, even foreigners. He was honest to a fault (which is not to say he never told a lie).

None of Carter's qualities suited him for the office of the president. He was not the strong leader we crave. But Carter's actual accomplishments in the White House are much stronger than his reputation.

The economy destroyed him, but for most of his presidency the economy performed relatively well, in some ways as well as it did under Reagan and nearly as well as under Bill Clinton.

(I'm not saying that Carter was responsible in any significant way for the economy while he was in the White House; no president is. But, by the same token, Carter shouldn't be blamed for an economy that was actually pretty good for most of his presidency.)

Economic indicators under presidents

Carter Reagan Bush 41 Clinton Bush 43 Obama Unemployment 6.5% 7.5% 6.4% 5.1% 5.4% 8.0% Jobs/month 211,000 170,000 55,000 237,000 5,000 104,000 GDP 3.4% 3.6% 2.0% 3.7% 1.5% 2.0% CPI 10.4% 4.1% 4.2% 2.6% 2.4% 1.9% Deficits/GDP -2.3% -4.2% -4.1% 0.1% -3.3% -6.2% (Average for entire time in office)

Even with a bad recession in 1980 to bring down the averages, employment rose sharply, the economy expanded at a healthy clip, personal incomes rose and federal deficits declined during Carter's four years in office.

Of the presidents who've served in the past 40 years, only Clinton's presidency saw faster job growth than Carter's, and only Clinton had lower federal deficits.

Carter also took the first steps in deregulating the economy — such as the trucking, airlines, energy and banking industries — and was the first to propose that the United States ought to have an energy policy that would include strong conservation efforts and renewable energy sources.

And Carter's foreign policy was more positive than he's given credit for. He's the only president of his century who never deployed combat troops overseas. He negotiated the Camp David accord to end hostilities between Egypt and Israel, signed an important nuclear-arms-control treaty with the Soviets, and returned the Panama Canal to the Panamanians.

However, inflation soared out of control during Carter's term, and that was his ultimate undoing.

Unlike most presidents, Carter didn't kick the can down the road until after the next election (and there is always a next election). He did something about the nation's biggest problem, even though it cost him a second term.

Carter appointed Paul Volcker as chairman of the Federal Reserve in October 1979, just a year before the election, with the explicit mandate of whipping the inflation that had been plaguing the economy for a decade. Almost immediately, Volcker began to raise interest rates to wring inflation and inflationary expectations out of the economy. The discount rate went to 13% in February 1980, and yields on 2-year Treasurys hit 15.4% in March.

It worked. Volcker ultimately threw the economy into a severe double-dip recession, but that harsh medicine cured us of the double-digit inflation rates. Carter never interfered with Volcker's independence — unlike Reagan, who tried to bully Volcker into softening his anti-inflation stance.

Something else happened in 1979 that contributed to the recession and to Carter's defeat in the 1980 election: Iran's revolution, which reduced that country's production of petroleum and contributed to the brutal stagflation of 1979 and 1980.

And here we see the strength and weakness of Carter's character. The shah of Iran was deposed in a popular revolution in 1978. He'd been one of America's more thuggish allies in the preceding two decades, but Carter, who believed the U.S. should act with moral authority in the world, never liked him much and refused to prop him up against his own people.

Carter began to deal with the new post-shah Iranian government. Relations were improving until Carter made a fateful",0.27600175908042324,0.7760017590804232,-0.5,0.0

De Friezen binne in Germaansk folk, troch Tacitus rekkene ta de Ingvaeones, de Germaanske folken oan de Noardseekust.

Oan it begjin fan ús jiertelling skreaunen de Romeinen fan de Friezen oan de kust fan de Noardsee. Om't de Friezen útwreiden nei it suden wylst de Romeinen nei it noarden kamen, moeten de twa folken inoar, en doe't de Romeinen in grins fêststeld hienen, wienen der Friezen binnen en bûten it Romeinske Ryk. De Romeinen hienen it oer Frisiavones foar de minsken dy't besuden de Ryn wennen, en dermei part fan it ryk wienen, en fan Frisii foar de lju oer de Ryn, dy't gjin fêst part fan it ryk wienen, al waarden se al troch de Romeinen betwongen. Sjoen troch de eagen fan de Romeinen wienen de Frisii in nuver folk, om't se libben yn in gebiet dat twa kear deis ûnder wetter rekke.

Meidat de Romeinen weifoelen, begûn de groei fan it Fryske gebiet op 'e nij. Mei it grutte folkeferfarren kamen se mei de Angel-Saksen nei Ingelân, dêr't se harren fêstigen yn de eastlike kriten. De Friezen gouwen yn dy tiid as in folk fan seefarders; sa lyk dat de Noardsee yn dy tiid de Mare Frisicum (Fryske See) neamd waard. It Fryske ryk woeks út oant it yn de 7e ieu rikte oan de Weser yn it easten ta, en oant Brugge yn it suden. Stêden as Utert en Dorestêd moatte wichtige Frykse hannelsstêden west hawwe.

Yn it lege lân libben de Friezen yn in altyd trochgeande kriich mei it wetter. Oan de iene kant wie dêr de see, oan de oare kant it fean, dat omleech gong as it bewenne waard. De Friezen bouden terpen,",0.2976705164648593,0.49767051646485927,-0.1,-0.1
257181,True,819,"Victorinox Pioneer Swiss Army Pocket Knife Review

Founded in 1884, Victorinox is a knife manufacturer out of Switzerland that is the sole supplier of multi-purpose knives to the Swiss army. Which is what most of us know them from, Swiss Army Knives. It is definitely what I know them from, having been issued a Victorinox pocket knife when I started my tour of duty with the Royal Dutch Military Police, some time ago now.

And let me tell you, that little Victorinox knife served me well. Especially when guarding some completely deserted cross road in the middle of a forest, fighting blazing colds, waiting day and night for that one moment when a tank commander decided to have his battle tanks cross the street. We than needed to make sure no civilians were crushed by them. Being a corporal I was the highest ranking guy out there most of the time, which gave a little wiggle room. So at one point we decided that it would be a good idea to bring a small stove with us, a few cans of sausages and make the best of it. And we did.

This pocket knife review is about the tool that helped make that happen, the Victorinox Pioneer. It is a compact multi-tool for hiking, camping, or around-the-house use, and apparently also stuck-in-a-forest-MP's . The build quality is every bit as good as you might expect from a Swiss knife. Victorinox is so convinced of its build quality that they give a lifetime warranty.

The Pioneer is enclosed in a stylish ribbed silver Alox housing that provides a good deal of grip. It measures 3.5 inches overall and weighs a mere 3.2 ounces. The blade is nice and big for a pocket knife as it comes in at 2.5 inches. Its very sharp out of the box, ready to be used.

Going over the tools you'll find a very effective can opener. Don't be fooled, this little thing will open about any can regular with ease. To proof that I opened a can of Tuna Fish, which took me just 59 seconds and really no effort at all. Check out this amazing feat on the video below.

On the tip of the can opener you'll find a small screwdriver, good for tightening everyday screws around the house. On the other end there's a bottle opener, with large screwdriver on the tip and a wire stripper at the bottom. Opposite to that sits the Reamer. Now most people don't know what a reamer is for, but simply put, it is a tool for making holes. One use case could be to make a hole in a branch or pole to run paracord through so you can more securely strap a knife to it to make a spear. This opposed to just wrapping the cord around the branch or pole, something I see a lot of guys do, which doesn't firmly hold the knife in place at all.

The Pioneer comes with a small, yet strong keyring and it has an engraving panel on back. The panel is nice, but not to big. So don't think of engraving a poem on there, not even a haiku. A first name or phone number will be about it if you're planning on keeping it readable.

If you like the Victorinox Pioneer and you would want one yourself you could follow this link to it on Amazon to check it out for yourself. It is an affiliate link, so if you decide to use it I will get a small commission. In case you do, let me just thank you ahead already. I really appreciate that, Thank you.

That's all for now, thanks for reading this far. I'd love to hear what your ideas are on what pocket knife and tool you would choose for an urban setting, and especially why, so please leave your comments below.

258347,True,497,"La Sirena Cigars is fully owned and operated by Arielle Ditkowich as of January 1, 2014. Below is the full brand history:

The La Sirena Story began in 2006 in New York City when Nestor Miranda met Arielle Ditkowich at an event. He was immediately taken by her love of tobacco, desire to learn more and the way she connected with people. Over the course of time he took her under his wing and they both learned from each other about the changing cigar market as well as the cigars that people demanded.

In early 2008, the two decided to produce a cigar that would fit the profile of what today's cigar aficionado wanted. At a roundtable discussion names were being discussed, when Arielle asked, ""What is the spanish word for Mermaid"". The answer was, ""La Sirena"".

With the name in place and a desire to create a full bodied cigar, the team set off for Esteli, Nicaragua where they began working with the Garcia family at My Father Cigars. Over the course of the next few months countless blends were smoked and finally the blend that fit the profile that La Sirena was seeking was found.

Later that year, at the IPCPR in New Orleans, the cigar made it's debut as a gift to those who visited the Miami Cigar & Co. booth. The feedback received from members of the media as well as retailers was outstanding and it was now time to set sail full steam ahead.

In 2009, La Sirena was officially released and today it continues to be requested at many tobacconists nationwide. The brand followed up with its second release in 2012, Merlion, created by La Aurora in the Dominican Republic with the medium bodied, full flavored smoker in mind.

After a successful 3-year partnership, Ditkowich was ready to spread her La Sirena wings and became an independent company. Ditkowich purchased the distribution rights from Miami Cigar & Co. and continues to manage the brand. La Sirena brand cigars are distributed nationwide and available at over 300 retail stores. International distribution is growing quickly as we continue to push through 2014.

La Sirena Cigars main office is located in NY and warehouse in Doral, Florida.

A denial is a common occurrence in a state where florists, bakers and photographers have a legal right to refuse to serve a gay couple.

The Human Rights Campaign says Utah is one of 29 states where it is legal for businesses to refuse services to same-sex couples. A proposal to change that law died last week in Utah's Republican-controlled legislation.

Michael Aaron, the show organizer and publisher of the QSalt Lake magazine, says about 40 LGBT-friendly businesses will be at the expo.

Aaron says the Salt Lake City expo will be the first since same-sex marriage became legal in Utah in 2013.

255804,False,1024,"How to Top The Initiative Order (Almost) Every Time
When I first started this blog I asked the question ""Who takes Improved Initiative?"" I'm quoting the Gamers II, but it's a legitimate question. Many players are so concerned with having the highest strength, the deadliest weapon, or the most destructive spells that they forget one of the first rules of combat; the guy who throws the first punch is often the one who wins the fight. Stop for a moment, and think about all of the times that going after the bad guy turned a challenging battle into an uphill slog through mud and blood. Sometimes it's a single spell, a single alchemical item, or a single sneak attack that can set the tone for a battle and completely change the tone of a fight. If the bad guy goes first it's a fireball, a color spray, a thunderstone, or any of a dozen other nasty surprises that can tilt a fight in the opponent's favor. The same rules apply to the party. Catching the villain flat-footed is a field day for rogues, spellcasters and gunslingers are more likely to hit, and it provides a peachy opportunity to move around as you please while the enemy can't take attacks of opportunity. Now that I've belabored the point about why Initiative is so important though, it's time for a laundry list for making your score the best it can be. Traits
First man to go is often the last man standing. Your initiative score starts with your dexterity modifier, but that doesn't mean that a low dex will doom you to always go last. Taking the right traits can give you a +2 straight out of the gate. While there are at least 4 traits that provide an initiative bonus, you can only use one of them; there's no trait stacking for a bigger bump. These traits are: - Reactionary (Combat): You grew up bullied and constantly fighting: +2 initiative. - Warrior of Old (Racial, Elf): You've been practicing war for more than some creatures' lifetimes: +2 initiative. - Outlander (Rise of the Rune Lords, Exile Option): You were cast out of your homeland, and have been keeping one eye on your back trail ever since: +2 initiative. - On Guard (Quadira, Gateway to the East): You are always ready. +1 initiative, and if you can act during the surprise round you may draw a weapon as a free action. In addition to these traits, elves have an alternate racial trait they can take called Fleet-Footed. This takes away Keen Senses and Weapon Familiarity, but these elves gain Run as a feat, in addition to a racial +2 to initiative. Handy. The Ifrit has a racial alternative that can help out as well. Wildfire Heart provides a +4 racial bonus to initiative, but it strips away the natural fire resistance that Ifrit receive. Tough choice. Feats There are not a lot of feats that deal with a character's Initiative, unfortunately. If there were then there would be a lot of players who always went first, regardless of what the rest of the party rolled. However, there are at least two feats those concerned with their standings in the initiative order should keep in mind.
Really, do you take black over white? - Improved Initiative: The most common feat for those who want to go first, this feat gives the character a +4 bonus to all initiative checks (Core Rulebook 127). - Noble Scion: Your character is a member of a proud, noble family. If you select Scion of War then you may use your charisma modifier instead of your dexterity modifier to determine your initiative (The Inner Sea World Guide 288). Class Abilities This is where the numbers start to really perk up for characters looking to go before anyone else. A number of classes provide initiative bonuses at fairly early levels, and that should be taken into consideration.
I'd do something quick, before it takes a deep breath. Gunslinger Well-known for being fast on the draw, gunslingers get a +2 to their initiative at level 3, as long as they have at least 1 point of grit remaining. Just to add insult to injury, if the gunslinger in question also has Quick Draw and empty hands then the character may draw a weapon as part of the initiative check. Just picture how fast that is. A particularly feared type of gunslinger is the Grand Marshal (Pathfinder Campaign Setting: Paths of Prestige). These law enforcement officers gain a number of abilities, but at second level they gain Danger Sense. Grand Marshals always act during the surprise round, and gain 1/2 their level as an initiative bonus. Inquisitor No one knows the value of striking the first blow like the inquisitor. At second level these fanatics gain Cunning Initiative, adding their wisdom modifiers as a bonus to their initiatives. Additionally, with the feat Grant Initiative (Ultimate Magic 151) an Inquisitor may choose to transfer this bonus to an ally before initiative",0.2790993736060553,0.6790993736060553,-0.4,0.0

The hardware would be the only cost involved, as it would use the businesses' existing Internet connections, unlike the Google-provided Wi-Fi networks running at Starbucks businesses across the U.S.

The plan is to get better Wi-Fi in the hands of these businesses in order to get more users working on Google apps and services, which ultimately means more customers spending more time engaging with Google's money-making products, even when they're away from their usual home and work Wi-Fi networks. This is the same team behind Google Fiber, the search giant's high-speed net and TV service, which is being trialled in select markets across the U.S., The Information reports.

A key feature of said network would be that it could remember a user based on their Google account login, and set them up on any other Google-controlled Wi-Fi network anywhere in the world automatically. This so-called Hotspot 2.0 feature would help in terms of clearing up the onerous task of signing in to new networks every single time. And for Google, it means getting users more friction-free access to their Google accounts and services, which has obvious benefits in terms of its ad recommendation engines and products.

Google ultimately wants to blanket the world in connectivity, because that's the best way for it to grow its user base and get its products in front of as many people as possible.

256094,True,986,"enough for the state to prove that George Zimmerman acted unwisely in following Martin. Under Florida law, George Zimmerman had no responsibility to—at any point—retreat. The state must prove that Zimmerman had no reasonable fear for his life. Moreover, it is not enough for the jury to find

Zimmerman's story fishy. Again, the jury instructions:

George Zimmerman has entered a plea of not guilty. This means you must presume or believe George Zimmerman is innocent. The presumption stays with George Zimmerman as to each material allegation in the Information through each stage of the trial unless it has been overcome by the evidence to the exclusion of and beyond a reasonable doubt. To overcome George Zimmerman's presumption of innocence, the State has the burden of proving the crime with which George Zimmerman is charged was committed and George Zimmerman is the person who committed the crime. George Zimmerman is not required to present evidence or prove anything. Whenever the words ""reasonable doubt"" are used you must consider the following: A reasonable doubt is not a mere possible doubt, a speculative, imaginary or forced doubt. Such a doubt must not influence you to return a verdict of not guilty if you have an abiding conviction of guilt. On the other hand if, after carefully considering, comparing and weighing all the evidence, there is not an abiding conviction of guilt, or, if having a conviction, it is one which is not stable but one which wavers and vacillates, then the charge is not proved beyond every reasonable doubt and you must find George Zimmerman not guilty because the doubt is reasonable. It is to the evidence introduced in this trial, and to it alone, that you are to look for that proof. A reasonable doubt as to the guilt of George Zimmerman may arise from the evidence, conflict in the evidence, or the lack of evidence. If you have a reasonable doubt, you should find George Zimmerman not guilty. If you have no reasonable doubt, you should find George Zimmerman guilty.

This was the job given to the state of Florida. I have seen nothing within the actual case presented by the prosecution that would allow for a stable and unvacillating belief that George Zimmerman was guilty.

That conclusion should not offer you security or comfort. It should not leave you secure in the wisdom of our laws. On the contrary, it should greatly trouble you. But if you are simply focusing on what happened in the courtroom, then you have been head-faked by history and you have bought into an idea of fairness which can not possibly exist.

The injustice inherent in the killing of Trayvon Martin by George Zimmerman was not authored by a jury given a weak case. The jury's performance may be the least disturbing aspect of this entire affair. The injustice was authored by a country which has taken as its policy, for the lionshare of its history, to erect a pariah class. The killing of Trayvon Martin by George Zimmerman is not an error in programming. It is the correct result of forces we set in motion years ago and have done very little to arrest.

One need only look the criminalization of Martin across the country. Perhaps you have been lucky enough to not receive the above ""portrait"" of Trayvon Martin and its accompanying text. The portrait is actually of a 32-year old man. Perhaps you were lucky enough to not see the Trayvon Martin imagery used for target practice (by law enforcement, no less.) Perhaps you did not see the iPhone games. Or maybe you missed the theory presently being floated by Zimmerman's family that Martin was a gun-runner and drug-dealer in training, that texts and tweets he sent mark him as a criminal in waiting. Or the theory floated that the mere donning of a hoodie marks you a thug, leaving one wondering why this guy is a criminal and this one is not.

We have spent much of this year outlining the ways in which American policy has placed black people outside of the law. We are now being told that after having pursued such policies for 200 years, after codifying violence in slavery, after a people conceived in mass rape, after permitting the disenfranchisement of black people through violence, after Draft riots, after white-lines, white leagues, and red shirts, after terrorism, after standing aside for the better reduction of Rosewood and the improvement of Tulsa, after the coup d'etat in Wilmington, after Airport Homes and Cicero, after Ossian Sweet, after Arthur Lee McDuffie, after Anthony Baez, Amadou Diallo and Eleanor Bumpers, after Kathryn Johnston and the Danziger Bridge, that there are no ill effects, that we are pure, that we are just, that we are clean.

258988,False,1024,"8 reasons to dump that cheating doctor (Trenberth et al are wrong in the WSJ)

Hand back your science degrees Trenberth et al.

Thirty eight of the worlds top, most consequential climate scientists sought to slap down the Nobel prize winner, astronaut and glitterati of science, and all they could come up with was a logical fallacy and a single paragraph of incohate, innumerate, and improbable evidence. It's hand-waving on stilts.

Is that the best they can do?

Trenberth and co try to rebut No Need to Panic About Global Warming, but those 16 eminent scientists quoted evidence and pointed out major flaws in the assumptions of the theory. They described forms of scientific malpractice, and called for open debate. In comparison, the 38 climate ""scientists"" offered hardly more than argument from authority, ""Trust Us: We're Experts"" they said as if the lesser beings, who were mere Professors of Astrophysics, Meteorology, and Physics, were too stupid to know the difference between a doctor and a dentist. I mean, sure the 16 skeptics could be wrong, but if the evidence is so overwhelming, why can't the 38 experts find it?

Q: What kind of doctor is a scientist who can't reason?

A witchdoctor.

First — the Fallacy

1. ""Do you consult your dentist about your heart condition?""

If my dentist tells me that my heart surgeon was caught emailing other surgeons about how to use tricks to hide declines, that he broke laws of reason, that his predictions are basically all wrong, or that his model of understanding is demonstrably wrong, then I'm listening to the dentist.

Try this out: My dentist has no vested interest, but has provided years of trusted service and medical training — and he warns me there are doubts about my heart surgeon and I need to get a second opinion (say from a Dr Lindzen, Dr Christie, or Dr Spencer*). So I tell him to ""go jump"", ""what would he know"", and keep returning to the same heart surgeon even though my blood pressure doesn't change and the pills cost $3 billion a month. Sure.

Eight reasons to dump your doctor:

1. His predictions fail.

2. He uses fallacies to reason — like ""argument from authority"" instead of empirical evidence.

3. He's been caught cheating ""hiding declines"", trying to get dissenting doctors banned from publishing their work, and worrying what will happen if his patients realize how little he knows: ""They'll kill me probably.""

4. He refuses to debate his radical treatments publicly. ""It's beyond debate"".

5. He calls people names — ""denier""

6. He doesn't appear to understand the scientific method – when data disagrees with his theory, he throws out the data and keeps the theory.

7. When you ask him for evidence that the treatment works he keeps saying ""Trust me, I'm an expert"".

8. The numbers don't add up. Where's the cost-benefit sums? (Like this or this?) His treatment plan means the nation needs to lower it's quality of life now, … so … our children's children will live ten minutes longer in 2100?

Second – the hand waving attempt at evidence

1. ""long term warming has not abated"". Since when? With no timeframe this is meaningless. The world has not warmed significantly in a decade. It started warming long before our CO2 emissions ramped up. The world was warmer 1000 years ago, and for most of the last 8,000 years. (See this graph from this page).

2. ""In fact, it was the warmest decade on record"". Our records are woefully short (120 years) and badly disorganized, the original raw records are lost, 89% of the current stations are thermometers near air conditioners or car parks, or near tarmac. See point 1.

3. ""Observations show unequivocally that our planet is getting hotter"". Correlation is not causation. Another logical error. Where is the cause and effect link? It's been warming since 1680, but Napoleon didn't drive to Moscow in an SUV.

4. ""And computer models have recently shown that during periods when there is a smaller increase of surface temperatures, warming is occurring elsewhere in the climate system, typically in the deep ocean."" Marvel at out how CO2 the atmospheric gas traps heat in the deep ocean.


5. ""Such periods are a relatively common climate phenomenon, are consistent with our physical understanding of how the climate system works, and certainly do not invalidate our understanding of human-induced warming or the models used to simulate that warming."" Blah blah blah. Spot the evidence. Translated this says: Sometimes we see things that fit with our view,",0.0,0.7431643903985912,-1.3,0.0

Spain and Portugal are grappling with a devastating drought which has left rivers nearly dry, sparked deadly wildfires and devastated crops -- and experts warn that prolonged dry spells will become more frequent.

The national weather office says 94 percent of Portugal is enduring what it classifies as an 'extreme' drought.

'The country has never experienced a drought like this in the sense that it worsened significantly in October, a time of the year when the situation normally improves,' a climatologist with the weather office, Fatima Espirito Santo, told AFP.

Two-thirds of Spain has received considerably less rain during the last three years than it normally does.

'It's a ruinous situation,' said Jose Ramon Gonzalez, a small rancher in Spain's normally rainy northwestern region of Galicia.

Due to the scarcity of grass, Gonzalez was forced to spend thousands of euros to buy fodder for his cattle in July, four months earlier than normal.

'There are rivers, springs, which neither I, at the age of 45, nor my parents, nor my grandparents, have seen dry which have dried up,' he said.

About 1.38 million hectares (3.4 million acres) of grains, sunflowers and olive trees have been affected by drought or frost in Spain as of the end of October, according to Spanish farming insurance agency Agroseguro.

It has dished out more than 200 million euros ($236 million) in compensation this year.

'You feel helpless like when you are sick, you can't do anything. This sickness is called drought,' said Vicente Ortiz, a farmer and rancher in Spain's central Castilla-La Mancha region, whose endless plain is depicted in 'Don Quixote', the famous work by Miguel de Cervantes.

Ortiz said his grain harvest has plunged 70 percent from last year and he expects to harvest half as many olives.

The situation is just as dire for farmers across the border in neighbouring Portugal.

'All crops are suffering from this lack of water in our region, from olives to grains and grapes,' said Fremelinda Carvalho, the president of the association of farmers on Portalegre in central Portugal.

The dry fields and forests have fuelled wildfires, which killed 109 people this year in Portugal and five in Galicia, many dying in their cars as they tried to flee the flames.

- Water conflicts -

Water reservoirs are at abnormally low levels.

In Portugal 28 of the country's water reservoirs in October were at less than 40 percent of their storage capacity.

This weekend about a hundred fire trucks began transporting water from one dam in northern Portugal to another that is running dry and supplies water to Viseu, a city of around 100,000 residents.

In Spain the water reservoirs along the Tagus River, which empty into the Atlantic near Lisbon, were as of Monday at just 39.3 percent of their capacity.

The levels were even lower in the Douro River further north and the Segura River, which is used to irrigate crops in southeastern Spain.

Spain's largest power company, Iberdrola, saw its hydroelectric power production plunge 58 percent during the first nine months of the year, compared to the same period last year, pushing up electricity prices.

The drought is also fuelling conflicts among regions over the use of water.

One source of tension is a massive aqueduct built in the 1960s during the Spanish dictatorship of Francisco Franco to siphon off water from the Tagus River to the smaller Segura River.

The Tagus River 'can not support' this aqueduct, said Antonio Luengo, head of the agency that regulates water in Spain's Castilla-La Mancha region.

The water diverted from the Tagus had been used to massively develop fruit and vegetable farms in southeastern Spain and now water from the Mediterranean must be desalinated to support these crops, he said.

- Climate risks -

Experts warn that droughts are likely to become more frequent and severe in the region.

'Spain has since 1980 shown signs of climate change, which have increased since 2000,' said Jorge Olcina, who heads the University of Alicante's climate institute.

The country's climate 'tends to have more subtropical characteristics. Higher temperatures and rarer and more intense rains. So climate-related risks -- heatwaves and rain and droughts and floods, will increase in the coming decades,' he added.

Spain has managed water 'very badly', said Julio Barea, spokesman for the Spanish branch of Greenpeace.

He cited as examples the use of water to irrigate trees that do not normally need much water, such as olive and almond trees, and the planting of water-intensive crops that are not suited to Spain",0.7699146831738619,0.7699146831738619,0.0,0.0

256453,True,987,"The United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) is one of the first agencies established by the United Nations to administer refugees, preceding even the creation of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). The long history of UNRWA has long been built around its original mandate. The mandate, initially given by UN General Assembly Resolution 302 (IV), has been updated over the years. Today, UNRWA promises to deliver services as a ""neutral human development agency,"" according to Chris Gunness, a spokesperson at UNRWA.

Unfortunately, UNRWA has fallen prey to increasingly polarized and biased rhetoric, pushed more and more often by its own spokespersons. While Israel has raised concerns about Mr. Gunness in the past, there has been no action taken to ensure that Mr. Gunness is returned to the realm of unbiased behavior befitting a human development agency whose mandate, he admits, must include neutrality.

Advertisement

As the Israeli letter to the UN Commissioner-General of UNRWA (Pierre Krähenbühl) details, Mr. Gunness has promoted and praised individuals who buy into the ideology of Hamas, an internationally recognized terrorist organization. Mr. Gunness has discussed the suffering of Palestinian refugees, but conveniently leaves out responsibility for their suffering, going so far as to omit the responsibility of Hamas in disrupting power to 70,000 Gazans by firing a rocket (a by-definition indiscriminate weapon) at Israel.

However, Mr. Gunness has not only escaped investigation, he has persisted in his continued violations of the neutrality principle that underlines UNRWA's mandate. His prolific posts on Twitter are indication of this trend. On August 28, 2015, at 12:21AM (GMT-7), Mr. Gunness tweeted:

""Thx @levy_haaretz 4 exposing the pitilessness of the ""bureaucrats"" of #IsraeliOccupation"". They r many & variedhttp://www.haaretz.com/weekend/twilight-zone/.premium-1.673301 … RT""

(If embeddable, here is link to tweet: https://twitter.com/ChrisGunness/status/637163117051518976).

The ""bureaucrats"", unnamed figures in the article, are doubtless officials of the Israeli government. Rather than maintain an unbiased and neutral view of Israel, Mr. Gunness has both praised and taken immediate sides on an issue related to human interests without investigation of his own. He further accuses Israeli officials of ""pitilessness"", yet another insult towards the Israeli officials his organization is meant to cooperate with in an unbiased fashion. This conduct is unbecoming for any UNRWA official, let alone a spokesperson.

Another obvious example of Mr. Gunness' failures to remain unbiased can be found mere days before. On August 26, 2015, at 4:17PM (GMT-7), Mr. Gunness tweeted the following:

""Interested to find out more about UN Watch's political & financial affiliations since its establishment. Can anyone advise? RT""

His tweet was not a legitimate and neutral attempt to investigate an organization, of course. Just a few days earlier, on August 23, 2015, UN Watch informed UN Secretary General Ban Ki-Moon that an UNRWA school had posted violence-inciting cartoons on its Facebook page.

Mr. Gunness' tweet thus reeks of attempted retaliation, and he solicited information from the social media world in his attempt to find information which he might, presumably, be able to smear UN Watch with. UN Watch, which is a Geneva-based non-governmental organization acting as a watchdog for the United Nations, has been praised by former UN Secretary Generals and other high-ranking officials for their work, and is an accredited NGO assisting numerous UN bodies. Rather than acknowledge the criticism of this UNRWA school and thank UN Watch for their work in keeping UNRWA accountable and neutral, Mr. Gunness decided to block and ignore UN Watch on Twitter.

In light of this, and numerous other documented examples of Chris Gunness' failure to be both accountable and neutral it is up to the United Nations to take action. Clearly the long history of bias and violations of UNRWA policy have failed to inspire the United Nations to take action, and it is time that the world called on the United Nations to appoint neutral, unbiased spokespersons for an agency crucial to the administering of aid for Palestinians. Only with a more neutral and diplomatic individual speaking on behalf of UNRWA can the organization continue to properly function and mediate between the parties of the ongoing conflict between Israel and the Palestinians, and ensure that it is seen as a credible UN agency.",0.6537747054330765,0.7537747054330765,-0.1,0.0

One woman was killed and a man was critically injured.

The shooting took place inside Cuties Cafe at 36 N. King Street just before 2 a.m.

Police said two men attempted to rob the establishment before the shots rang out.

Benjamin Baniaga, who lives nearby, says he was asleep when he heard the loud noises. ""I heard choke commotion really loud, I heard something break then a guy saying 'Hey, let go!'""

Paramedics arrived on scene around 2:30 a.m. and treated 44-year-old Tara Tevaga of Halawa with a gunshot wound to her chest. She was transported to a nearby hospital, where she later died.

Police say a 25-year-old man was also shot in the shoulder. He was taken to the hospital in serious condition and is expected to survive.

Shortly after the shooting, police say they were able to locate and arrest 29-year-old Dane Salanoa for investigation of robbery. He was later released pending investigation,

A second suspect, 30-year-old Alabanza Tuimaleali'ifano, was arrested Saturday night. As of Monday afternoon, he was charged for manslaughter, attempted murder and other firearms charges. His bail is set at $1 million.

Court records show Tuimaleali'ifano was also arrested in May for carrying a replica gun in a public place, but posted bail.

Meanwhile, undercover Honolulu police officers raided Cuties Cafe on Saturday morning, seizing at least 12 illegal gambling machines.

Barry Wagenvoord, who works nearby, says he's seen suspicious activity at the business for some time.

""That café place has been sketchy for a while,"" he said. ""When they first opened up, they specialized with waitresses in lingerie and that seemed to stop for a while.""

Wendy Khoang owns N.K. Wine Shop next door and told Hawaii News Now that fights break out often at the establishment.

The business has blacked out windows and security cameras.

""I always lock my door,"" Khoang said. ""A lot of customers come in and ask why my door is locked during business hours, but I say it's for security purposes I have to do that.""

It's no secret, Chinatown and the Keeaumoku areas are known to house illegal game rooms. Law enforcement agencies have been working to shut them down for decades.

""As long as the customer needs that, there's going to be the existence of these gambling locations,"" says retired FBI agent Hilton Lui, who is now a private investigator. He says he worked many game room raids before retiring in 1993.

Lui says there are actually less now than there were in the mid 1980's, but the way they operate has changed over the years. Lui says instead of a few people owning multiple, large operations, he says, there are a lot of smaller ones now, often run by individuals. He says that makes it harder for law enforcement to devote resources because it isn't often cost effective. ""You need undercover officers,"" he says, ""Then you need to seize the devices and the monies you get.""

""It's not easy getting in there, they have that little security camera,"" says defense attorney David Hayakawa, ""They have to buzz you in."" He says new customers need to be brought in by known players, and undercover officers can have a hard time even getting their foot in the door. Hayakawa says Honolulu police and prosecutors do try, but even after a bust, the operation will often reopen somewhere else shortly after.

""I have always asserted that gambling is connected to dangerous criminal activity, and this shooting is an example of that."" Honolulu Prosecuting Attorney Keith Kaneshiro told Hawaii News Now in a statement.

The Honolulu Police Department also sent us a statement saying they have executed more than a dozen search warrants this year on suspected game rooms.

Seahawks star Richard Sherman, who recently signed a four-year contract extension that could pay him more than $57 million, purchased a Maple Valley house from Seattle NBA star Jamal Crawford for $2.31 million.

Richard Sherman's rise from low-round draftee to NFL stardom with the Seahawks is the textbook sporting definition of going from the outhouse to the penthouse.

So why wouldn't a mansion be next?

Public records show that Sherman on Friday completed the purchase of a 9,475-square-foot home in Maple Valley resting neatly on 4.96 acres. He bought the house from another famous athlete with Seattle ties — NBA star Jamal Crawford.

Sherman paid $2.31 million to buy the house from Crawford, a former Rainier Beach High star who plays for the Los Angeles Clippers.

The purchase came shortly after Sherman signed a four-year contract extension with the Seahawks that could pay him more than $57 million through the 2018 season.

Sherman said Monday the contract won't change him, calling himself still the ""raggedy dog'' who entered the NFL as a fifth-round pick in 2011, regarded by many as something of an afterthought.

""You can teach an old dog new tricks,'' Sherman said Monday, referring to his humble roots in Compton, Calif. ""But you can't take him away from where he is from.''

NFL riches can, though, buy him a nice new crib in which to hang out.

Real-estate listings detail that the Mediterranean-style house has an indoor pool/hot tub, three outdoor water features, a billiards room and game room, a wet bar, a personal beauty salon, an athletic court, two floor-to-ceiling rustic stone fire­places, three bedrooms with private decks and, yes, a dog run.

It also contains 6.25 baths, four bedrooms, six covered parking spaces and according to one real-estate listing ""a double kitchen with two of everything.''

256412,True,408,"Electronic Frontiers Australia (EFA) welcomes today's announcement by Communications Minister Stephen Conroy that the government has finally abandoned its plans to introduce mandatory internet filtering. EFA, through its Open Internet campaign, was one of the many civil society groups that campaigned hard against this policy over a number of years.

The internet is built on open standards, and EFA strongly believes that maintaining its open nature is critical to ensuring that it continues to be a powerful platform for disseminating information, connecting communities, increasing transparency, driving innovation and enabling global commerce. EFA fully understands that such an open network also creates a number of serious challenges for government, particularly in relation to law enforcement and security.

Top-down, one-size-fits-all approaches to dealing with these challenges, such as the government's now-abandoned mandatory internet filter, are not appropriate, nor likely to be effective in terms of outcomes or value for money. More nuanced policy approaches that employ proportionate technical responses, combined with empowering individuals, particularly through education, are in most cases likely to be much more successful.

We are therefore pleased that the government appears to now finally accept that its mandatory internet filter policy was such a top-down approach that was unworkable and posed a serious threat to free speech in Australia.

While the government's new plan, for having ISPs block child abuse sites based on an Interpol-maintained list does amount to a form of internet filtering, it is currently of a very limited nature and involves a degree of transparency and accountability in relation to the list of blocked sites.

We continue to believe that filtering based on block lists is a relatively ineffective approach with a number of potential problems, however, this new policy appears to be a workable approach to addressing one aspect of the problem of harmful content.

We encourage policy-makers to undertake meaningful engagement with civil society groups early on in the policy formulation process to ensure that such poorly-designed policies are avoided in future.",0.8276551492543108,0.8276551492543108,0.0,0.0

California's Population

During the 20th century, California experienced tremendous population growth …

California is the most populous state in the nation.

California's population is one of the world's most diverse.

… but growth has slowed in recent decades.

More than 10 million Californians are immigrants.

According to 2015 estimates, 27% of Californians (10.7 million) are foreign born—a higher proportion than in any other state (New York is second with 23%) and twice the nationwide share (13%). The leading countries of origin for California immigrants are Mexico (4.3 million), the Philippines (864,000), China (728,000 excluding Taiwan; 910,000 including Taiwan), Vietnam (511,000), India (477,000), El Salvador (428,000), and Korea (328,000). In recent years, almost twice as many immigrants have been arriving from Asia as from Latin America.

California is aging but is young compared to the rest of the country.

California's population is slightly younger than that of the rest of the nation: according to 2015 Census Bureau estimates, the median age in California is 36.2, compared to 37.8 for the entire country. California has the seventh-youngest population in the country (Utah has the youngest). However, California's population is aging along with the baby boom: by 2030, about one in five Californians will be age 65 or older.",0.3676502391695976,0.7676502391695976,-0.4,0.0

258521,False,1024,"Casual Arena's team has been developing Flash game browsers since 2008. Within the past year, they have specialized in game development cross-platform mobile and tablet games, studying different technologies and specializing in Cocos 2D and Unity 3D. This article highlights the differences between the two environments and compares them explaining their respective differences.

Development of 2D platform games

Most mobile and tablet game developers want to make their game available for a multitude of platforms, or at least available for iOS and Android. Of course, it is always possible to make 2 or more parallel developments using native code (Objective-C for iOS, Java for Android …), but this is not recommended. The most efficient option is to use a development environment that allows you to target multiple platforms from a single instance of game development. Here arises the first big question: What technology do I use?

There are various frameworks and technologies available to the user: Unity3D, Cocos2D, Marmalade SDK or Adobe Flash, among others. Adobe Flash is virtually only used when your application is already developed in Flash for browser use and you wish to quickly migrate to mobile. If you have a very simple application (e.g. a board game) then it is possible to use this technology, however, if your application requires more processing power (e.g pool games, games with heavy graphics or animations, etc) Flash stops being a viable option. Cocos2D is a comprehensive framework, open source and completely free.

This is the main reason for it being the most used development platform, surpassing Marmalade or Unity which are not completely free. Unity3D has been and still remains the most used development platform to develop 3D games. With new versions of Unity, which include specific functionality for the development of 2D games, it has also positioned itself in a very solid position for this type of game, making Cocos and Unity the current two options for 2D game development. From our experience, we recommend choosing one of these 2 platforms for the 2D game development. But the big question still remains:

What is the best platform for game development: Unity or Cocos?

On the internet, you are able to find many comparisons between these two platforms. When we started the development of our games we read all available data and information and used them to make our decision. The problem with these comparisons is that they were almost all very subjective. Developers who had specialized in Cocos were defending it. Those who used Unity defended Unity. There are really very few comparative expert game developers on both platforms. We have studied and developed for the 2 environments and we have an objective opinion: Unity is clearly a better platform. Actually, a more accurate answer would be: ""if you can afford it go for Unity, otherwise Cocos is a good back up"". Unity3D is a much more advanced than Cocos2D technology while Cocos2D is free and an open source. Consider the differences between them. At all times when talking about Cocos2D (or simply Cocos), we refer to Cocos2D-x, which is the platform Cocos2D extension (initially oriented for iPhone).

Cocos2D advantages versus Unity3D

Cocos2D is free, open source and more up-to-date. Unity, however, is expensive. It has a free license but is insufficient for professional game developers. The license cost is between $ 1,500 and $ 4,500 more per person (plus tax), which is a significant barrier to new developers. Cocos2D uses C++ programming language and light libraries, making it somewhat simpler than Unity. You can see the complete code for Cocos2D, edit or adapt it to your needs. If you are an expert in C ++ and do not want to pay expensive licenses for Unity, Cocos2D is the best choice. It has some very positive features, but there are not many advantages, compared with Unity. It has good physical engines, a huge amount of examples for each and every one of the features of Cocos2D, and a large community of game developers that support and improve every day, etc. But all this done by Unity too.

Unity3D advantages versus Cocos2D

Everything else. Of course, we always talk about 2D, as Coco does not support 3D software.

Design Environment

Cocos2D has no integrated design environment. The design of screens or interfaces should be done with programming, loading images and positioning them with C ++. You can, however, use external graphics editors like Cocos Studio (also free), to help you position elements on screen and configure certain objects. But this editor is much less powerful than that of Unity. The Unity editor is fully integrated. Cocos Studio, on the contrary, is not, and its operation is based on an XML file and it also generates a series of images from",0.21937067382037642,0.7193706738203764,-0.4,-0.1

HE ARRIVED in Houston with $500 in his pocket. A man he met on the Greyhound bus gave him a room until he found his feet. Zaher El-Ali, a Jordanian immigrant, worked hard and built up a small business renovating and selling cars and houses. He is now a proud American citizen. But, ridiculous though it sounds, his truck is in trouble with the law.

Six years ago, he sold a Chevy Silverado to a man who agreed to pay for it in instalments. Before the truck was paid off, the buyer was arrested for drunken driving. It was his third such arrest, so he was sent to prison and the police seized the truck. Mr Ali applied to get it back. He pointed out that he still held title to the vehicle, and that since the buyer had stopped making payments on it, he was entitled to reclaim it. But the government refused.

In most states the police can seize property they suspect has been used to commit a crime. Under ""civil asset forfeiture"" laws, they typically do not have to prove ""beyond a reasonable doubt"" that a crime was committed, or even charge anyone with an offence. What is more, the money raised by auctioning seized houses, boats and cars is often used to boost the budgets of the police department that did the seizing. That can mean fancier patrol cars, badass hardware or simply keeping the budget plump in lean times. In one survey 40% of police executives agreed that funds from civil-asset forfeiture were ""necessary as a budget supplement"". This conflict of interest has predictable consequences. It spurs the police to pay more attention to cases that are likely to involve seizable assets (such as drug busts) and less attention to other ones. A report from the Institute for Justice, a pressure group, calls it ""Policing for Profit"".

An owner can usually challenge a seizure by arguing that he did not know his property was being used for criminal purposes. But in 38 out of 50 states, the burden of proof is on him to prove his innocence. In February Texas demanded to know from Mr Ali whether he had asked the buyer about his previous arrests for drunk driving—as if that were a car dealer's responsibility. It also demanded a sheaf of irrelevant documents, such as Mr Ali's bank and tax records for the past two years. Mr Ali's lawyer, Scott Bullock, argues that this is ""clearly designed to intimidate"" Mr Ali into giving up. Instead, he is suing to have the Texas civil asset forfeiture law struck down.

Civil and criminal asset forfeiture laws are often confused. Criminal forfeiture involves proven criminals. A convicted bank robber may lose his getaway car; a money-launderer may lose the house he bought with his illicit profits. Civil forfeiture is different. No conviction is necessary. If the government suspects that property has been used in the commission of a crime, it files an action against the property itself. This leads to odd case names, such as State of Texas v One 2004 Chevrolet Silverado (Mr Ali's case) and United States v $10,500.

Even in states where local rules make civil asset forfeiture hard, police can get around that problem by calling in the feds. After a joint operation by state and federal authorities, the proceeds are split. This is called ""equitable sharing"". Police respond to these incentives exactly as you would expect them to. Where state law makes it tricky for them to seize property and hang on to it, they seize significantly more via ""equitable sharing"", according to Marian Williams and Jeff Holcomb of Appalachian State University and Tomislav Kovandzic of the University of Texas, Dallas. Total federal seizures have exploded from $400m in 2001 to $1.3 billion in 2008. State data are patchier, but the trend appears to be sharply upward.

Police and prosecutors deny that the system is widely abused. Scott Burns of the National District Attorneys Association says that elected sheriffs would be punished at the polls if they went around seizing property without good cause. But the safeguards are slender. For instance, police can find a wad of cash in a car, claim that the owner was planning to buy drugs with it, and then seize it. The evidence may be simply that a dog smelled drugs; yet one test found that a third of banknotes have traces of cocaine on them. The poor are disproportionately at risk, since people without credit cards are more likely to carry cash. And since the sum seized is often less than the legal costs of trying to get it back, many people never try.

By and large, the police do a dangerous job honourably. But they are human, so giving them a financial incentive to seize people's property is dotty. Why should the money not be put in the general pot of public funds? And seizing a citizen's assets without proving",0.5188737889566741,0.8188737889566742,-0.30000000000000004,0.0
259079,False,1024,"I love making jewelry from unconventional materials. So when I got the opportunity to make some jewelry out of zippers, I jumped on the chance.

The zippers for this tutorial are from K and C Supplies. You can find all sorts of colors and varieties of zippers in the online shop here. (Plus buttons! Oh, yes, there will be a button jewelry tutorial soon, too!)

Let's get started!

Materials and Tools:

3 – 7 inch YKK Zippers. Pick them up at K and C Supplies.

12 Fold over crimp ends. Available at any craft store.

7 mm jump rings

Lobster clasp

Scissors

Chain nose pliers and another pair of pliers

Optional materials for customizing your bracelet:

Beads

Head pins

Lucite flowers

Step #1

We're going to separate each zipper into 2 parts. So flip over the zipper and find the little metal throngs on the back. Just bend them up with chain nose pliers and pull it off.

Then just slide the pull down and off the zipper. (Definitely save this for other projects!)

ALTERNATIVELY (and this is easier, but you lose a little of the length of the zipper.)

Alternatively you can just cut across the zipper right above that little metal thing at the end. Like I mentioned, you will lose a some of the length of the zipper and ultimately your bracelet by doing that.

Repeat this for all 3 zippers. Whichever way you chose, do it the same for all of the zippers.

Step #2

Use scissors to cut along the side of the zipper teeth. You'll end up with a thin strand of just the teeth. (Save the excess for a project I will share later.)

Repeat for each zipper. You'll end up with 6 of these.

Step #3

Add a crimp end to each end of each zipper. Just place the end in the crimp end and fold over each side. Then push it closed.

HINT: I like to pull on the crimp end to make sure it's secure before moving on.

Step #4

Open 2 – 7mm jump rings.

Opening a jump ring may be different than you think. Line up 2 pairs of pliers so that the opening of the jump ring is in the middle.

(I usually use a pair of bent nose pliers and a pair of chain nose pliers. Use whatever pliers you feel comfortable with.)

Maintaining the integrity of the circle, pull one pair the the pliers toward you and the other away from you. Do not pull the circle apart and do not pull to the sides.

This is what you end up with.

To close a jump ring, just do the same, but the opposite.

I also made a video tutorial about how to properly open and close jump rings:

Step #5

Add the end of all 6 zippers to one jump ring. Then close the jump ring.

Step #6

Secure the end to something. (I used some wire and hooked it to a basket.)

Braid the zippers. I made 3 groups of 2 zippers each and just did a regular braid.

Step #7

Gather the other end and hook them all in another 7 mm jump ring.

Step #8

Open another 7 mm jump ring and connect the lobster clasp to one end of the bracelet. Then add a few 7 mm jump rings to the other end of the bracelet.

That's the basic zipper bracelet.

Here are some ways to customize it:

(Feel free to get creative here!)

Make a couple of bead dangles. I used flower beads.

For a video tutorial on how to make a bead dangle, here's a video I made:

Then add the dangles to the end of the bracelet using a jump ring.

Want to take it a step further?

Make some more bead dangles. Click here to learn how to make these dangles with Lucite flowers.

Add them to the bracelet in various places using jump rings. I used 4mm jump rings so the dangles would stay in place, but if you would like them to have some movement, use 7mm jump rings.

Another Version:

Instead of making a braided bracelet, you could make a single bracelet. These would look awesome stacked. Imagine a bunch of different colors down your arm. You can add a dangle like I did here, or just keep them plain.

Have fun making zipper bracelets! Let me know how they turn out!

257755,False,1024,"Astral Projection Basics The term Astral Projection refers to a process in which the spirit leaves the body for a period of time. When the spirit returns to the body, you awaken and can recall your out-of-body sojourn. There are three common types of astral projection. Meditative Many believe the astral plane can be visited consciously through deep meditation.This kind of OBE is consciously induced. You choose the time and place to put your body into a relaxed state of being and allow your spirit to travel the astral plane. Spontaneous Sometimes a person isn't consciously attempting to leave their body. It just happens. Some have experience what's known as spontaneous astral projection or Out of Body Experience (OBE). They find themselves standing outside their body or watching from above. A spontaneous OBE is often short-lived because the person panics and is instantly pulled back into the physical body. Unconscious Since ancient times, those who practice astral projection have believed that the spirit journeys out of the body during sleep. ""In the daylight hours are our feet on the ground and we have no wings with which to fly. But our spirits are not tied to the earth and with the coming of night we overcome our attachment to the earth and join with that which is eternal.""

From the ancient Essene manuscript: Teachings of the Elect While astral projection is a natural state of being during sleep, if you want to make a conscious attempt at astral projection during the day, you will need to train your body to do this through regular meditation. Astral Projection Basics Today, the words ""soul"" and ""spirit"" are often used interchangibly. However, in the ancient texts there was a clear distintion between these two words. The soul was described as the life-force of the body and could not leave without causing death, while the spirit was described as being able to come and go at will. Since most astral projection articles refer to the ""soul"" leaving the body, this causes some to be fearful of the practice. It is important to understand it is your SPIRIT that makes these sojurns and your life-force (or soul) never actually leaves your body. Astral projection has been around since ancient times and has been commonly accepted and used within the Craft for countless centuries. The old wives tale and superstition of Witches Flying on a Broom is actually a reference to a practitioner of the Craft using Astral Projection instead of actually flying. In the past, it was quite common for a Witch to use a Flying Ointment to assist them in achieving this state of altered consciousness and awareness. Most of these preparations used herbs or plants which are quite dangerous to the untrained and can be fatal.


If you find any supposed flying ointment which lists ingredients such as Hemlock, Belladonna, Aconite, or Cowbane posted somewhere on the net I strongly suggest that you DO NOT use them. These plants are extremely toxic and you stand a very good chance of killing yourself. I will list a couple of alternate nontoxic ointments later in this text for those of you who wish to use them.


While working on developing your Astral skills, it is important to choose a place and time where you will not be disturbed. Normally if you are interrupted during a flight, your spirit self will automatically and immediately return to your physical body. It is somewhat of a shock to the system to get snapped back to consciousness in the middle of a journey, so pick a place and time where you can be undisturbed. If you choose to Project while others are in the house, it is a good idea to let them know what you are doing, so if they encounter you in this state, they will not become too concerned. In answer to the many questions I receive on the topic of returning to your body, the answer is quite simple. All you must do is will yourself to return and it happens.


While it is not necessary to use an ointment to achieve an OBE (Out of Body Experience) they can be helpful. Realizing that some of you will now embark on finding these ointments, we have published a couple of flying ointment recipes which pose few if any health risks but will still aid in your experiences. The first uses herbs and the second utilizes essential oils.

See Making Herbal Preparations for directions on making a base for ointments. You can find many of the herbs needed for these ointments in our online Wicca Store .

255636,False,1024,"In a groundbreaking article T. L. Freeman discusses the relationship between actual age and effective age. His conclusion is that the passing of the years goes faster as we grow older. This makes sense; for instance when you are 10 years of age , a year represents 10% of your life , and seems like a very long time. However, when you are 50 years old, one year has reduced to only 2% of your life, and hence seems only one-fifth as long.

Summarizing this work, Freeman comes to the conclusion that the actual age (AA) needs to be corrected for the apparent length of a year (AY). The apparent length of a year is inversely proportional to one person's actual age:

AY= α /AA

The constant of proportionality α is rather loosely defined by Freeman as the age at which a year really seems to last a year, and it was arbitrarily set at 20 years ( α =20).

Now Freeman determines the concept of Effective age, which is simply the integral over time of the Apparent Year from age 1 to the actual age (AA) of interest:

AA AA EA = ∫ AY d(AA) = ∫ 20/AA d(AA) = 20 ln(AA) 1 1

Although this formula results in some interesting conclusions, there are several flaws with this concept. As mentioned above, the choice of the proportionality constant is rather arbitrary . There is no rational justification for the choice of this age, but it was solely chosen based on Freeman's own perception of (the passing of) time. Next, the evaluation of the integral seems incorrect, since its lower limit was set at 1, and not at 0. Obviously, the choice of zero as lower integration boundary yields can not be evaluated due to the logarithmic term in the expression. Because of the obvious problems with Freeman's concept of time perception , it is necessary to redefine the Effective Age on a sounder basis.

In the traditional concept of time perception, one person's Actual Age is proportional to the passing of time (t).

AA = β t + γ

Note the occurrence of two parameters β and γ that are traditionally set to one and zero, respectively. However, each has a clear (though usually underappreciated) function in time perception. The β -parameter describes the rate at which one person ages; some persons remain annoying little crybabies during their life, while others become boring old farts at 20. The γ -parameter describes the origin of one person's time perception. Did you ever meet those proud parents boasting about their little one who is only x months old, and already walks, writes obfuscated C, or recently sold his first dot.com? No, these youngsters aren't bright for their age; they simply have a high γ -factor.

It is clear that with this definition, one person's Actual Age may already be non-synchronous with time. However, analogous to Freeman's work, the apparent length of a year (AY) is not constant:

AY= α /AA = α /( β t + γ )

δ

ε

AY= α /( β t + γ ) = ( α / β )/(t + γ / β ) = δ /(t + ε )

δ

ε

In order to obtain the Effective Age, the integral of AY is evaluated. Note that the integral is evaluated over time, and not over Actual Age, since AA is a function of time:

t t EA = ∫ AY d(t) = ∫ δ /(t + ε ) d(t) 0 0 EA = δ ln(t + ε ) - δ ln( ε )

The lower boundary condition (t=0) should yield an Effective Age of zero years (EA=0). Therefore= 1.

The upper boundary is less apparent. It should be chosen so that at t=t max , EA = t. At death, the Effective Age and real time are again equal. However, no person knows for sure his or her personal life expectancy. This is clearly an issue for molecular biologists to address. However, if we assume for a person a life expectancy of 80 years (t=80, EA=80), we obtain:

Curveball

The New Yorker, November 28, 1994

STEPHEN JAY GOULD

The Bell Curve, by Richard J. Herrnstein and Charles Murray (Free Press; $30), subtitled Intelligence and Class Structure in American Life, provides a superb and unusual opportunity to gain insight into the meaning of experiment as a method in science. The primary desideratum in all experiments is reduction of confusing variables: we bring all the buzzing and blooming confusion of the external world into our laboratories and, holding all else constant in our artificial simplicity, try to vary just one potential factor at a time. But many subject defy the use of such an experimental method—particularly most social phenomena—because importation into the laboratory destroys the subject of the investigation, and then we must yearn for simplifying guides in nature. If the external world occasionally obliges by holding some crucial factors constant for us, we can only offer thanks for this natural boost to understanding.

So, when a book garners as much attention as The Bell Curve, we wish to know the causes. One might suspect the content itself—a startlingly new idea, or an old suspicion newly verified by persuasive data—but the reason might also be social acceptability, or even just plain hype. The Bell Curve, with its claims and supposed documentation that race and class differences are largely cause by genetic factors and are therefore essentially immutable, contains no new arguments and presents no compelling data to support its anachronistic social Darwinism, so I can only conclude that its success in winning attention must reflect the depressing temper of our time—a historical moment of unprecedented ungenerosity, when a mood for slashing social programs can be powerfully abetted by an argument that beneficiaries cannot be helped, owing to inborn cognitive limits expressed as low IQ scores.

The Bell Curve rests on two distinctly different but sequential arguments, which together encompass the classic corpus of biological determinism as a social philosophy. The first argument rehashes the tenets of social Darwinism as it was originally constituted. ""Social Darwinism"" has often been used as a general term for any evolutionary argument about the biological basis of human differences, but the initial nineteenth–century meaning referred to a specific theory of class stratification with industrial societies, and particularly to the idea that there was a permanently poor underclass consisting of genetically inferior people who had precipitated down into their inevitable fate. The theory arose from a paradox of egalitarianism: as long as people remain on top of the social heap by accident of a noble name or parental wealth, and as long as members of despised castes cannot rise no matter what their talents, social stratification will not reflect intellectual merit, and brilliance will be distributed across all classes; but when true equality of opportunity is attained smart people rise and the lower classes become rigid, retaining only the intellectually incompetent.

This argument has attracted a variety of twentieth–century champions, including the Stanford psychologist Lewis M. Terman, who imported Alfred Binet's original test from France, developed the Stanford–Binet IQ test, and gave a hereditarian interpretation to the results (one that Binet had vigorously rejected in developing this style of test); Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew of Singapore, who tried to institute a eugenics program of rewarding well–educated women for higher birth rates; and Richard Herrnstein, a co–author of The Bell Curve and also the author of a 1971 Atlantic Monthly article that presented the same argument without the documentation. The general claim is neither uninteresting nor illogical, but it does require the validity of four shaky premises, all asserted (but hardly discussed or defended) by Herrnstein and Murray. Intelligence, in their formulation, must be depictable as a single number, capable of ranking people in linear order, genetically based, and effectively immutable. If any of these premises are false, their entire argument collapses. For example, if all are true except immutability, then programs for early intervention in education might work to boost IQ permanently, just as a pair of eyeglasses may correct a genetic defect in vision. The central argument of The Bell Curve fails because most of the premises are false.

Herrnstein and Murray's second claim, the lightning rod for most commentary extends the argument for innate cognitive stratification to a claim that racial differences in IQ are mostly determined by genetic causes—small difference for Asian superiority over Caucasian, but large for Caucasians over people of African descent. This argument is as old as the study of race,",0.2784496649301773,0.7784496649301773,-0.4,-0.1

Adopt-A-District Guide is the product of a partnership between Center for American Progress Action Fund, the Indivisible Project, Organizing for Action, Progressive Change Campaign Committee, and Town Hall Project.

Introduction

You've been trying to locate your missing Member of Congress (MoC), to attend a town hall or an event and let them hear your voice. They've been showing up for fundraisers and for votes—including to vote 'yes' on the House's cruel health care bill—but they won't do their jobs and have a town hall.

One thing is clear after the House of Representatives passed their cruel bill to strip away healthcare from 24 million Americans—members of Congress who voted for the administration's bill are not standing up for their constituents' best interests or listening to their concerns. This has effectively left millions of Americans without representation when they need it most.

Adopting a district is similar to hosting an empty chair town hall, except the person in the chair may be a neighboring or near-by member of Congress who is stepping in to help their peers' constituents who are being ignored.

NOTE FROM THE INDIVISIBLE TEAM REGARDING TRUMP'S FIRING OF JAMES COMEY Since this toolkit was produced, Trump fired James Comey, the director of the FBI who was also leading the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential elections and the potential involvement of the Trump campaign. At best, Trump's firing of a person who was investigating him shows poor judgment; at worst, it could be an obstruction of justice and an abuse of power. The biggest problem is what will happen now: Trump will appoint one of his cronies to lead the FBI, and the FBI's investigation will become a sham. We cannot trust Congress or a Trump FBI to conduct an impartial probe. Indivisible groups must not stop holding House members accountable on health care, but we also can't let Senators sit by and let Trump undermine our democracy. Call on your Senator to block all judicial and Department of Justice nominees until an independent law enforcement investigator, like a special prosecutor, is appointed. Our democracy demands nothing less.

Key Facts and Messaging

Key Facts

These are the facts about the Republican healthcare repeal bill that passed the House of Representatives:

The bill will cost American lives. That's not an exaggeration, it's a fact.

The bill, as written, will deny coverage to the millions of people who have pre-existing conditions who will be be stranded without affordable options for coverage.

Voting on a bill that affects 1/6th of the national economy, without a CBO score showing how much it will cost, is utterly reckless. The Senate must hold public hearings and get a CBO score.

Nearly 140 million Americans who get health care through their employer will not be spared—millions everywhere are at risk of losing protections against lifetime caps on insurance.

The bill would mean premium hikes for common issues; over $4,000 for a person with asthma, $8,000 for someone with depression and a whopping $17,000 for a pregnancy (WITHOUT any complications).

The bill cuts Medicaid by over $800 billion which will result in millions of the country's most vulnerable losing coverage, especially working families, children and people with disabilities—all for a tax cut to the wealthiest few.

Message Guidance

Passing health care reform was an historic achievement that truly changed the lives of families across the country, many of whom never had access to affordable care. Under Obamacare, 20 million more Americans have gained health care coverage and the nation's uninsured rate is at an all-time low. There are more positive steps that can be taken to continue this progress—but despite the rhetoric from its opponents, the health care law has never been more popular.

At the end of the day, 217 members sold out their constituents and proved they're nothing more than rubber stamps for this administration's destructive agenda. They decided it was more important to give the White House a 'win' than to stand up for families who have everything to lose.

A vote in favor of this legislation was a vote to punish people for getting sick, for getting older, for having less income, for being female—all to hand a massive tax giveaway to the rich. If this bill were signed into law, 24 million fewer people could have insurance, Medicaid would be slashed by nearly $1 trillion, protections for pre-existing conditions would be gutted, insurers would no longer be required to cover essential health benefits, and Planned Parenthood would be defunded.

Nobody truly believes this bill will make people's lives better. Not medical experts. Not health care providers. Not AARP or the American Cancer Society. Not the overwhelming majority of Americans. Not even the members who voted for it, who can't seem to explain what is good about this bill. And those representatives will continue to be held accountable by their constituents for",0.4440354261547327,0.7440354261547327,-0.2,-0.1

Ralph Abraham is one of them: He practices family medicine in Louisiana and still sees patients a few times a month when he's not in D.C. His reasons for running in 2014 mirror Tran's: He wanted to fight for poor patients who were being priced out of healthcare. But unlike Tran, he blames the ACA for their woes. ""You can put those patients in a box and say, yeah, they've got insurance, but when it comes to pulling money out of their pocket, they can't,"" says Abraham.

Abraham ran for Congress at least partly to oppose the ACA, and he voted to repeal it earlier this month. He puts little stock on what he calls ""speculative"" estimates from the Congressional Budget Office that 24 million Americans—and poor, old, or sick ones, in particular—would lose their insurance under the AHCA. ""I'll be the first to admit that our Republican plan is not perfect and I hope we can modify it so it's better,"" he says. ""But what we have now is not working.""

Tran clearly disagrees. She feels that her physician peers in Congress are more interested in voting down the party line than in voting for their patients. She's not alone in thinking that. Several other physicians have recently felt compelled to enter the world of politics, especially after the recent attempts to repeal Obamacare.

""This is personal for me,"" says Jason Westin, an oncologist at MD Anderson Cancer Center who is running for the 7th seat in Texas. ""All of my patients have pre-existing conditions and I can't do anything in my current role to fight back for them. I've had a lot of patients who have problems with insurance. They're doing well in clinical trials of life-saving drugs, but their access is now threatened. This isn't a political football. This is going to hurt real people."" And he is perplexed by the Republican physicians who have voted for the AHCA. ""The Hippocratic oath I took said: First, do no harm,"" he says. ""How could someone else who took that same oath look at the same bill and support it? I don't know.""

Westin remembers a moment after the election when he saw his 5-year-old daughter fall down during a soccer game. ""I went over and saw that she was fine, so I told her that we don't fix our problems by complaining. We get back in the game. That night, I was venting on Facebook and realized that I'm a hypocrite. So I looked for ways to get in the game."" He realized that Hillary Clinton narrowly won his district in the 2016 election, even though Mitt Romney had easily carried the seat four year before. ""It's a highly educated area, with a major medical center. It's ripe for someone with a background in science and medicine to speak on political issues with authority.""

""If we make our healthcare system better, we need to focus on quality, access, and affordability—and I think the AHCA fails on all three areas,"" says Ryan Allen, an emergency physician based in Austin, who is considering a run in Texas's 21st district. If he does, he will go up against Lamar Smith, Chair of the House Science Committee, whose attitude towards scientific evidence is also motivating Allen's interest in politics. ""He has lately made a career of obstructing scientific exploration and the use of scientific data. I feel that threatens my kid's future, and I think one of the things that's missing from Congress is that ability to interpret data and turn it into public policy.""

NEWS FLASH: U.S. Forest Service closes sport climbing on public lands pending compliance with UIAA materials recommendations.

OK, that's a lie, it hasn't happened—yet. In April 2016, the Access Fund (AF) and Petzl sponsored the second Future of Fixed Anchors Conference. Approximately 60 policy wonks, bolting geeks, and climbing organization representatives from all over the country gathered in Las Vegas to discuss bolting, hardware, removal techniques, funding, liability insurance for hardware-replacement organizations, best practices, worst practices, and bolting as a public service. Another topic of discussion was the imminent UIAA materials recommendations.

The original sport climbing boom of the 1990s installed a staggering number of bolts on hundreds of crags all across the country. Twenty-plus years later, this hardware is reaching the end of its life. Many of these old bolts may be fine. But many aren't. On most sport climbs, if a single bolt fails, the consequences can be dire. Added to that, many of us bend safety rules. Have you ever bailed off a route on a single bolt? Ever taken a victory whip? Or clipped in direct while your partner takes you off belay to extract her dog from a fight?

Fortunately, when correctly placed, modern climbing bolts are strong and reliable enough that accidents are rare. Problems arise as bolts age. And around the country, bolts are aging.

Most of the bolts placed in the 1990s and earlier were made from zinc-plated steel. Zinc is the material that keeps chain-link fences from rusting, which occurs when iron reacts with oxygen. Zinc reacts so strongly with oxygen that as long as zinc is present, oxygen ignores the iron and zinc-plated steel won't rust. Unfortunately, bolts are electroplated (so their small threads can still work) and the zinc coating is thin. The zinc soon disappears, turning into zinc oxide that can scrape away, or zinc chloride that simply washes off, leaving the underlying steel unprotected. It's like peeling an egg. Once the shell—or part of the shell—is gone, the bolt's tasty iron insides are consumed. It takes a couple of decades depending on weather and climate, but rust will ruin the bolt.

Worse, corrosion hides inside the hole in the rock, making it impossible to detect. Even in dry climbing areas, the insides of bolt holes form shady, often moist micro-environments that hold water, then dry out, concentrating the minerals that speed corrosion. The bolt's externals and hanger may look OK, while the internal parts—including the small clips and wedges that allow the bolt to grip the rock and hold falls—may be compromised. Kenny Parker, the chief re-equipper for New River Alliance of Climbers (NRAC) at West Virginia's New River Gorge, reports that on some 20-year-old sport routes he's replaced, one old bolt might be quite strong, requiring aggressive crowbarring to budge. Yet another bolt just a few feet away pulls or snaps off effortlessly. You just never know. Victory whip, anyone?

Bolts may be aging, but in most popular climbing areas, local communities are on task, upgrading hardware with long-lasting stainless steel. Unlike zinc plating, the ""stainless"" process puts the oxygen-attracting metals within the steel itself, so the bolt's corrosion-resisting shell continually renews itself. But replacing bolts—removing them, re-drilling existing holes, or in some cases drilling new holes—requires a significant investment of time and money. In areas like Boulder and Yosemite that have a high level of commitment to reusing original bolt holes, it may take a skilled worker all day, sometimes more, to re-equip a single sport route. Plus, steep rock, use of glue-ins, difficult access, or anchors that can't be trusted even to facilitate re-equipping all add to the time required.

For perspective, a small sport climbing sector such as the Arsenal at Rifle Mountain Park, Colorado, might take one skilled person two to three weeks of full-time work to re-equip. Rifle is a small climbing area, and the Arsenal is just one of its 30 sectors. Multiply that by the many hundreds of climbing areas in the country and you are talking about tens of thousands of hours of work. Not to mention the expense of the stainless steel replacement hardware itself.

The good news is that local climbing communities have been very good at getting this work done and new hardware paid for. Boulder, Rifle, the New, the Red, Rumney, Yosemite, Joshua Tree—these and many other well-known areas are on it. The bad news is that hundreds",0.0,0.7249459738697053,-2.5,0.0

258111,False,1024,"Reaching a long-sought milestone in a bid to elevate diplomacy over war, Iran and six world powers have agreed on the parameters of a deal that strictly limits Iran's nuclear program in exchange for relief from economic sanctions.

The breakthrough came after marathon talks marked by brinksmanship, threats, and bursts of anger from the exhausted negotiators in cloistered rooms in Lausanne's opulent Beau Rivage hotel.

Yet as details emerged late Thursday of a complex agreement to increase Iran's ""breakout time"" – the period it would take to acquire enough nuclear material for a single atomic bomb – from the current estimated 2 to 3 months to a year, the relief was palpable and the superlatives flew.

The resulting ""framework"" deal depends on a complex blend of political decisions and technical wizardry, enabling all sides to claim a degree of victory, or at least that they were not defeated. The most severe restrictions on Iran's uranium enrichment capacity would be imposed for 10 years, with some measures lasting a quarter century and beyond.

But the relief on negotiators' faces masked the knowledge that an enormous amount of detailed work is still required to reach a comprehensive accord by a self-imposed June 30 deadline and overcome political challenges in both the United States and Iran.

""In the end, this success is not final, but it is a substantial achievement,"" says Ali Vaez, senior Iran analyst for the Brussels-based International Crisis Group. ""Finding a mutually acceptable formula on all the seemingly intractable issues on the table was no easy feat.""

""This is fragile, but unlike previous agreements in the past 12 years is not a short-term fix,"" says Mr. Vaez. ""Once developed into a fully-fledged agreement, this understanding can put an end to the prolonged nuclear crisis.""

In Washington, President Barack Obama hailed a ""historic understanding"" that will ""cut off every pathway that Iran could take to develop a nuclear weapon."" The deal, he said, addressing skeptics, ""is not based on trust, it's based on unprecedented verification.""

Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif described a ""win-win outcome"" for all sides, and Tweeted: ""Solutions found.""

""We have stopped a cycle [of escalation] that was not in the interest of anybody,"" said Mr. Zarif. ""I hope that at the end of this process, we will all show that through dialogue, and engagement with dignity, we can resolve problems.""

US Secretary of State John Kerry, whose final, record-breaking all-night session with Zarif ended at 5:53am Thursday, said gaps remained but that a ""solid foundation"" had been agreed upon to give ""confidence that Iran's nuclear program is and will remain exclusively peaceful.""

The key calculation has eluded negotiators for years: Finding a mutually acceptable balance between the numbers and efficiency of Iran's centrifuges – and other components of its nuclear program – and how quickly and reversibly sanctions will be removed. The centrifuges are tall cylindrical machines used in a process called enrichment, in which rotors spin uranium gas at supersonic speeds to harvest the heavier isotopes useful in nuclear reactors or, at higher levels of purity, in nuclear weapons.

So what are the ""key parameters"" now meant to frame a final deal, and how far have all sides come to get there?

Centrifuges/Enrichment

Iran achieved a primary objective – implicit acceptance it could enrich uranium on its own soil – with the Geneva interim agreement of November 2013. Under that deal, which remains in force, Iran halted its most sensitive nuclear work in exchange for partial relief from sanctions.

But the current compromise is severe for both sides: Iran now has some 10,000 spinning centrifuges out of a total of 19,000 installed, and previously had insisted on keeping them all. For years the US insisted that Iran give them all up, then offered it keep a token 500.

The framework deal settles on 6,104 centrifuges installed, with 5,060 at a single site, Natanz, allowed to enrich uranium. For 10 years, Iran will only be able to use first-generation machines, with 1,000 more efficient second-generation centrifuges mothballed during that time.

A climb-down by both sides requires spin: Zarif states that ""we will continue enrichment,"" while Mr. Kerry describes ""dramatic changes"" to the ""vast majority"" of Iran's centrifuges.

Sanctions

Among the thorniest issues addressed this week by Iran and the P5+1 powers – the United States, Russia, Britain, France, Germany, and China – was the speed and pace of relief for Iran from a raft of United Nations, US, and European sanctions on its economy.

While some of his Formula One seats have left a bit to be desired, Johnny Herbert tells Adam Cooper about his FF2000 nightmare

Now the longest serving driver in Grand Prix racing, Johnny Herbert made his debut in Brazil in March 1989 — some three months before current Sauber team-mate Jean Alesi appeared on the scene. Winner of two Grands Prix for Benetton in 1995, Johnny has established a reputation as a solid, dependable driver who gets the job done. But it's easy to forget that when he first hit the limelight he was regarded as one of the greatest natural talents to come along in years, a young man who seemed destined for World Championship success.

Herbert's early career was mercurial, and it all seemed to come so easy to him. A huge star in karts, he won the Formula Ford Festival in 1985, the British F3 title in 1987, and was a leading light in the 1988 FIA F3000 series until his horrific leg-breaking shunt at Brands Hatch. Despite that massive setback, he was in F1 with Benetton in 1989.

You may have noticed that one year is missing from the above precis of his CV. In 1986 Johnny drove in the British FF2000 series, moving up with same Quest team with which he'd starred in FF1600. Far from repeating the success of the previous year, he struggled through a season which almost sent him tumbling into obscurity...

At the time FF2000 was the crucial 'slicks 'n wings' link between the nursery slopes of FF1600 and the sophistication of F3. Ayrton Senna had contested the British series as recently as 1982, while Damon Hill had made his first, unsteady steps in fourwheeled racing in the category at the end of '83. It was the obvious route for 'golden boy' Johnny to take, and he was joined by fellow FF1600 graduates Mark Blundell and Bertrand Gachot.

The car of choice was the Reynard, which had been dominant for several seasons, and even the crack works Van Diemen and Swift teams struggled to beat the Bicester cars. The Maidstone-based Quest outfit, run by Mike Thompson, had been something of a valiant underdog in FF1600, and neat suspension tweaks had given Johnny the chance to shine. Everyone thought the pattern could be repeated in the quicker 2-litre category. However, Johnny's success had enabled tiny Quest to sell a lot of customer FF1600 cars, and his new FF2000 machine was put together almost as an afterthought.

""I thought it would be a good step,"" he recalls, ""but I didn't know if it was going to be the right one. The car had a two-inch spacer between the engine and the gearbox, and the rest of it was exactly the same as the FF1600. Eventually they made another chassis where the tubing clown the side was a bit thicker. Of course it had never been in the wind tunnel... And it was an aerodynamic brick! When I first got the car we had a Raft F3 wing on the back, and the front may have been off a Ralt as well. We tried a lot of really ugly endplates, but it just didn't have any aerodynamics.

""During testing at Brands Hatch we were three seconds off the pace. I told Mike Thompson and the mechanics to go to Dingle Dell, and I'd go round that corner at a speed that I thought it should be possible to take it in an FF2000. I came charging up, down into third gear, turned in about 20mph faster than I'd ever been before, and I went on the grass, boom, boom, boom from one side of the track to the other. All the wheels were hanging off. The guys were all laying on the bank laughing...""

The team became so desperate that it even tried running a rear wing Johnny brought from home.

""Before I raced FF1600, Sisley Karting had moved in to a new workshop. We went up there, searching around and clearing it up. It had been used by a team called Scorpion, and in the rubbish we found this old rear wing. It was a horrible, mustardy yellow colour. Even at that time it was about 10 years old! I thought I'd take it home and have it on my wall. Anyway, a few years later I bent it back so it was a bit straighter, and we actually tested it on the Quest...""

As the season turned into a classic battle between Blundell and Gachot, Johnny was left trailing, only rarely getting anywhere near the points. He didn't even make the top ten in the British championship.

""I used to race with a guy called Jo Lindstrom, who was in the Argo. The Argo was basically just as bad as the Quest was, so",0.6289781160859125,0.7289781160859125,-0.1,0.0

Segments designate specific features or portions of a route – such as a climb, a tricky stretch of trail or part of an open-water swim. Each time you complete a segment, your time is recorded so you can compare it to previous efforts and those of your friends and other athletes.

Each activity type has its own segments and leaderboards. Cyclists compete with cyclists, runners compete with runners, swimmers with swimmers, hikers with hikers and so on.

You'll find that many of your activities contain pre-existing segments, but you can also create your own using the Create Segment tool found on your activity pages on the web.

Earning achievements

When you upload an activity to Strava, you may be awarded ""achievements"" for outstanding performances on the segments you traverse. The different types of achievements are listed below.

Crown — King/Queen of the Mountain (KOM/QOM) or Course Record (CR)

The crown signifies the top performer on a given segment. Crowns are awarded to the fastest athlete to date on a segment's overall leaderboard. Your current all-time KOM/QOM/CR crowns are stored in a special list on Strava for your reference. Access the list under ""KOMs/CRs"" or ""QOMs/CRs"" from your profile page on the web.

258586,True,557,"WASHINGTON—Dredging up a past that Newt Gingrich has worked hard to bury, the GOP presidential candidate's second ex-wife says Gingrich asked for an ""open marriage"" in which he could have both a wife and a mistress.

In an interview with ABC News' ""Nightline"" scheduled to air Thursday night, Marianne Gingrich said she refused to go along with the idea that she share her husband with Callista Bisek, who would later become his third wife.

The explosive interview was airing just two days before the presidential primary in South Carolina, a state with a strong Christian conservative bent, and as Gingrich tries to present himself as the strongest alternative to front-runner Mitt Romney.

In excerpts of the interview released ahead the ABC broadcast, Marianne Gingrich said her husband conducted his affair with Callista ""in my bedroom in our apartment in Washington"" while she was elsewhere.

""He always called me at night and always ended with `I love you,'"" she said. ""Well, she was listening.""

Marianne Gingrich, who was Gingrich's second wife, said Gingrich told her ""Callista doesn't care what I do.""

""He was asking to have an open marriage and I refused,"" she said. ""That is not a marriage.""

She also said Gingrich moved to divorce her just months after she was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis.

""He also was advised by the doctor when I was sitting there that I was not to be under stress,"" she said. ""He knew.""

Gingrich, asked by a voter Thursday about his past mistakes, said questions about his past life were inevitable but that he'd long since sought forgiveness. He said he expected attacks when he got into the race.

""We knew we would get beaten up,"" he said while campaigning in Beaufort, S.C. ""We knew we'd get lied about. We knew we'd get smeared. We knew there would be nasty ads and we decided the country was worth the pain.""

Gingrich spokesman R.C. Hammond flatly rejected Marianne Gingrich's account, saying: ""It couldn't be any more opposite of the truth.""

He told reporters that he wouldn't say anything against his ex-wife, but added that his two daughters from his first marriage had written to ABC to complain that the interview was ""tawdry and inappropriate."" He didn't answer questions about the specifics of the interview, directing questions to his daughters.

In an interview Thursday with The Washington Post, Marianne Gingrich said that within days of asking for a divorce, her husband gave a speech in which he stressed the importance of ethics and family values in American culture.",0.30650537292512303,0.806505372925123,-0.5,0.0

""I'll have over a third of my time available to meet with product groups, and it'll be fun to define this next round of products working together.""

Excellent narration is the cap to the fascinating and enjoyable novel. As much as I enjoyed this novel, I can see that many people would really not appreciate it. This is largely an inner stream of consciousness and there are a lot of four letter words and frank thoughts about sex and death. In the first chapter involving a death from cancer I was literally laughing and crying and nauseated and uplifted at the same time. I don't mean alternately, I mean at the very same instant. This is pretty unusual writing. I was thinking Gen-X meets James Joyce. The characters, even some very minor characters, are quite well presented. If you want a story where the protagonist faces adversity only to take heart and overcome, you might not want this book (but maybe you should read it anyway). The characters do change, but not in pat ways, instead in the ways people really change. The protagonist is often not very likeable, yet he is human and the beauty of his existence sporadically flashes through. I am nearly as far as it gets from being a Gen-Xer but I really liked this book. The narration more than does justice to the text, shouting and crying, mumbling and enunciating when the writing called for it.

Assaad, who grew up in Lebanon, learnt to drive by the age of 13 and soon caught the eye of the country's education minister who helped secure her a scholarship to study medicine, reported UAE based The National on Sunday.

""Since day one, Iqbal stood out as a very mature and professional student despite her age and experience,"" says one of her professors at the Cornell branch in Qatar, Dr. Imad Makki.

The prodigy grew up in Bar Elias, a small village in the Bekaa valley, after her parents arrived in Lebanon.

According to The National she visited relatives in Palestinian refugee camps and was struck from a young age by the poverty she witnessed.


Although UNRWA provides basic medical care facilities, it cannot pay for more advanced medical cases, meaning refugees often ""face a choice between forgoing essential medical treatment and falling deeply into debt,"" as the organization's website explains.

""It was seeing that refugees don't have any type of medical insurance,"" Iqbal says. ""Only if this person has money and can afford things at the hospital, then he can get the medical care he needs.""

Iqbal aims to return to her home to pursue a career as a doctor, ""I want to come back the Middle East between Qatar and Lebanon,"" she says.

Executive Vice President Wayne LaPierre and the NRA are targeting 14 bills. (Photo: Evan Vucci, AP) Story Highlights The NRA spent $700,000 on federal lobbying during first three months of the year

The NRA has spent $125,000 more on lobbying this year than it did during the first quarter of 2012

Monday is the deadline to submit reports on lobbying activity

WASHINGTON – The National Rifle Association stepped up its lobbying activity during the first three months of the year, spending $700,000 as it sought to fend off new efforts to pass gun-safety legislation, new lobbying reports show.

By comparison, the NRA spent $575,000 on lobbying during the first three months of 2012.

Among the 14 bills targeted by NRA's lobbyists: proposals to ban assault-style weapons and to expand background checks for gun purchases – measures pushed by President Obama following last December's shootings that killed 26 children and educators at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn.

USA TODAY POLL: Public support for gun control ebbs

The Senate last week failed to pass a measure prohibiting assault weapons or a compromise bill to strengthen background checks, both of which the NRA opposed. Senators did approve amendments that seek to limit the public release of gun-ownership information and that encourage mental-health awareness and school-violence prevention efforts.

Monday is the deadline for interest groups, companies and others with business before the federal government to submit reports, detailing their lobbying activity during the first quarter of the year.

As of midafternoon, new lobbying reports had not been filed on behalf of the leading gun-control groups, including Americans for Responsible Solutions, a new group led by former Arizona congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords, who was shot in the head while meeting with constituents in January 2011. The group recently hired two lobbying firms to advance its agenda on Capitol Hill.

In the past, gun-control advocates have failed to match the NRA's spending. The Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence, for instance, spent $40,000 on lobbying last year – an amount dwarfed by the $2.5 million spent by the NRA in 2012.

The NRA's filing shows it employs 12 in-house lobbyists, including its highly visible executive vice president, Wayne LaPierre.

259640,True,266,"If Donald Trump is telling the truth when he says he has no interest in starting a TV network after the election, he sure has a weird way of showing it. From Jared Kushner's meetings with media industry ""deal-makers"" to the launch of a nightly Facebook Live broadcast, signs continue to point to the eventual launch of Trump TV.

258087,True,803,"If I had to choose one word to describe Killing Floor 2, it's gruesome. It's a cooperative, zombie-killing shooter that aims to produce realism in its weaponry and environments, but all of that is buried under the blood and gore of the monsters you kill. There are many interesting things about the game from the preview I saw recently, from a huge number of animations for each gun and each enemy, to a deep perk system that makes you strategize and pick a combination of abilities to play with. But I barely gave these promising elements a thought, because, in this game, gratuitous violence masks what otherwise seems to be a good, competent shooter.

Developer Tripwire claims that it's putting a lot of effort into making better, more varied guns and melee weapons. From my short look at the game, the team is on the right track. Guns are precisely modeled to be nearly identical to their real-life counterparts in both appearance and behavior. Separate gun parts move independently of one another, so that when you look down a gun's sights, the barrel sways differently than the body. Buckles on the sides of guns jump around as you fire.

And the levels are beautiful. Water reflects light from street lamps as sparks fly and lights flash. Each level has its own story to tell: one shows you how the monsters are created, another presents a decimated and abandoned Paris filled with hints of the people who lived there before.

However, these levels literally get covered in blood. When you shoot an enemy, its wound trails crimson until it dies. Unlike other games, this blood never fades. For the entire game, the pools of blood stick around, growing bigger and bigger until the ground and the walls are nothing more than canvases of red. Instead of looking upon a visually impressive, dynamic level, you're looking at a sea of blood.

This is just one part of a brand new gore system that Tripwire has implemented in Killing Floor 2. Called the M.E.A.T. System (Massive Evisceration And Trauma), it aims to make each shot brutal and destructive. Instead of five points of dismemberment as in the original Killing Floor, KF2 features nineteen. A monster's head has five places alone where it can be fragmented, and if you're accurate enough, you can blow off pieces of the skull to expose the brain. If you opt to use a shotgun instead of a precision weapon, you'll be greeted with even more gore. Raking a zombie with shotgun shells can tear it in half.

And there's no need to try to keep zombies alive if you want to see their bodies break apart: dead bodies can still be fully dismembered. The developer even showcased one instance in which a shotgun blast launched a monster up into the air, and then using slow motion the player juggled the body by shooting it, breaking it apart before it hit the ground.

The evisceration was so pervasive that it seemed gratuitous. I couldn't focus on anything else, even though there seems to be a good game in Killing Floor 2. Without the M.E.A.T. system, the game is a cooperative shooter with stunning levels, lovingly crafted guns, and a deep perk system. Tripwire has also overhauled enemy AI to give each creature type unique abilities that change with the difficulty you're playing on. Shooting looks good, environments are beautiful, and the enemies are appropriately scary.

With the extreme violence, it seemed like almost more of a circus show, a display of the twisted and broken anatomy of these monsters. Tripwire has a good foundation for a game in Killing Floor 2. Now, they have to prove that they can balance the gruesome violence with the rest of the game when it launches this year for PC. As it stands now, painting a level in blood only made me forget about the entertaining game underneath.",0.6552311448334164,0.7552311448334164,-0.1,0.0

255927,True,771,"A Los Angeles jury awarded a woman a $417 million verdict yesterday. The jury found that Johnson & Johnson failed to adequately warn users of the cancer risks of the talc in its baby powder.

The jury's 9-3 vote to hold J&J liable for not warning Eva Echeverria about cancer risks is a huge blow to the company, which is facing thousands of such claims across the country. The verdict consists of $70 million in compensatory damages and $347 million in punitive damages, according to Reuters.

No clear link connects talcum powder to ovarian cancer. Some case-control studies, based on asking women who have ovarian cancer about their history, have found a slightly increased risk. But as the American Cancer Society notes, those kinds of studies can be biased because they rely on a person's memory of talc use years after the fact.

Two prospective cohort studies, which don't suffer from that type of hindsight bias, found no increased risk.

It is plausible, scientists say, that talcum powder applied to the genitals could travel through the vagina and into the ovaries, causing inflammation. Since inflammation increases the risk of cancer, it's possible that talc causes cancer. But, again, the two most rigorous studies didn't find any link.

Harvard University epidemiologist Daniel Cramer has published several studies, beginning in 1982, that found a link between talc exposure and increased ovarian cancer. Cramer worked as a paid consultant for the plaintiff's lawyers in a St. Louis case that resulted in a $72 million verdict against J&J.

Talc, a clay mineral found around the world, is often used in powder form as a moisture-absorbing product and sold as talcum powder. ""Baby powder"" is a marketing term for cosmetic products that can be made from corn starch, talc, and other powders. Earlier versions of talcum powder sometimes contained asbestos, a known cancer-causing agent. But asbestos hasn't been present in talcum powder in the US since the 1970s.

Landmark verdict

The Echeverria case was the first California talc case to go to trial, and the jury's massive figure will set a new standard for the many talc cases to come. Hundreds more are in earlier stages of litigation in California alone.

The 63-year-old woman used J&J's products for decades before she developed terminal ovarian cancer. Echeverria's lawyers said that J&J encouraged women to use the product, despite knowing about studies linking talc and ovarian cancer.

The case was the first state trial outside of Missouri, Bloomberg reported. J&J has faced five Missouri trials over the last two years and lost four of them. The company has been hit with verdicts as high as $110 million.

""J&J needs to see they not only have verdicts against them in St. Louis; they now also have them in Los Angeles,"" Mark Robinson, Echeverria's lawyer, told Bloomberg. ""There's a problem all over the country with women using talcum powder on a daily basis for 10, 20, 30, 40 years.""

J&J has said they will appeal the case.

""We are guided by the science, which supports the safety of Johnson's Baby Powder,"" a J&J spokesperson told Bloomberg. ""We are preparing for additional trials in the US, and we will continue to defend the safety of Johnson's Baby Powder.""

259863,True,801,"Can you drive snow and winter tires year round? It's an idea that occurs to many drivers who experience winter weather: If I have to mount snow tires every year, why don't I just keep them on my vehicle all the time?

Unfortunately, using snow tires year round isn't recommended. In the long run, it will cost more money than changing them out and could compromise your vehicle's performance on the road. That's why tire makers offer different types of tires for different seasons – the best option for you is determined by many factors including climate, driving style, and performance needs.

Here are some specific reasons why year-round use of winter tires is not advised. And if it's the hassle of tire mounting, unmounting, and remounting that you're tired of, we've included an idea for simplifying that process, too.

First, what is a Winter Tire?

All winter tires, whether studless or studded, are made to maintain better traction in extreme cold, and on icy, snowy, or slushy roads. The rubber is able to remain softer, which makes it more flexible, allowing the tire to conform to the road better in extremely cold conditions. This feature, along with deeper tread depths and specialized tread designs, are what make snow/winter tires ideal for inclement winter weather and extreme cold driving conditions.

We use this analogy - tennis shoes. Yes, you can wear tennis shoes on the beach or in the snow, but wouldn't it be better to have flip flops on the beach and boots for the snow? Winter tires are like snow boots for your car.

Why You Shouldn't Use Winter Tires Year-Round

Winter tires are specially designed for cold temperatures and winter precipitation. Once it gets warm, you won't need deep tread depths to handle snow or biting edges for traction on ice. Here are some specific reasons why using winter tires year round is not recommended.

Faster wear on warm, dry pavement - the tread rubber of winter tires is considerably more flexible than that of all season and summer tires. That same pliable tread rubber that adds traction in winter will wear down quickly in warm temperatures. Summer and all-season tires are built to withstand warm temperatures, providing long wear life.

Decreased performance - In warm weather, winter tires won't provide the same handling capabilities as summer or all-season tires. Imagine if you needed to make a quick maneuver and your tires were soft and squishy. You won't get the crisp response from a winter tire in warm weather. Winter tires need that flexibilitity to handle ice and snow, but it's not as useful in warm weather.

The specialized compounds and tread designs of winter tires are not designed for optimal warm climate performance and wear. Generally speaking, the softer tread of a winter tire will wear out faster in warmer temperatures. If you keep winter tires on your vehicle after winter has come and gone, you will have to replace them sooner than had you removed them for springtime.

That's why using snow tires year round is more expensive than mounting them seasonally. The sooner they wear out, the sooner you have to replace them.

Simplify Tire Re-Mounting

Driving on snow tires year-round could compromise optimal tread wear and ultimately be more expensive than just changing tires out for the season.

If you were considering year-round use of winter tires because you were tired of having to change them, here's an idea that could save you time and money. Purchase wheels with the same diameter and bolt pattern as your current wheels. Mount your snow tires on those and store them in the garage until winter arrives.

Instead of having to change out your tires each season, just have a technician change the wheels. It's a quick, relatively inexpensive alternative to mounting and unmounting snow tires every season.",0.07949342240842236,0.7794934224084225,-0.6000000000000001,-0.1

Medarot 8

メダロット8 Genre RPG Platform Nintendo 3DS Developer Delta Arts Publisher Rocket Company Release Date JP: August 28, 2014


Medarot 8 is the eighth main installment in the Medarot series, released on August 28, 2014 for the Nintendo 3DS.

The game features a new cast of characters and over 200 Medarots to collect. Like previous games, it was released in Kabuto and Kuwagata versions where the player starts with Metabee or Rokusho, respectively.

The story follows a new protagonist named Salt (ソルト) and his adventures as part of the Laurel Detective Bureau, which investigates Medarot-related crimes.

edit] Battle system changes

The battle system has undergone several major changes in Medarot 8:

The players now choose which Medarot to target when attacking or using a support action.

When attacked, the player can choose which part to defend/evade with, giving them control over which parts are destroyed first.

The team's leader Medarot is not revealed until their head part has been damaged.

The mechanics for existing attacks/actions have been changed.

edit] Fan-made Medarot contest

A contest for fans to create their own original Medarot (or ""Ori-Meda"") for Medarot 8 was held prior to the game's release on Niconico Seiga. The contest was open for 2 months and received over 2000 entries. The three grand prize winners, to be added to the game as DLC at a later date, were Haikara-Mate (a schoolgirl type), Kimengar (an oni gargoyle type), and Time Faller (a clock type). There were also 10 runners up who received prizes but did not make it into the game.

As a reward for entering, everyone who submitted a Medarot design also received an in-game password for a downloadable battle music track (Medarot 2's ""Strike Enemy"") and a Star Medal (otherwise unobtainable).

edit] Pre-order bonus

Players who pre-ordered the game received a soundtrack CD featuring the new music tracks used in Medarot 8. The two versions received different soundtrack CDs, featuring completely different music tracks and artwork.

256524,False,1024,"There's no way around the fact that Marvel's Netflix Iron Fist had the highest hill to climb of the four Defenders . Daredevil was easy enough to sell as a traditional superhero, while Jessica Jones built off that credibility to bring us a different type of hero , whose cynical tone and stellar cast created something wholly unique. Luke Cage got to pivot into a world we'd already explored, adding flavors of hip-hop and Blaxploitation to timely and vital issues. Iron Fist has always been the outlier here, and it's no surprise that reports claimed Marvel was uncertain how to angle its interpretation , especially in light of the racial controversy swirling around Finn Jones ' casting as Danny Rand .

As a lead-in to The Defenders , the hope was that Iron Fist could lean into its more mystical elements, but the end result feels much closer to a spaced-out retelling of Batman Begins , minus the fact that Jones' Danny Rand lacks any of the self-awareness or purpose of Bruce Wayne, and, frankly, comes across as a petulant brat most of the time. Without Alfred to ground him, and no urgent mission to focus the early episodes, we wind up with three shows worth of Danny wandering into people's personal space, presumptuously expecting their embrace, and attempting to reclaim a corporate majority shareholder position that – by his own admission! – he has no idea what to do with.

Danny Rand is Marvel's Dumb, Idiot Man-Child Batman .

Marvel / Netflix

It's not Finn Jones' fault, and I don't relish the thought of a young actor being made the poster child for a racially-charged comic's history, but the whole of Iron Fist feels notably underwritten when viewed through that lens. Danny is painted as a child trapped by the surreal trauma of his past. Think Big without Tom Hanks ' charisma, so that Danny registers more immature than enlightened, more arrogant than experienced (never thought I'd use the phrase ""chi-splaining""). His occasional flashes of charm never balance the disruption he brings everyone around him.

Along for this rampage through common sense are Jessica Stroup and Tom Pelphrey as Danny's childhood companions Joy and Ward Meachum, plus Jones' fellow Game of Thrones alum Jessica Henwick as Colleen Wing , a karate teacher that winds up becoming Danny's reluctant partner. The former two seem equally under-thought, vacillating between pseudo-antagonists and sympathetic sounding boards. Dancing around all of this is David Wenham's shadowy patriarch Harold Meachum , who is given nothing to do but ponder Danny's return from afar, remind a beleaguered Ward to do his bidding and – I kid you not – cultivate a borderline dominant/submissive relationship with his personal assistant.

Henwick's Colleen Wing feels like the most fully-realized character, as someone who matches Danny's world for both wits and fists. Like Danny, Colleen only truly comes alive in the middle of a fight, but unlike our immortal Iron Fist, she displays an interior life beyond the ring. It's a rich supporting performance, albeit one Iron Fist initially overlooks to spend three episodes on Danny convincing others he's actually who he claims.

Marvel / Netflix

You may have noticed that I've spent five paragraphs without much mention of the actual fights, which could have redeemed a lot of Iron Fist 's flaws. It won't take a student of martial-arts cinema to recognize that most of the show's fight choreography as a rehash of Marvel's Daredevil with a little more kung fu style. There was a real opportunity here to up the visual ante before Defenders , and while occasional moments keep things lively, like the requisite hallway fight turning into a split-screen elevator battle, truly dynamic sequences are few and far between.

The honest truth is that Iron Fist needed to be so much weirder than it actually is, akin to how Doctor Strange essentially re-told the Iron Man story with enough out-there visuals and eccentric supporting characters to paper over any shortcomings. Iron Fist starts to show signs of life in its sixth episode (a very video game-like, RZA-directed outing ), but the slog in getting there is too great an ask, especially when the vast majority of the principal characters feel so spectacularly underdeveloped.

This is an origin story of a man stranded in the mystical world, mastering martial arts from characters with names like ""Lei-Kung the Thunderer,"" and fighting an actual freaking dragon named ""Shou-Lao the Undying."" Why are we stuck with Batman Begins by way of Suits ?

AND ANOTHER THING …

If it wasn't already apparent, don't expect anything terribly memorable from the opening credits, visually or musically.

I am deeply amused by a character who suddenly rationalizes M+Ms as the solution to her problem, and apparently keeps bags of them behind her desk for just such an occasion.

256687,False,1024,"60 Reasons Why the Bible Is Not A Perfect Text Written by Joe Pettit Keep in mind that I am trying to persuade a reader of this list that the Bible is not the inerrant and literal words of God. I am not trying to prove such a conclusion. The clever, although usually very implausible, use of verbal and historical gymnastics can probably get around most of the problems on this list. However, such acts of contextual and verbal contortion are always far less persuasive than the simple and single conclusion that the Bible is a human text that is responding to God in often profound, but also inconsistent, contrary, and necessarily flawed ways. Note: Most of what follows is a discussion of New Testament texts. I simply have not studied the Jewish scriptures as much as I have Christian texts. Also, some of the problems may seem insignificant, and they probably are, but the point is that even insignificant problems should never appear in a text that is literally and inerrantly from God; that is, they should not appear in a perfect text, whereas their presence in profound but flawed human texts is easy to explain. If, after reading this, you wonder what it is that I actually believe as one who calls himself a Christian, I have tried to make that clearer here [Sources: Most of the following is heavily dependent on Bart Ehrman's The New Testament: A Historical Introduction to the Early Christian Writings, 3rd edition. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2004, and on Ehrman's Misquoting Jesus: The Story Behind Who Changed the Bible and Why. New York: HarperCollins Publishers, 2005] Textual Problems Often, the texts of the Bible themselves are difficult, and likely impossible, to reconcile to each other. This is easy to explain if they were written by many different fallible people at many different times and places. It is very difficult to explain if the texts are from God. 1. The Order of Creation: In the first chapter of Genesis, animals are created before humans (1:20-24, 1:26-27), but in the second chapter, man is created before the animals (2:7, 2:19). 2. The Iniquity of the Father: In Exodus 34:7 we are told that the iniquity of the father will be visited upon the children and upon their children ""unto the fourth generation."" But in Ezekiel 18:20 we are told that ""the son shall not bear the iniquity of the father."" Moreover, Ezekiel explicitly repudiates the Exodus interpretation. 3. Noah and the Flood: Upon careful examination, it becomes clear that there are two stories of Noah and the flood and that these stories have some rather significant differences. Most of us are familiar with the version that has Noah bringing one pair of every animal on to the Ark (7:8-15), where it rained for 40 days and forty nights (7:4, 8:6), and that after 54 days (two weeks after the 40 days were over) the waters had receded enough that the dove released by Noah did not return. However, there is another version of the story where Noah takes seven pairs of every ""clean"" beast (7:2) and only one pair of every unclean beast; where it first rains for 150 days, and then takes another 150 days (10 months from the start of the flood) for the first mountain tops to appear. Also, rather strangely, Noah and his family enter the Ark twice; once at 7:7 and then again at 7:13. There is a fine demonstration of how the two different versions of the Noah story are woven together at http://www.energion.com/rpp/flood.shtml . There is one additional problem with the Noah story. It is almost identical to another flood story told in the Epic of Gilgamesh, a text much older than the account of Noah. In the Epic we read of a man warned by a god to build a boat because another god who is tired of the noise of humanity is going to destroy every human being. After the man's boat comes to rest on a mountain, he releases a bird three times (just like Noah), only he first releases a dove, then a sparrow, and then a raven (Noah actually releases a raven as well at 8:7, we just never hear or read about it). The man sacrifices on a mountain to the god who saved him, just like Noah. It is difficult to avoid concluding that the authors of the Noah stories were ""influenced"" by the Epic of Gilgamesh. 4. Many Languages, or One? In chapter 10 of Genesis, we get a long account of the many peoples and many languages that descend from Noah and of the many lands that they occupied (10:5, 20, 31-32). However, after this, we are told in the set up for the Tower of Babel story that whole land had only one language and that they all managed to settle on only one plain",0.5552205847027318,0.7552205847027319,-0.2,0.0
255871,False,1024,"The Facts on Unclaimed Land and Property in the UK

By: Garry Crystal - Updated: 19 Sep 2018 | *Discuss Tweet

It is not impossible to claim unregistered land and abandoned property in the UK but it will take some research and time. There is a legal process that must be followed when claiming unregistered land and the many thousands of abandoned properties in the UK.

Claiming Land and Property in the UK

It's doubtful that the UK is littered with unclaimed land and property. But land or property that is unregistered can be claimed by UK citizens and the first step will be actually locating the unregistered land or property. Tracking down unclaimed land and property is known as targeting. The next step will be to check with the UK Land Registry to ensure that the targeting land or property is unregistered. The Land Registry is available for inspection and should give information on the targeted land or property.

What Constitutes Unclaimed Land and Property?

Land that has being lying empty or vacant for years may actually be available to be claimed. This can also be true of derelict and abandoned properties. A postal code of the unclaimed land or property will required by the Land Registry. A search of the property or land through the Land Registry will come with a small fee. But simply because a property or plot of land is unregistered or looks abandoned does not mean that someone does not own it. There can be legal consequences for anyone who decides to simply occupy an abandoned plot of land or property

Claiming Unregistered Land in the UK

Claiming unregistered property or land is not a simple process. In order to claim abandoned land a person must first have taken possession of the land. This means erecting fences around the land and occupying it for a certain period of time, this is known as adverse possession. The adverse possession period is 10 years for registered land and 12 years for unregistered land. The person must also be able to prove that they have been in adverse possession for this amount of time. Only then will they be able to register with the Land Registry.

Searching Out Unclaimed Land or Property

Tracing or targeting unclaimed land or property may be one of the most difficult aspects. In most cases it will involve simply searching in person around a city or town. If land does look abandoned or a property looks old and vacant then it may be unregistered. There are usually properties that look as if they have been sitting vacant for many years. But this does not mean that the property is unregistered; this is the reason that the Land Registry must be used to access information on the property or land.

Spotting Unclaimed UK Property

There are a few signs that may help when trying to find abandoned property. These signs are not definite proof that the property is abandoned but can be a guide before checking with the land registry. Signs to look out for will include:

Boarded up windows and doors

Gardens that are unkempt and overgrown

The property has been uninhabited for many years and neighbours are unaware of tenants living there

The garden is often used for people tipping rubbish

The property is in great need of repair

There have been previous reports of squatters in the abandoned property

Vermin can be seen in the property gardens

Squatters Rights to Legally Claim Property

Squatting in abandoned properties has a long tradition in the UK. Squatting in England and Wales is not illegal although it is unlawful under civil law, and is illegal in Scotland. Squatters can actually become the legal occupiers, and in some cases owners, of abandoned properties in the UK. Squatting simply means entering an abandoned property and squatters do have rights once inside a property. The police cannot evict squatters from an abandoned property as it is a civil matter and squatters are provided with protection by law. Again, details of ownership of the property can be found through the Land Registry.

The internet has become rife with advertisements that claim to be able to show people the easy way to claim unregistered land that does not belong to anyone. Many of these advertisements will of course come with a fee to gain this knowledge. This information is widely available through the Land Registry. A detailed fact sheet on the steps required is available as well as information on the various false claims made in these advertisements. Checking with a local Land Registry will be beneficial in order to become aware of the rules and regulations that apply to unclaimed land and property.

The big day has come and gone, and now we look back to see how each team did in the NHL draft. Look, we know that it is way too soon to evaluate a draft and that the true evaluation will be seen four or five years from now. However, we don't want to wait, instead we follow our yearly tradition and do our draft grades now.

LWOS 2017 NHL Draft Grades

Note: We include trades in the grades. The moves for players like Travis Hamonic, Artemi Panarin, Brandon Saad, Derek Stepan, Brayden Schenn, Jordan Eberle, and others from the last week will be included in our draft grades.

A second note: VALUE PICK does NOT mean best player drafted. It means best value. For Example, Nico Hischier was the first player taken in this draft. However he is not our best value pick for the Devils. Why? Because anyone can take the best player with the first overall pick, we are looking for value here, what steal did the team get in the draft that went later than we thought he would? If it was merely an exercise in naming the best player drafted, might as well just name the team's first pick, as that is who their own scouts felt was their best player.

A third note: The links lead back to our scouting reports.

Anaheim Ducks: B

Picks: Maxime Comtois, Antoine Morand, Jack Badini, Kyle Olson, Olle Eriksson-Ek

Best Value: Comtois

The Ducks got very good value when they drafted Comtois. He was once seen as a top five pick, but had a disappointing draft season. The thing with Comtois is that he started the season at wing and did not produce much. In December he was shifted back to centre and had good numbers. Antoine Morand is small but very skilled. He is playing centre now, but may end up as a winger going forward.

Badini was passed over for the draft last year. While we aren't surprised that he was drafted, 91 seemed a bit early and a bit of a reach. Olson is another smaller player with skill. He plays like a buzz-saw though, as Olson is not afraid to mix things up in the corners or in front of the net. He also is talented enough to put up points. Eriksson-Ek gives the Ducks a nice goalie project to work with. He is the brother of Wild prospect Joel Eriksson Ek.

Arizona Coyotes: B +

Picks: Pierre-Olivier Joseph, Filip Westerlund, MacKenzie Entwistle, Nate Schnarr, Cameron Crotty, Noel Hoefenmayer, Michael Karow, Tyler Steenbergen, Erik Walli-Walterholm

Trades: Acquired Niklas Hjalmarsson, Acquired Derek Stepan and Antti Raanta

Best Value: Hjalmarsson

It was an interesting weekend for the Coyotes. Long-time head coach Dave Tippett was shown the door. This was followed by a slew of trades. The Coyotes got excellent value in picking up Hjalmarsson. He's a solid defensive defenceman. They gave up Connor Murphy, whose contract is nearly as big as Hjalmarsson's. Centre Laurent Dauphin was passed by many on the Coyotes depth chart. They also picked up Stepan and Raanta. Stepan is proven top six centre and Raanta will be the team's new number one goalie. The seventh overall pick and Anthony DeAngelo was a big price. Given the age of the Coyotes team, getting proven talent, and the need to hit to the cap floor, this is decent value. The value in their Saturday trade down with the Flyers was great as well, getting two extra picks while moving nine spots.

The Coyotes also had a boatload of picks. We had Joseph lower than many others did, as we see a player who does a lot of things good, but does not have a standout skill. He could be a solid NHL contributor though, but most gain weight. Westerlund was also taken quite a bit higher than where we had hm as a mid third. These two picks keep them away from an A grade. They got good value later in the draft. Entwistle is",0.0,0.6939925018408316,-1.3,0.0
258882,False,1024,"We have made ourselves a navel-gazing folk, a little like Americans of the 19th century — until we lunged into the world by bravely going after the crumbling Spanish empire. And in truth there is plenty that is worthy of our inward gaze now that unjust foreign wars have dropped out of the repertoire.

But absorption in our many domestic ills is not what we are all about these days. Vigorous scrutiny at home, never an American habit, is not why we do not much look outward. For most of us, the point is to avert our eyes as our claim to leadership in global affairs weakens. As an impatient world wings past in pursuit of a new order, America is befuddled and America flinches.

This is my read of foreign policy in the era of Obama and John Kerry, our most mediocre secretary of state since Condi Rice. Well, since Colin Powell. No, since Madeleine Albright. OK, since Warren Christopher. Let's say since Larry Eagleburger, since ... Alas, there is a reason the State Department is called ""Foggy Bottom.""

It's time to notice that Kerry cannot do much more than run to catch up. In Syria, in Iran, in the Pacific: State has been managing no more than frenetic improvisation since Kerry took office last February. And when Kerry is able to exert American preferences, as in Egypt, he gets it very wrong — invoking the past, ignoring the new century's extraordinary dynamism, reverting to Cold War typology as if it can still be made to apply (and as if it ever did).

Scraping away the pretense, we are the ones crumbling now — not altogether unlike the Spanish when Teddy Roosevelt set America's sights on them. And I think it is terrific.

This is neither cynicism nor declinism nor simple pessimism. I call it ""the optimism of pessimism."" Once we finish our crumbling — and it is exactly like the Spanish in this regard — we will have a chance of getting on in the world constructively, of taking our proper place in history (as opposed to standing, somehow, above it).

It is a long-wave thought, true — ""the work of a generation,"" to borrow from the honorable Edward Snowden. But this is what makes 2013 so singular a passage in the running tale of U.S. policy abroad. It is hard to see your moment in history — by definition you are in it. But, rare enough, it is easier now than it usually is.

Among Kerry inheritances when he took the chair after Hillary Clinton was the ""pivot to Asia."" The phrase faded quickly, and it was never more than a trumped-up effort to give American diplomacy the appearance of design — ""architecture,"" as the dips like to say. Instantly, Kerry was up to his neck in the quicksands of the Middle East.

Egypt came first. It was hard to detect, not least because of the disgraceful news reporting (or maybe it was the editing), but we witnessed a Washington-sanctioned coup last summer while scarcely noticing it. The instrument was Susan Rice, just then made national security adviser: She put the call through to Cairo, giving the generals the nod.

Mohammed Morsi's fate was exactly the same as Mossadegh's in Iran, 1953 (elected leader, the nation's first, traded for a murderous autocrat) and Arbenz in Guatemala a year later (first elected leader out, military men and 30 years of civil war in). The three had the same flaw by Washington's reckoning: Two social democrats and a moderate Muslim, they all stood outside the arc of American control.

So much for Kerry's dexterity and imagination, as we read about these virtues in the newspapers. The take-home here: We have changed not at all over the past 60 years, and public deception is consistently essential to the proceedings.

We (well, some of us) mourn parts of our past, not least the coups. Bill Clinton, on a half-day visit to Guatemala City during his presidency, actually apologized for the CIA job on Arbenz. In the same way, some of us may someday get around to regretting what we did to the first president Egyptians chose for themselves. But this has to wait until it no longer matters.

And now you see what I mean, perhaps, when I suggest that it is time to recognize that we inhabit our own history.

Next to the same-old in Egypt, Syria and Iran are even more telling of our time. In both cases, we can discern the future arriving.

258501,True,646,"Premier Kathleen Wynne was coy Wednesday when asked by CBC News if she was planning on proroguing the legislature, which the opposition believes could be a way to avoid accountability.

The house is scheduled to sit until June 9 before taking a summer break, resuming Sept. 12, but the majority Liberal government has already passed most of its agenda this session, including enabling legislation for the partial sale of Hydro One, its sexual violence and harassment action plan and changes to electoral boundaries.

There are still two major pieces of legislation — the budget bill and cap-and-trade legislation — that have not yet passed, but are expected to in the near future.

CBC reporter Mike Crawley asked if she was planning on proroguing once those bills get through the legislature.

""There is a lot more work to do in the province, so stay tuned for how we're going to continue to build this province up,"" she replied.

Government House Leader Yasir Naqvi also did not deny that the government is considering prorogation.

""We've got a lot of work ahead of us,"" he said. ""We have a very ambitious legislative agenda. We have some significant bills in front of us and our focus is right now to pass those bills.""

Opposition questions motives

The opposition parties suggested the Liberal government might want to prorogue to avoid question period.

""They're mired in waste, mismanagement and scandal and I think that's the real reason this government wants to run, but it won't be able to hide from the people of Ontario,"" said Progressive Conservative Vic Fedeli.

The government has been on the receiving end of criticism in question period for its partial sale and privatization of Hydro One, and more recently changes in the budget to seniors' drug costs that the opposition says will leave most seniors in the province paying more. Wynne has said she will reconsider the changes.

NDP Leader Andrea Horwath said the government ""has been everything but transparent and open,"" such as ignoring the public outcry to the sale of Hydro One and feedback on budget consultations.

""They are simply deciding that they don't have to account to anyone,"" she said. ""This is the place of accounting. This is the place where the opposition holds the government to account on what people are saying are problems in this province.""

There is also growing speculation Wynne will shuffle her cabinet at some point this year, since she has not made any substantive changes since the 2014 election.

Prorogation can be a standard tool for governments, but former prime minister Stephen Harper sparked vigorous debate after he prorogued in late 2008, when his minority government faced the spectre of being unseated by an opposition coalition.

In October 2012, after increasing criticism over the costly decision to cancel the plants, former premier Dalton McGuinty abruptly announced a plan to resign as premier and prorogued the legislature. It was done to allow for a cooling off period after a bitter contempt of parliament debate erupted in the legislature over his energy minister's refusal to produce all documents related to the plants.",0.49536456491120834,0.6953645649112083,-0.2,0.0
255219,False,1024,"""Magic mushrooms,"" the recreational hallucinogen long associated with music festivals and hippies, may also one day prove to have a powerful pharmaceutical effect for people with treatment-resistant depression.

In a small pilot study at the Center for Neuropsychopharmacology at Imperial College London, more than half of participants who took psilocybin, the active compound in psychedelic mushrooms, showed a marked improvement in their depression symptoms while also demonstrating the compound's safety in a supervised setting.

This is the first clinical trial to use the active chemical compound in so-called ""magic mushrooms"" to treat major depression. If the findings are confirmed in larger studies, it could mean a change in the way we treat depression symptoms in those who don't respond to therapy and traditional medications, like selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors.

What we knew before:

Mushrooms from the genus Psilocybe contain psilocybin, which the human body breaks down into a substance called psilocin. This psychedelic substance then crosses the blood-brain barrier and binds to a specific serotonin receptor known as 5-HT2A, creating a profound alteration of consciousness that has been described as a mystical event, a spiritual journey or simply a ""trip."" Psychedelic compounds in LSD, ayahuasca and mescaline bind to this same receptor.

Human beings have been consuming psychedelic mushrooms for thousands of years because of this effect, but it wasn't until the 1950s that scientists began examining psilocybin's therapeutic properties in earnest.

Previous pilot studies have shown that psilocybin could be a promising new way to treat mental health symptoms like anxiety, obsessive-compulsive behavior and addiction. Those worried about the compound's effects on mental health needn't worry: Research shows that lifetime use of psychedelics like psilocybin is not an independent risk factor for mental health problems.

Beyond binding with the 5-HT2A receptor, scientists don't really understand the chemical process that leads to this psychedelic experience. It's even less clear how having a mystical experience might produce long-term mental health benefits, but there are at least two theories, according to Dr. Stephen Ross, director of the Psychedelic Research Group at NYU Langone Medical Center. He was not involved in the study, but reviewed it.

In the first theory, the memory of the ""trip"" -- which can be a profound and extremely meaningful experience -- could have a strong psychological effect on people, lifting their moods for months at a time. Alternatively, there may be a biological explanation: It's possible the binding of psilocin to the serotonin receptor sets off a cascade of yet-unknown chemical reactions that persist for weeks or months.

The study details:

Six men and six women with chronic, treatment-resistant, moderate to severe major depression consented to take two different doses of psilocybin (10 mg and 25 mg), separated by one week. There was no control group, and the participants and in what's called an ""open label trial,"" the investigators all knew that they were either taking or administering psilocybin.

During the dosing sessions, participants relaxed on a bed in a room with dim lighting and listened to music through earphones. Supervisors monitored their blood pressure, heart rate and the psychoactive effects of the compound intermittently for up to six hours after they took the pills, while psychiatrists offered support but mostly let patients have their own ""inner journey,"" as the study put it, without interruptions.

None of the participants experienced serious or unexpected negative side effects that required medical intervention from the dosing, though some reported mild anxiety, confusion, nausea or headache. The psychedelic effects peaked about two to three hours after dosing and then became negligible after about six hours.

Most significantly, eight of the 12 patients responded extremely well to the psilocybin, meeting the criteria for remission from depression one week after the two treatments. After three months, five of them remained in remission, while another two continued to show improvement in their depression symptoms compared to baseline. Overall, all 12 patients showed at least some improvement in their symptoms for up to three weeks after the dose.

The results seem promising, but there are some caveats. The overall positive response to the dosing treatment could in part be chalked up to the fact that the participants actively sought out the psilocybin trial and were probably expecting the medicine to work on some level, creating a bias in favor of the intervention. Indeed, five of the participants had already tried psilocybin at least once -- one just six months before the experiment, others ranging from 14 to 48 years prior.

This past experience with a drug and its presumed positive effects could increase suggestibility and expectancy in people, which could affect the results. Double-blind trials in which neither patient nor therapist knows which intervention they received or administered, as well as the inclusion of a control group, could address these issues in",0.8324987169068592,0.8324987169068592,0.0,0.0
256273,True,501,"On-site verifications last year at GVK Biosciences showed irregularities ""in each and every one of the nine trials inspected,"" the European Medicines Agency said in a May report (AFP Photo/Miguel Medina)

European Union nations have until August 20 to suspend the sale of some 700 generic drugs made in India, the EU's executive confirmed on Monday.

The European Commission took the action after an Indian firm contracted by drug companies to test the medications was found to have manipulated data.

On-site verifications last year at GVK Biosciences showed irregularities ""in each and every one of the nine trials inspected,"" the European Medicines Agency said in a May report recommending the suspension.

The broad scope of the problems, which stretched back years, ""highlights critical deficiencies in the quality system in place at GVK Bio's clinic in Hyderabad,"" the EMA said.

The company tests for ""bio-equivalence,"" to see if the generic versions of drugs are identical in impact to the original.

Commission officials were quick to say that there was no reason to suspect the drugs -- including some brands of common pain relievers such as ibuprofen -- had caused any health problems, or that suspending sales would create shortages.

""There is no evidence of harm or lack of effectiveness,"" a spokesman said.

Removing the medications from shelves ""has been important both for ensuring patient safety and for retaining the confidence in the EU marketing authorisation system,"" he added.

Several European nations -- including France, Germany, Belgium and Luxembourg -- did not wait for the EU to act, blocking sales in December or earlier this year.

A few of the medications covered by the suspension have already been reauthorized based on data from other inspection centres.

The decision in Brussels was published on July 20, and specified that EU members had one month to comply.

Countries that declare a particular drug to be ""critical"" can take up to 24 months to implement the measure, the Commission said.

Specifically, GVK Bio was found to have manipulated electrocardiograms (ECGs).

""Even if ECGs do not provide the most essential data for testing bio-equivalence, GVK did not respect good practices,"" noted Francois Hebert, deputy head of France's National Agency for Medicines and Health Products Safety, which carried out the inspections.",0.40355684576279205,0.8035568457627921,-0.4,0.0
255799,True,631,"Some hold with the theory that the development of an embryo shows the stages of evolution. In other words, what first develops is fishlike, and then like a small mammal, and then like a lemur or ape, and then something we would recognize as human. Very early embryos have what look like little gill slits in the beginning of their development. At about four weeks, embryos have a little tail. At around six to twelve weeks, the white blood cells dissolve the tail, and the fetus develops into an average, tail-less baby... most of the time, at least. Every now and again, we get a little extra bit of baby, in the form of a vestigial tail.

Not all things that look like tails - protrusions from the tailbone - actually are what doctors consider ""true"" tails. There are a number of growths or cysts that can form right on the tip of the tailbone. Some of the more unpleasant options are large tumors, elongation of the existing vertebrae, and even parasitic twin tissue. (A parasitic twin is not a fully-formed twin, but the product of another fertilized egg that somehow became fused with the embryo and never developed into a full human being.) True tails form when the white blood cells, for whatever reason, don't absorb all the tissue that formed during embryonic development. These babies carry the marks of humans earliest ancestors.

Advertisement

Because there are only between 20 and 30 cases of ""true"" vestigial tails since the late 1800s, there is some controversy about what such a tail contains. Some early accounts say that there are sometimes extra vertebrae in such tails. No modern tails have been found to have any bone tissue. They're mostly skin with fat, connective tissue, nerves, and muscle tissue. They can be just a stub, but some babies can be born with tails 13 centimeters long. The tails aren't strictly useless inert structures. Because they have muscle tissue inside, they can actually be twitched back and forth, or even contracted into curves. These days babies don't have their tails long enough to gain a lot of muscle control over them. Removing them is a simple operation, usually done not long after birth.

What remains are questions of why these tails grow in the first place. They're rare enough that researchers aren't left with many clues. Researchers have, for the most part, ruled out family history - which throws the science of the X-Files episode I got the top image from right out the window. The tails are associated with spina bifida, a dangerous condition in which the canals of the spinal cord don't entire close before birth, but they are often present without the disorder. And for some reason they're twice in common in males as they are in females. In the end, no one knows why some babies just develop tails. (Besides, gills are much more practical.)

After he was convicted, the Virginia man became an FBI informant. Once released from prison, he joined a D.C.-area think tank focused on studying extremism, saying he hoped to ""make amends"" through his work.

But Morton, now 38, again faces legal troubles after being arrested and accused of bringing cocaine to meet a prostitute. He is due in court next week and could return to prison.

Morton is no longer working as a research fellow at George Washington University's Program on Extremism, a spokesman confirmed.

Morton was once deemed by federal prosecutors as dangerous to ""the very freedoms on which our society is based."" But even before leaving prison, he has said in an interview, he began working undercover on counterterrorism operations. He was released in 2015 after serving less than a third of his 11½ -year prison sentence and hired by GWU the following year.

According to court documents, Morton was arrested on Dec. 28 in a sting operation by Fairfax police. He answered an ad on Backpage.com for a prostitute, police said. When he showed up at the Governor House Inn & Suites in Falls Church, he was arrested. Police say they found cocaine and a glass pipe in his pack of Marlboro cigarettes. In his car, they said they found another device for smoking crack cocaine. He is charged with possession with manufacturing a controlled substance and residing in a bawdy place.

[The feds billed him as a threat to American freedom. Now they're paying him for help.]

Morton could not be reached for comment, and his lawyer did not return a request for comment. He is scheduled to appear in federal court in Alexandria on Tuesday and in Fairfax County court on April 19.

Morton's violent exhortations on the Revolution Muslim website were blamed for inspiring Colleen LaRose, who tried to kill a Swedish cartoonist, and Jose Pimentel, who plotted a New York City bombing, among others. Morton pleaded guilty in 2012 to conspiring to solicit murder, making threatening communications and using the Internet to place others in fear.

In an interview last fall with the Center for Strategic and International Studies, Morton said that after his plea and while in prison, he began doing work for federal agents. According to court documents and a defense attorney involved, after his release Morton was paid by the FBI to help build a case against a supporter of the Islamic State.

[George Washington University hires a former al-Qaeda recruiter]

The FBI also relied on Morton to help demystify the radicalization process, and he took on a similar role at GWU.

In a 2016 interview with The Washington Post, Morton said he hoped that work would give him ""a bit of an ability to make amends.""

He explained how what he described as a traumatic childhood and substance abuse issues left him alienated, searching for a personal transformation and a countercultural worldview. He said he found it first by reading ""The Autobiography of Malcolm X"" during a brief jail stint at age 20. During a second incarceration, Morton converted to Islam.

A fellow prisoner told him a war was coming between Muslims and non-Muslims, and he took up that cause, he told CSIS, fusing extremist politics to his new religious fervor. After his release, even as he graduated from Metropolitan College of New York and earned a master's degree in international affairs from Columbia University in 2008, Morton associated with violent ideologues and became one himself.

Poverty, Water, Animals: On Charity and the Why

A good friend and I were talking about money, charity and volunteering one day and he expressed an opinion that took me aback.

We're so often in agreement given our remarkably similar backgrounds, we put ourselves through school, supported our families from a young age, worked really hard for a long time to get where we are, that I struggled to understand why he was against volunteering and charity.

While I feel that I worked really hard to get here, I didn't get here without help; he feels that he worked really hard to get here and doesn't feel that he got any help so he doesn't feel he should give back to the community at large. Granted, we didn't travel the exact same path but it's hard for me to fathom overlooking the small kindnesses of strangers, like the support from a guidance counselor or a colleague who lobbied for your job security. These are the kinds of things that, though small, add up. They make a difference.

Pat Rothfuss, one of my favorite writers and a stand-up kind of guy, explained it far better than I managed that day:

The simple truth is, Jason, at this point in my life, I have enough money to live comfortably. And in my opinion, if you have enough money to live comfortably and you keep trying to get more and more and more money… well… it's kind of an asshole thing to do. It's like this: if you have one piece of cake, and you eat it, that's fine. If you have two pieces of cake, you should probably share some with a friend. But maybe not. Occasionally we could all use two pieces of cake. But if you have a whole cake, and you eat *all* of it, that's not very cool. It's not just selfish, it's kinda sick and unhealthy.

[…]

That's why I do all the charity work. Because the world isn't as good as I want it to be.

I don't have a better explanation than that for why I felt compelled to help those who have less. ""The world isn't as good as I want it to be"", so, let's do something about that.

I don't belong to the ""have too many cakes"" camp, particularly since I still support two adult dependents who aren't my children, but while I aim to become that kind of wealthy someday, I don't need to be that wealthy to want to make a difference. I can't save any one person but sometimes a helping hand is all you need, sometimes it gives you enough hope to scrape yourself off the floor and keep going.

And that's why I still give. Even though I'm all about personal responsibility and bootstrapping, I remember when a kind gesture was enough to help me do another job, fight another day.

PiC and I get an annual spending allowance out of our shared budget. This is purely for us to spend, however we want, that has nothing to do with necessities which are covered. It's not much, but it's not little either.

I usually hoard mine (SMAAUUGGGG) but this year, I'm making a conscious effort to give between 10-20% to meaningful charities.

Pat Rothfuss's Worldbuilders was one: This was a massive fundraising drive to donate to Heifer International. They do good work, without much waste, and helping people make their own livelihood resonates with me.

Nathan Fillion and his Clean Water campaign for his birthday is another. I love my Captain and I love clean water for people. I remember, growing up, hearing the stories of how the people in our villages had to carry their water, in buckets, up from the streams. Backbreaking work for survival.

Last, and most dear to my heart, the Humane Society & Rescue Organization where we adopted Doggle. Rescuing animals: FTW!

Also, as always, I'll be collecting things that are in good shape but we really don't need anymore and donating them to charity that can use them: homeless and battered women/children's shelters.

Which side of the fence do you stand on? What are your thoughts on the subject?

If you liked this post and found value in it, I'd appreciate your pin and shares.",0.0,0.7459553571917662,-0.7000000000000001,-0.1
255574,True,559,"Huge news on the coal export front just now. As Scott Learn at The Oregonian reports, ""Kinder Morgan drops plan to build coal export terminal at Port of St. Helens industrial park.""

Kinder Morgan had been planning to export as much as 30 million tons of coal each year on the Columbia River from a site near Clatskanie, Oregon, but their plans ran into a buzz saw of opposition from local communities, environmental and health advocates, and even nearby industrial users. This morning they announced that they are officially abandoning their plans to build a coal terminal at Port Westward.

Sightline's research was instrumental in the debate. We published extensive documentation of Kinder Morgan's problems with coal dust at their terminals, as well as the company's lengthy rap sheet of fraud, illegal dumping, and lax safety. A month after we published our research, the utility PGE announced that it would not sublease its land at Port Westward to Kinder Morgan out of concern that the spread of coal dust would damage its gas turbines. Since then, the firm has struggled to configure its plans, but local opposition continued to mount while prices in Asia weakened.

Today's news amounts to a huge victory for the Power Past Coal campaign. Of the six coal export terminals originally planned for the Northwest, three have now been withdrawn, in large part owing to an enormous backlash to the plans.

Predictably, Kinder Morgan is trying to downplay the role of coal export opponents in thwarting the company's plans:

Kinder Morgan's Allen Fore attributed the decision not to seek permits for a coal export terminal to site logistics at the Port of St. Helens industrial park, not the controversy over coal. ""We looked at multiple options and different footprints, but we couldn't find one compatible with the facility we wanted to construct,"" Fore said.

Yet the firm's statement is revealing. Kinder Morgan had a specific project design that they presented to the public. After PGE rejected the plan—out of very justifiable objection to Kinder Morgan's inability to contain coal dust—it had to go back to the drawing board. Having lost the element of surprise, they were met with opposition at every turn.

Kinder Morgan says, cryptically, that they are, ""still looking for coal export sites in the Northwest,"" though they won't name specific sites.

Bernie and Bonnie were created by then-team vice president Dick Hackett as part of an effort to create a lively atmosphere at County Stadium, which also included hiring organist Frank Charles to play a Wurlitzer during the games. As Hackett remembers it, Bernie and Bonnie were added over the objections of team owner Bud Selig.

Bonnie was noted mainly for her colorful antics during the seventh-inning stretch. As the grounds crew swept the infield, Bonnie wielded her signature broom, sweeping off each base in turn. After sweeping third base, she would playfully swat the opposing team's third-base coach on the backside with her broom, following it up with a kiss on his cheek.

Bonnie was discontinued after the 1979 season, although no clear reason has ever been given for her ""firing"". Bernie Brewer was discontinued as a mascot in 1984, although he was brought back as a costumed mascot in 1993, complete with full-body costume and large foam head. Bonnie Brewer returned as part of the nostalgia-heavy final home stand at County Stadium, September 18-28, 2000.",0.6880207081098498,0.7880207081098498,-0.1,0.0

Are you personally offended that everyone assumes your friend is carried garbage? You shouldn't be. It's a fairly normal assumption to make when one is clearly carried.

He may be a great Mercy. GM level even. But for his rank, since it was gained through an exploitation of the system, he wouldn't survive in a solo queue against top 500s. Thus, boosted garbage compared to those of similar (and well earned) rank. This is certainly an apt discussion to have when someone 'jokingly' brags about their rank, since they don't even deserve to be there in the first place. In any case, what do you even care about people getting 'off topic' if it was 'all a meme bro'?

Plus, that just gives us more insight into his character -- Bragging about his #1 rank to 'get people mad', when he knowingly cheated his way to that spot, makes him a pretty garbage person too. It doesn't matter if it's a 'meme' or a 'troll' (which is frankly unbelievably pathetic 12 year old behavior, geez) -- the discussion got real pretty quick when he was found out for his methods and now ya'll just can't handle being called out for the trash that you are now.

Greenville, North Carolina (CNN) – At a Labor Day rally, Republican vice presidential hopeful Rep. Paul Ryan raised the question 'are you better off' and compared President Barack Obama to one-term President Jimmy Carter.

""You see the president has no record to run on. In fact, every president since the Great Depression who asked Americans to send them into a second term could say that you are better off today than you were four years ago, except for Jimmy Carter and for President Barack Obama,"" said Ryan.

- Check out the CNN Electoral Map and Calculator and game out your own strategy for November.

The 1980 presidential race was largely defined by that question after Republican Ronald Reagan posed it rhetorically at the end of his only debate with Democratic incumbent Carter.

Republican running mates Mitt Romney and Ryan are hammering that same message after prominent Democratic surrogates couldn't give a definitive ""yes"" to the question in various television appearances over the weekend. On Monday Democrats seemed more certain, though still attempted to balance touting improving economic data with the tough realities that many Americans still face.

The seven-term Wisconsin congressman delivered the GOP's counterattack at a rally before thousands of people at East Carolina University, located nearly 250 miles from Charlotte where the Democratic National Convention is being held.

""In 1980, under Jimmy Carter, 330,000 businesses filed for bankruptcy. Last year, under President Obama's failed leadership, 1.4 million businesses filed for bankruptcy,"" Paul said. ""Take a look at people who are having a hard time making their mortgage payments, 77,000 delinquent mortgages by the time Jimmy Carter left office. Under President Obama 3 million.""

Ryan's campaign later clarified that he was mentioning total bankruptcy filings, not only business filings.

He continued, ""So when you take a look at what we are going to hear in Charlotte today, the president can say a lot of things and he will, but he can't tell you that you are better off. Simply put, the Jimmy Carter years look like the good old days compared to where we are right now.""

Obama's re-election team defended the president's record and said their GOP challenger was ""waxing nostalgic about how things were three decades ago"" with the comparisons to Carter.

""The truth is that under the President's leadership, we've gone from losing 800,000 jobs a month to adding 4.5 million jobs over the last 29 months of private sector job growth,"" Obama campaign spokesman Danny Kanner said in a statement.

Republicans have long sought to portray Obama as unqualified to the challenge of fixing America's ailing economy, and much of last week's Republican National Convention was spent attacking Obama's record on jobs creation.

Romney's campaign said the theme would continue through the week, leading up to Obama's acceptance of the Democratic presidential nomination on Thursday.

A new poll indicates Romney has a slight advantage in North Carolina. Obama narrowly won the battleground state four years ago. He was the first Democrat to carry the Tar Heel state in a presidential election since 1976.

""Your country needs your help. Eastern North Carolina is so crucial and important to this,"" Ryan told hundreds in one of two overflow crowds on Monday. ""This election is one of the most defining election of our lifetimes, no matter what generation you come from.""

255501,True,794,"OTTAWA — The Ontario government is disputing NDP Leader Tom Mulcair's assertion that the country's largest province supports his plan to create one million $15-a-day child-care spaces.

Ontario's education minister, Liz Sandals, says the province welcomes new investments and interest from ""all federal partners"" on child care.

But she said Mulcair has not provided sufficient details of his plan — which would require provinces to pick up 40 per cent of the tab — to determine whether Ontario would be prepared to buy in.

The NDP is proposing to create one million child-care spaces over eight years that would be accessible to parents for $15 a day, regardless of income. The federal government would pick up 60 per cent of the cost, which the NDP estimates would cost the federal treasury $5 billion annually once fully implemented.

The NDP says Manitoba, British Columbia and New Brunswick have signalled a willingness to negotiate a shared-cost child-care program.

However, Sandals said Ontario has already spent billions on child care and full-day kindergarten and those investments would have to be recognized ""in full"" in any national program requiring matching provincial funds.

If Ontario and other provinces were to insist that money already being spent on child care be counted as part of their matching share of a national program, that could significantly reduce the number of new spaces Mulcair is promising to create.

Ontario's view of the NDP child-care proposal was thrown into question Saturday after Liberal MP John McCallum predicted Mulcair's plan will never materialize because provinces don't have the money to contribute their share of the program, which he pegged at $3.3 billion.

""Where are the provinces going to come up with $3.3 billion? I come from Ontario. Ontario has a significant deficit. Ontario would have to come up with a billion dollars-plus per year,"" McCallum told a news conference.

""If the provinces don't come up with the money, there won't be any child-care spaces.""

Wynne, who has been actively campaigning for Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau in the federal campaign, signed onto a letter from all premiers to Prime Minister Stephen Harper just last month, in which the provincial leaders called for federal ""supports to families such as affordable, quality childcare.""

Moreover, Wynne's Liberals supported an NDP motion in the Ontario legislature last fall calling on the province to ""partner with the federal government to ensure every parent in Ontario has access to child care at a cost of no more than $15 a day per child.""

But Sandals said that motion included no specific details on how such a program would be funded.

She said Ontario has gone from spending $530 million annually on child care to more than $1 billion while creating 130,000 new daycare spaces. Moreover, she said 470,000 children are benefiting from the provincial government's introduction of full-day kindergarten, without which every one of those children would need child care.

""We expect that any funding for child care that requires provincial matching would recognize these commitments in full,"" Sandals said.

Asked whether Ontario might refuse to ante up any further funding on the basis that its existing investments already amount to its 40 per cent share of the NDP's proposed program, Sandals said: ""I cannot speak to specifics that haven't been shared in the NDP proposal.""

However, Mulcair might have no choice but to give Ontario, or any other province, its share of federal funding whether or not it puts up an additional dime of its own.

Under the NDP's 10-year-old policy on Quebec, known as the Sherbrooke declaration, the party has adopted the principle that provinces should be allowed to opt out of federal programs in areas of provincial jurisdiction — such as day care — with full compensation.",0.7744109210337677,0.7744109210337677,0.0,0.0
256573,True,338,"Syracuse, N.Y. — Basketball coaches, prospects and their parents often talk growth potential when projecting into the performance future.

The website Draftexpress.com has gathered the measurements of 56 prospects who participated in the training camps of USA Basketball's U17 and U18 teams and posted them on their site. The interesting thing is that because plenty of these players have a history with USA Basketball, it's possible to watch their incremental growth (and yes, project whether they could get even bigger).

Several Syracuse recruits and prospects are on that list. Here's a breakdown:

The information on Malachi Richardson is curious. According to the posted measurements, he's two inches shorter than he was last year. Clearly, some sort of mistake has been made along the way. USA Basketball supposedly measured him at 6-foot-3 1/4 in shoes; he also allegedly has a 7-foot wingspan. Richardson has gained six pounds over the summer.

Tyler Lydon has grown almost an inch from last year (to 6-8.75 without shoes). He's gained 13 pounds since last summer (to a still-slender 194).

Thomas Bryant measured 6-9 and weighed 241 pounds, 20 pounds more than he weighed in the spring. He had a 7-foot-5.5 wingspan.

You don't know him. And that suits him just fine. He's an Irishman who has worked with many of the biggest teams in global sport as well as the US Army's Special Forces. He's also the man Ronan O'Gara credits with helping him operate at the highest level for so long, but Fergus Connolly chooses to remain largely anonymous.

A few weeks ago, the San Francisco 49ers announced, with much fanfare, that they had signed quarter-back Colin Kaepernick on a deal to remain with the team worth a staggering $126m (92m euro). Two days earlier, they quietly acquired the services of the Monaghan man.

In putting him on a deal that makes him one of the top-paid players in the league, the 49ers had effectively entrusted Kaepernick with guiding them to the Superbowl title. And by securing Connolly, one of the world's leading authorities on human performance, recovery and lengthening careers, they underpinned their investment.

He could have ended up anywhere, but one of the NFL's best-known franchises won the race for his services by creating a new position for the former Scotstown footballer when they named him as their director of elite performance.

If his name rings a bell it's probably because he granted a rare interview the week after he helped Dublin win last year's All-Ireland.

Other than that, word of mouth has been his currency. Jim Gavin had been able to acquire Connolly's services through unfortunate circumstances. His mother had been ill and he needed to be close to home.

While he was here, he helped introduce a tactical and training programme as Dublin won their All-Ireland in style and, crucially, avoiding soft tissue injuries right up to the final. With Connolly's mother happily recovered, the race for his services was back on and eventually concluded with this month's move to California.

His story, that takes him from a north Monaghan parish steeped in Gaelic football to working with some of the world's best athletes, is as unconventional as it is remarkable.

He's just 37, but it's not long since Connolly was on track for the more mundane existence as a woodwork teacher. He kept learning, though, starting at the bottom with a diploma in Manual Therapy and working his way up to a PhD, along with a host of other courses in between.

He knocked down a few doors, but word quickly spread. Through his contacts, he has built up one of the most impressive CVs in his field.

He first popped up here in 2008 when John McCloskey recommended him to the Derry footballers. At that stage, Connolly was already making waves cross channel, working with Bolton Wanderers, but he threw in his lot with the Ulster men. Derry would win their first league title since 2000 that spring. He'd also work with Bernard Dunne on his way to the world title. Dunne namechecked him regularly, but still Connolly kept his head down and profile low.

However, in the world of sports science, he was already big news. Before the 49ers, he had worked at the top level in all of the major field sports in the world. His client list read like a who's who of world sport and included the Welsh Rugby Union, Liverpool, Manchester United, Jacksonville Jaguars and the New York Knicks to name but a few. He also worked in the NHL.

In Australia, there were whisperings he would join AFL side Collingwood, while he was also linked with a switch to the Wallabies with Robbie Deans ahead of the Lions tour last year.

Dubbed 'the unconventional fixer' for his unique all-encompassing approach to maximising performance, the AFL seconded Connolly to run the rule over their newly established expansion franchise, Greater Western Sydney Giants. The Giants had unexpectedly lost their high performance director and having effectively sent an entire team of first-round draft picks to the new club to help get them off the ground, the AFL needed to protect their investment and sent Connolly in.

Closer to home, he helped Munster and Bryce Cavanagh set up their 'Maldini Project', which helped extend the careers of the team that had helped establish the province as a major force in European rugby.

O'Gara is still in touch with Connolly and believes he helped him avoid the ""slow death"" that befalls so many other stars raging against the dying embers of their careers.

255881,True,700,"CASTELNUOVO DI PORTO, Italy (AP) — Pope Francis washed and kissed the feet of Muslim, Orthodox, Hindu and Catholic refugees Thursday, declaring them children of the same God, in a gesture of welcome and brotherhood at a time when anti-Muslim and anti-immigrant sentiment has spiked following the Brussels attacks.

Francis denounced the carnage as a ""gesture of war"" carried out by blood-thirsty people beholden to the weapons industry during an Easter Week Mass with asylum seekers at the shelter in Castelnuovo di Porto, outside Rome.

The Holy Thursday rite re-enacts the foot-washing ritual Jesus performed on his apostles before being crucified, and is meant as a gesture of service.

Francis contrasted that gesture with the ""gesture of destruction"" carried out by the Brussels attackers, saying they wanted to destroy the brotherhood of humanity represented by the migrants.

""We have different cultures and religions, but we are brothers and we want to live in peace,"" Francis said in his homily, delivered off-the-cuff in the windy courtyard of the center.

Several of the migrants then wept as Francis knelt before them, poured holy water from a brass pitcher over their feet, wiped them clean and kissed them.

Francis was greeted with a banner reading ""Welcome"" in a variety of languages as he walked down a makeshift aisle to celebrate the outdoor Mass. But only a fraction of the 892 asylum seekers living at the shelter attended, and many of the seats were left empty. Those who came out, though, received a personal greeting: At the end of the Mass, Francis greeted each refugee, one by one, posing for selfies and accepting notes as he moved down the rows.

Vatican rules had long called for only men to participate in the ritual, and past popes and many priests traditionally performed it on 12 Catholic men, recalling Jesus' 12 apostles and further cementing the doctrine of an all-male priesthood.

Francis shocked many Catholics within weeks of his 2013 election by performing the ritual on women and Muslims at a juvenile detention center. After years of violating the rules outright, Francis in January changed the regulations to explicitly allow women and girls to participate.

The Vatican said Thursday that four women and eight men took part. The women included an Italian Catholic who works at the center and three Eritrean Coptic Christian migrants. The men included four Catholics from Nigeria, three Muslims from Mali, Syria and Pakistan and a Hindu man from India.

The Vatican's new norms said anyone from the ""people of God"" could be chosen to participate in the ceremony. While the phrase ""people of God"" usually refers to baptized Christians, the decree also said that pastors should instruct ""both the chosen faithful and others so that they may participate in the rite consciously, actively and fruitfully,"" suggesting that the rite could be open to non-Catholics as well.

Francis seemed to define ""people of God"" as open-ended.

""All of us, together: Muslims, Hindi, Catholics, Copts, Evangelicals. But brothers, children of the same God,"" he said. ""We want to live in peace, integrated.""

One exception is Karleen's Uptown Fare, where Hollywood types get the snub.

For the 10-day run of the festival, which starts Thursday, Jan. 17, owner Karleen Reilly hangs a large banner outside her soup-and-sandwich shop at the top of Main Street that reads ""locals only club."" She also stations a doorman at the main entrance who politely turns away anyone from out of town.

""I have a password, but I pretty much know all the locals"" said the no-nonsense Reilly. ""Besides, you can tell a Sundancer a mile away. It's pretty obvious.""

This will be the fifth year that Reilly has made residents royalty. Her decision to go rogue is a way to thank the regular diners who support her the rest of the year. ""I've had some devoted customers who have been coming for a long time,"" she said. ""I think they appreciate it.""

She also does it to help film festival volunteers, most of whom call Utah home. ""They only have a certain amount of time to get lunch,"" she said. ""They know they can run in here and get a quick meal in 15 or 20 minutes.""

It hasn't always been this way. Years ago, when Reilly — and the festival — were just starting out, everyone was welcome in the tiny shop at 227 S. Main, next to the Treasure Mountain Inn. Reilly proudly points to the photographs of actors Nick Nolte, Minnie Driver, Billy Bush, Scott Wolf and others who came in and enjoyed her food.

But a few years ago, the festival outgrew her restaurant, which only seats about 20 people. ""They would camp out in here with their computers, order two cups of coffee and stay four hours,"" Reilly said. ""I don't want that or need that.""

She could have closed down for the festival, but that's not her style. Of course, Reilly's not heartless as some rumors suggest. ""I don't turn away pregnant women and children,"" she said. ""And skiers are always welcome.""

A long-time Park City resident, Reilly opened Uptown Fare about 13 years ago after spending more than a decade as a caterer. ""I had always thought about opening a place,"" she said, ""and then one day I heard Oprah talking about how if you do what you love, you will do well.""

Today, she operates the restaurant with the help of her daughter, Nivin Lloyd, and employee Beth Falk. Locals are drawn to this hidden gem for its unpretentious atmosphere and menu. Low ceilings, narrow eating spaces and an eclectic mix of donated furniture and thrift-store finds makes it feel like your grandmother's kitchen. There's even a sign that reads ""There will be $5.00 charge for Whining,"" a nice change from the white-tablecloth establishments that fill Park City's Main Street.

Uptown Fare's menu includes several different homemade soups, that rotate with the seasons and Reilly's culinary whims. There also are sandwiches made from fresh roasted meats, salads and baked goods. While customers say it's all delicious, the restaurant is best known for its tomato bisque and turkey/cranberry sandwich.

Every day Reilly carves her way through a whole roasted turkey, which she special orders from North Carolina. When all the meat has been served on sandwiches and salads, the carcass is used to make a variation of turkey soup.

""We get here as often as we can,"" said customer Kellee Shea, during a recent visit with her youngest daughter, Savannah

Shea, wife of 2002 Olympic gold medalist in skeleton Jimmy Shea — whose photo is also on the wall— said the turkey/cranberry sandwich is her favorite. "" I'm usually planning around breakfast to come here and get it for lunch.""

Greg Gaudet is another ski season regular. Last week, he brought in a group of friends to try the food and meet ""the characters who work here."" He tells his guests about the ""locals only"" policy and said he appreciates that the atmosphere doesn't change just because Hollywood decides to drops in for a few days.

""It's a family place,"" he said. ""And everyone that comes in you know.""

New court documents have revealed how prosecutors protected friends of Prince Andrew's paedophile's pal to avoid them being brought to court over child sex abuse charges.

Investigators suspected billionaire Jeffrey Epstein abused 34 underage girls but lawyers failed to charge him or any of his ""co-conspirators"" and instead offered him a secret plea bargain.

In court papers that were previously sealed it has been revealed how prosecutors said they would keep from the judge Epstein's friends who have been accused of being involved in the abuse.

The documents were released as part of the ongoing civil case brought by two alleged victims of Epstein against US federal prosecutors' handling of the financier's conviction.

Lawyers for the women claim the plea deal granting Epstein and any potential co-conspirators immunity from further prosecution violated their clients' rights.

In September 2007, Assistant US Attorney Marie Villafana sent an email to Epstein's lawyer Jay Lefkowitz suggesting prosecutors attempted to keep information about his alleged crimes from judges.

It read: ""I will include our standard language regarding resolving all criminal liability and I will mention 'co-conspirators', but I would prefer not to highlight for the judge all of the other crimes and all of the other persons that we could charge.""

The new paperwork fuels suspicions Epstein's legal team and US prosecutors colluded to ensure the powerful billionaire did not face the most serious charges.

In another email Villafana tells Lefkowitz: ""I wanted to tell you that I have compiled a list of 34 confirmed minors.

""There are six others, whose name we already have, who need to be interviewed by the FBI to confirm whether they were 17 or 18 at the time of their activity with Mr. Epstein.""

Epstein later pleaded guilty to two state charges of soliciting a minor for prostitution and soliciting prostitution, serving 13 months after being sentenced in 2008.

Also within the newly released cache Epstein's lawyers demanded letters to victims informing them their cases were not being pursued were not issued.

Earlier this year one of Epstein's alleged victims accused Prince Andrew and British socialite Ghislaine Maxwell of being involved in the abuse.

Virginia Roberts, who claimed she was the American's sex slave, claimed in courts papers the Duke of York had sex with her in London, New York and on Epstein's private Caribbean island when she was 17 years of age.

The claims were vehemently denied by Buckingham Palace and were removed from US civil court records following a federal judge's ruling in April.

Court papers lodged in Florida accused Andrew of abusing Miss Roberts when she was 17.

Her accusations were part of submissions made by lawyers acting for the now 31-year-old who wanted to join the existing civil lawsuit launched by the two other women.

US District Judge Kenneth Marra refused Roberts permission to join the claim, and said in his written judgement the sex abuse details had no bearing on the lawsuit's goal of reopening the Epstein non-prosecution agreement.

According to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers' official website, kicker Connor Barth will miss the entire season due to a torn Achilles' tendon. Barth suffered the injury while playing in a charity basketball game.

As polarizing a position as it may be, losing their franchise kicker is a damaging blow to Tampa Bay's postseason odds.

The Buccaneers displayed Barth's value last year, signing him to a four-year contract worth $13.2 million. Barth responded by converting 84.8 percent of his field goals and becoming the most accurate kicker in franchise history.

Per Andrew Brandt of ESPN, Tampa Bay hasn't decided what to do with Barth's salary.

With a devastating injury to the part of his body that matters most to his career, it's unclear what this means for Barth's future in Tampa Bay.

What is clear, however, is the Bucs have dreams of reaching the postseason and becoming a contender. They acquired Darrelle Revis, have a star at running back with Doug Martin and work under a head coach, Greg Schiano, with undeniable potential.

Losing a veteran like Barth doesn't offset those strengths, nor does it eliminate Tampa Bay from the postseason—it simply makes their road a little more difficult.

Power, Accuracy and Consistency

During the 2012 NFL regular season, Barth converted 28-of-33 field goal attempts for the Buccaneers. He also made a perfect 39-of-39 extra-point attempts and hit 90.0 percent of his field goals during the fourth quarter.

Most importantly, Barth was able to land kicks from all over the field.

18 of Barth's 28 field goals made were from at least 40 yards away, tying for the league lead in that regard. Six of those field goals were from 50-plus yards, which placed fourth among all kickers.

That type of power and accuracy doesn't grow on trees.

Kickers may be viewed as less-than-prolific players on NFL teams, but Barth gave Tampa Bay confidence that they could walk away with points if they crossed an opponent's 40-yard line. As a part of his 40-plus yard mastery, he converted two field goals from at least 55 yards away, including a 57-yard blast.

If that's not enough, four of his five misses came during a four-week span—during the other 12 weeks, he was 24-of-25.

Lawrence Tynes' Range

Lawrence Tynes is popularly known as one of the heroes from the New York Giants' past two Super Bowl titles. As the Giants' fanbase will unbiasedly tell you, however, Tynes is a streaky kicker who struggles to convert deep attempts.

It's also worth noting that Barth made more kicks from 50-plus yards and out in 2012 than Tynes has in his past four regular seasons combined.

To replace one of the best long-ball kickers in professional football, the Bucs have landed a player with limited range. Tynes certainly has the postseason pedigree, but in terms of contributing when it matters for 16 consecutive games, there's reason to doubt his ability.

Something that wouldn't have been the case with Barth.

Barth has a more powerful leg than Tynes and, as he's progressed as a player, has become more consistent. There's no question which player we'd rather have in the Super Bowl, but right now, Tampa Bay is a young team looking to grow as a unit.

Losing an important member of their roster is a major setback that could expose their youth on offense.

Doug Martin was a Rookie of the Year candidate and Pro Bowl selection during the 2012 regular season. He picked up 1454 yards and 11 touchdowns, carrying the Bucs throughout the season and becoming one of the best red zone players in the NFL.

Martin is also a second-year player that defenses will be game-planning for in ways they never did during his rookie campaign.

If there was a consistent quarterback in front of Martin, this wouldn't be much of an issue. He could still find holes as a runner, catch passes out of the backfield and guide Tampa Bay's offense to postseason-caliber results.

Unfortunately, consistency isn't a word in Josh Freeman's vocabulary.

During the 2012 regular season, Freeman picked up an impressive 4,065 yards and 27 touchdowns. Unfortunately, he also completed just 54.8 percent of his passes, threw 17 interceptions and committed 10 fumbles.

If any team lived by the moniker of ""Take the points when you can get them,"" it would be Tampa Bay.

Their defense is improved, Freeman has upside and Vincent Jackson is an elite receiver. Even with Martin, however, Tampa Bay is a team that trusts their kicker's ability to convert long field goals and maintain momentum",0.5459451950789418,0.7459451950789419,-0.2,0.0

258438,True,308,"Tuesday night, Scott Rabalais of The Advocate in Baton Rouge set the internet ablaze.

Rabalais reported that there are ""strong indications"" that Les Miles is coaching for his job these next two weeks (at Ole Miss tomorrow and vs. Texas A&M next weekend). As we at FootballScoop know quite well, when you write an article like that, you fairly quickly are told by powers in the know that you are right…or wrong.

Rabalais updated things today with a note along those same lines…noting that he was right (according to ""sources with knowledge of the unfolding situation"").

Rabalais notes that there are three major scenarios in play.

LSU wins out – In which case Les is ""clearly safe""; however Rabalais adds that staff changes could be in the offing. LSU loses out – ""There is little chance Miles would be allowed to return"". LSU splits these two games – Many shades of gray. Poker. This could go in any direction and the gloves might come off.

Miles' buyout is $15 million if he is let go prior to January 1, at which time it drops to $12.9 million. Throw in another $2 million for the assistants (per Rabalais) and perhaps another $5 million to secure the new staff…and oh my this would the riskiest move Joe Alleva has ever recommended in his life.

This is one of those ""accessible"" piracy history books in the vein of David Cordingly, Colin Woodard, Marcus Rediker. And it has the same kind of problems as those books. Namely, it can be a little deceptive/suspicious. First of all, I absolutely cannot stand this format of footnotes, where they are not numbered in the text, just like in Woodard's Republic of Pirates. I understand most people probably don't read footnotes, but I do, and it sure gets on my nerves when I go fact-checking in the footnotes and see that a claim is not even LISTED, much less sourced. That makes it very hard for me to trust any information presented to me. So that being said, this book does a much better job when it is working off real evidence--which is to say, the parts of the book about the government officials and politicians, who left enough of a historical paper trail to substantiate Burgess' writing. When he starts talking about the pirates, I have to check out. He leans HEAVY on the General History, which he attributes to Daniel Defoe. This is certainly not unique to Burgess--it seems like practically every piracy author does the same thing. The General History is a book that piracy scholarship really needs to disavow, and it honestly makes me cringe when I see authors relying on it as a source of information, just because they assume their readers will trust it. In a similar vein, it was extremely irritating to find an illustration in the book of Blackbeard fighting Maynard, which Burgess describes as a ""surprisingly accurate"" ""contemporary woodcut"". This despite the fact that Maynard is drawn in a waist-length waistcoat, cutaway coat, long trousers, and BICORN hat, dating this image to something like 100 years after the event it depicts! This image is as contemporary as the General History is trustworthy.


This isn't a bad book, but the topic is broad enough (spanning multiple decades in multiple different colonies) that it gets confusing remembering who is who and why they matter. There are countless governors, lords, customs agents, council members, etc etc etc, who can keep track? Burgess tries to help us with occasional ~novelized~ passages, such as the opening passage about Blackbeard, but I have to admit they kind of annoyed me. I don't need to read half a paragraph describing someone mailing a letter, nor do I want to hear an author presenting his interpreted attribution of emotional experience as fact. (No footnotes...and often not even a qualifier like ""perhaps"" or ""it seems likely that"") And bizarrely, sometimes information is repeated throughout the book...he writes on page 118 that John Hoar commanded a ship called the John and Rebecca, ""named, touchingly, after himself and his wife"". Later on page 208...he writes that John Hoar named a ship the John and Rebecca, ""after himself and his wife"". Did you forget you told us this already? This happens a couple times because the massive scope of the book means that Burgess picks a storyline to follow for a while, but then when he chooses another thread to follow, he has to go back in time a little to catch us up on this overlapping narrative, mixing up the timelines and plots.


Well anyway, this book does have some useful information in it. I was disappointed in some pretty niche ways, but I understand most people probably won't have the same issues that I do.",0.0,0.7378753014932647,-2.3000000000000003,-0.1
259100,True,974,"BALLABGARH: Returning home to a village near Ballabgarh in Haryana, after shopping for Eid at Jama Masjid in Delhi, a family ran into a nightmare on a local train on Thursday evening. For three and a half hours, they were abused, humiliated and assaulted by a mob of 15-20 people that passed communal remarks and accused them of carrying beef in a bag.Finally, a 19-year-old was stabbed to death and another received stab injuries. The GRP at Ballabgarh railway station failed to intervene and stop the assault.The GRP claimed on Friday to have arrested a man and detained a suspect allegedly involved in the attack.Haryana DGP B S Sandhu, however, denied that the incident was the outcome of an argument over beef. ""This was a clash between two groups which resulted in the death of one person. We have already arrested one of the accused. Police teams are investigating and others too will be arrested,"" he told TOI.The youths, from Khandoa village near Ballabgarh, had boarded an EMU at Sadar Bazar around 5.30pm. Junaid, the teenager killed by the mob, and his brothers — Mohsin, Haseem and Moeen — were carrying gifts and food for their family members and had packed them in plastic bags.Haseem (20) said that they had occupied two seats and were playing ludo when the train reached Okhla station. Around 15 to 20 people boarded the Mathura-bound train and asked them to vacate the seats. When they refused, the men abused them with communal remarks.They started calling us names and said we were unpatriotic and anti-nationals and then started hitting us. They were pointing at a packet which had food and saying that we should not be allowed to sit since we were carrying beef,"" said Haseem. They denied they were carrying beef and tried to reason with the men but they became even more aggressive.Moeen (17), Junaid's cousin, said they finally got up, somehow managed to free themselves from the mob and moved to the adjacent coach but the men followed them there, hurling abuses.""We decided to get down at Faridabad station and take another train to Ballabgarh but the men blocked our way and asked the other passengers to prevent us from leaving,"" said Mohsin (18). ""We pleaded with them to let us go but we were caught between two seats. And there was a crowd at the exit."" Scared that they would be attacked again, Mohsin called their brother Shakir, asking him to reach the station with some help.When they tried again to get off at Ballabgarh, a heated argument ensued. Shakir had responded to their call and boarded the train. Some men in the mob now pulled out knives and attacked Junaid when he tried to force his way out. ""He was pinned by four men and stabbed repeatedly till he fell unconscious.When Shakir and Moeen tried to intervene, the men caught Shakir and stabbed him in the throat, chest and hands,"" said Mohsin.He said since the train had started moving, they pulled the chain but it didn't work.Mohsin said everything was happening in plain sight of GRP personnel at Ballabgarh railway station but they refused to help them. ""To save ourselves, we called the police and the emergency response number but there was no response,"" he said.The train reached Asavati station around 9pm where they were pushed out before the train left for Mathura. They were taken to the civil hospital at Palwal by family members who had hired an ambulance from a local hospital.Junaid was declared brought dead. Shakir was referred to AIIMS Trauma Centre where he is said to be critical. Mohseen and Moeen too were admitted to the civil hospital while Haseem was discharged after treatment.The SHO of GRP at Ballabgarh police station, Surat Pal, admitted that they couldn't rescue the four youths due to the crowd at the station. ""One of them, Mohsin, called an ambulance when his brother was stabbed.

258632,False,1024,"As highest quality of care continues not to be the emphasis in the health care debate— let alone be on par with discussions around access, Canadian health systems remain in the spotlight. This time, multiple hospitals in southern Ontario shut their doors to the sickest of babies due to lack of beds for a 10% patient surge compared to the same time period last year.

According to Shawn Whatley, president of Ontario Medical Association, while pleading for increased funding, ""These are our sickest patients. This is a reflection of our whole system. Our system is stretched to max capacity. We're often forced to do more and more with less and less.""

It is reported the Toronto Central Local Health Integration Network (LHIN) insists ""no babies have been turned away as they started using temporary beds for the babies when they got to capacity."" This statement baffles me. In fact, it exemplifies a fundamental lack of understanding of what is required for resuscitation of an extreme premature baby as well as those born with the most serious of health conditions.

Placing a baby in a bassinet that is temporary does not save a life, let alone maintain one. These are infants necessitating neonatal intensive care services. If the appropriate equipment is not provided along with one-to-one staffing to monitor continuous vital signs, apnea (cessation of breathing), potential hypothermia or hypoglycemia (too low blood sugar) among innumerable other challenges that are common occurrences in this population, then what does a crib actually do?

The answer: not provide medical care.

Electrolyte repletion in infants—as well as medications in them and pediatric patients, in general— is based on weight. Each calculation is crucial and must be precise or literally fatal arrhythmias, fluid overload and the like can develop. While they can be quite resilient, newborns with certain congenital disorders requiring timely surgical correction or those with severe lung immaturity demanding basic supplemental oxygen from nasal cannula to mechanical ventilation won't necessarily survive, let alone thrive. Delays in this arena mean the difference in life or death as well as short- and long-term disability.

Again, not doing things correctly from the outset in the medical realm not only places an individual with a disease at a deficit, but it initiates a trajectory that leads to more heroic costly and invasive measures, increased anxiety and suffering, progression of illness, unnecessary adverse effects and poorer ultimate outcomes. Bandaids don't repair ruptured arteries. And, as a policy tenet they yield not only what Ontario is battling, but also the recent struggles of the United Kingdom's National Health Service (NHS).

In More Bad News For Single Payer Health System, I wrote about an NHS recent report generated out of London that paints a grim picture about systemic failings in healthcare of the sickest patients. Citing high mortality rates —more than one in three died— due to sub-standard practices, The National Confidential Enquiry into Patient Outcome and Death. Inspiring Change reveals the sad reality of care quality reduction when resources limit appropriate staffing and equipment supply for ever increasing patient volumes. The care was rated as less than good for every four out of five cases. In this article, I touch upon the much improved survival rates in the United States compared to these populations.

In Rough Week For Government-Run Healthcare, I focus on news from NHS England that the number of people waiting for routine surgery now exceeds 4 million. The highest in a decade. The BBC went on to report ""Other targets missed include the four-hour target in A&E and urgent referrals for cancer care."" Sky News wrote ""Dr Mark Holland, president of the Society for Acute Medicine, said the latest figures were ""shocking"" and represent ""another damning indictment of the crisis we are experiencing in the NHS."" The sentiment further echoed by ""Danny Mortimer, deputy chief executive of the NHS Confederation, which represents health organizations in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, and chief executive of NHS Employers, called the system ""unsustainable.""""

Even childbirth had catastrophic ramifications leading to a reversal of the ""normal"" or ""natural birth"" campaign by the Royal College of Midwives. Infant and maternal morbidity and mortality cannot best be avoided when training is disparate and physician involvement or obstetric care is withheld. See here to learn more about the investigations into unnecessary deaths and the perpetuation of dangerous deliveries.

The picture out of Canada echoes the same recurrent themes:

excessive wait times for countless populations— a monetary, physical, emotional and ethical toll.

poor nurse to patient ratios and improper assignments of appropriately trained personnel

lack of equipment exacerbating rationing of care— who's life is of greater value?

bad patient outcomes

increased ""burnout"" and staff—e.g. nursing, physician— shortages (1)

257677,True,957,"In just 10 years, we may live in a world where there are sensors in the walls of our houses, in our clothes and even in our brains.

Forget thinking about the Internet of Things where your coffee maker and refrigerator are connected. By 2025, we could very well live in a trillion-device world.

[ Stay up to date on tech news with Computerworld's daily newsletters. ]

That's the prediction from Alberto Sangiovanni-Vincentelli, a professor of electrical engineering and computer science at the University of California at Berkeley.

""Smartness can be embedded everywhere,"" said Sangiovanni-Vincentelli. ""The entire environment is going to be full of sensors of all kinds. Chemical sensors, cameras and microphones of all types and shapes. Sensors will check the quality of the air and temperatures. Microphones around your environment will listen to you giving commands.""

This is going to be a world where connected devices and sensors are all around us -- even inside us, Sangiovanni-Vincentelli said in an interview with Computerworld during DARPA's Wait, what? Forum on future technology in St. Louis this week.

""It's actually exciting,"" he said. ""In the next 10 years, it's going to be tremendous.""

According to the Berkeley professor and researcher, we won't have just smartphones.

We'll have a swarm of sensors that are intelligent and interconnected.

Most everything in our environment -- from clothing to furniture and our very homes -- could be smart. Sensors could be mixed with paint and spread onto our walls.

We'll just speak out loud and information will instantly be given to us without having to do an online search, phone calls can be made or a robot could start to clean or make dinner.

And with sensors implanted in our brains , we wouldn't even need to speak out loud to interact with our smart environment.

Want something? Just think about it.

""The brain-machine interface will have sensors placed in our brains, collecting information about what we think and transmitting it to this complex world that is surrounding us,"" said Sangiovanni-Vincentelli. ""I think I'd like to have an espresso and then here comes a nice little robot with a steaming espresso because I thought about it.""

Pam Melroy, deputy director of DARPA's Tactical Technology Office, said the Berkeley professor isn't just dreaming.

""I do think there's something to that"" scenario, said Melroy, who is a retired U.S. Air Force officer and former NASA astronaut. ""At the very least, we should be preparing for it and thinking of what is needed. We get into very bad places when technology outstrips our planning and thinking. I'd rather worry about that and prepare for it even if it takes 20 years to come true, than just letting it evolve in a messy way.""

While having a trillion-device life could happen in as little as 10 years, Sangiovanni-Vincentelli said there's a lot of work to be done to get there.

First, we simply don't have the network we'd need to support this many connected devices.

We would need communication protocols that consume very small amounts of energy and can transmit fluctuating amounts of information, the professor explained. Businesses would need to build massive numbers of tiny, inexpensive sensors. We'll need more and better security to fend off hacks to our clothing, walls and brains.

And the cloud will have to be grown out to handle all of the data that these trillion devices will create.

""Once you have the technology enabling all of this, we should be there in 10 years,"" said Sangiovanni-Vincentelli.

With all of these devices, many people will be anxious about what this means for personal privacy.

Sangiovanni-Vincentelli won't be one of them, though.

""Lack of privacy is not an issue,"" he said. ""We've already lost it all... If the government wants me now, they have me. Everything is already recorded somewhere. What else is there to lose?""

Melroy also is more excited than nervous about this increasingly digital future.

""As a technologist, I don't fear technology,"" she said. ""I think having ways that make us healthier and more efficient are a good thing... There is social evolution that happens with technological evolution. We once were worried about the camera and the privacy implications of taking pictures of people. The challenge is to make the pace of change match the social evolution.""",0.47844071144960376,0.7784407114496037,-0.2,-0.1
255440,True,547,"The Pennsylvania Railroad Harsimus Branch Embankment, a massive sectional retaining wall that traverses six residential blocks between Fifth and Sixth Streets, is one of the few intact relics of the legendary Pennsylvania Road-arguable the largest, wealthiest, and most influential of several railroad companies that occupied Jersey City's landscape for nearly 150 years.

Designed by James J. Ferris, a prominent civil engineer and politician in Jersey City for whom a local high school is named (Ferris also supervised the piling and pouring of the Powerhouse's vast concrete foundation), the Embankment was erected form 1901-1905 to replace an older iron and timer embankment that was deemed too low and unstable.

The Pennsylvania Railroad commissioned Ferris to design the elevated freight line on Sixth Avenue to bring seven railway lines through downtown Jersey City to Harsimus yard on the Hudson River. According to local historian John Gomez, "". . . Ferris made a conscious, successful attempt at integrating the massive structure into the surrounding residential streetscapes with as much elegance and beauty as one can give a stone bridge. The colossal granite and sandstone embankment soared segmentally - block by block, connected by steel bridges - past tenement windows, stables, warehouses and places of worship. Christened the Pennsylvania Railroad Stem Embankment, it stands as Ferris's engineering masterwork - and it turns out, his only surviving span.""


Residents of the quiet historic neighborhoods of Harsimus Cove and Hamilton Park, perfectly separated by the Embankment, had to adjust to this powerful structure. Around-the-clock steam locomotives carrying produce and live cattle cargo emerged westerly from the Pennsylvania Railroad Cut, traveled past tenement windows atop the 7-track Embankment, and led directly to the Harsimus Cove freight yards and waterfront wharves. Constructed of enormous sandstone and granite blocks, the Embankment reaches a breathtaking height of 27 feet at its western terminus near Brunswick Street. Each block-long section is 400 feet long and 100 feet wide. Gigantic plate girder bridges connected each segment but were dismantled in 1996 by Conrail and sold for scrap. Although no longer utilized, the Embankment is recognized as an engineering monument and was entered into the State Register of Historic Places in 1999.

Sort of a ""one more thing"" moment in Milan, the BMW HP4 Race was teased to the assembled EICMA press – giving us a look at their ultra-premium version of the BMW S1000RR Superbike, and it drips in carbon fiber.

Of course what really sets the BMW HP4 Race apart is the fact that it uses a twin-spar carbon fiber frame, making it, and the recently debuted Ducati 1299 Superleggera, the only production motorcycles with such a feature.

Details beyond what we can see are very scarce from BMW Motorrad, though we do know that we can expect the BMW HP4 Race to debut in the second-half of 2017. The name suggests that the bike might not be homologated for street use, but time will have to tell on that.

From looking at the concept bike in Milan, we can see that the carbon fiber chassis is joined by carbon fiber wheels and carbon fiber fairings. As such, we would expect a 20 lbs weight reduction, or more, from HP4 Race compared to the older HP4 model.

That should make the BMW HP4 Race one of the lightest superbikes on the market, though that ultimate title will likely stay with its Italian counterpart.

Other items we see are an Akrapovic exhaust, Brembo brakes, and Öhlins FGR forks (likely paired with an Öhlins TTX rear shock) – all standard items for a track-focused machine that spares no expense.

You have to feel bad for BMW in a way though, debuting such a bombshell of a bike, just a day after Ducati dropped the 1299 Superleggera, sort of steals the thunder from such a spectacular machine. Still, the S1000RR is one of the best superbikes on the market, and it only got better in its HP4 trim.

As such, we expect great things from the BMW HP4 Race once it officially debuts. The question is though, how many will be built, and how much will they cost? We need to start finding new homes for some of our organs…

With Liverpool closing on a deal to make Jurgen Klopp their new manager, we look at the backroom team the German may bring with him to Anfield.

Liverpool's owners, the Fenway Sports Group, are expected to allow Klopp to hire his own assistants, likely to comprise of those who worked alongside him during his seven years at the Westfalenstadion.

MAIN ALLIES

These are Klopp's most trusted lieutenants who could follow him to Merseyside if he becomes Liverpool boss:

Peter Krawietz

Peter Krawietz is Klopp's video analyst and chief scout

Krawietz would be one of Klopp's two main assistants at Liverpool having worked alongside him at both Mainz and then Borussia Dortmund.

The 43-year-old - who never played professional football - specialises as a video analyst concentrating on his own team, as well as the opposition, while he has also been Klopp's chief scout during the course of the last 14 years.

Described by former Dortmund midfielder Paul Lambert as being ""very good"" at his job, Krawietz was promoted to be Klopp's assistant coach at Dortmund.

""Peter is a big part of his team and he was at Mainz with him. He knows him really well and is someone who he trusts to be very analytical about the game. He's someone he'll lean on,"" the Scott added.

""I also liaise with the amateurs and youth squad, and tell the people in charge what's important to the head coach,"" is how he described part of his job at the Westfalenstadion.

Zeljko Buvac

Klopp and his trusted right-hand man Zeljko Buvac, aka 'The Brain', during their time together at Dortmund

Buvac is Klopp's other key coaching ally, with the pair having known each other since 1992 when they were team-mates at Mainz.

Buvac hung up his boots in 1998, managing SC Neukirchen with little success for three years until Klopp appointed him as his assistant when he took over at the Coface Arena in 2001, before then following him to Dortmund seven years later.

The Bosnian - currently head coach of the Republika Srpska national team - is Klopp's right-hand man in charge of training sessions and is known as 'The Brain' due to his expert tactical knowledge of the game.

""Zeljko is a football genius, a master of every practice drill,"" Klopp says of his close friend, while Lambert called the 54-year-old: ""Very quiet, but excellent. I can understand why Jurgen calls him that ['The Brain']. I have seen him working; he does not say much, but is very astute on the game.""

Dortmund midfielder Nuri Sahin, who also spent a period on loan at Liverpool, says the duo have a telepathic relationship.

""Zeljko Buvac is basically Klopp's twin,"" Sahin told the Bundesliga website. ""Both of them see football in exactly the same way.""

Nuri Sahin spent five months at Anfield in the 2012-13 campaign

Klopp, Krawietz and Buvac have formed a hugely successful partnership at Mainz and Dortmund since 2001, with Lambert saying of the trio: ""They work really well and are an excellent team. You can see on the pictures just how close they are.

Wolfgang de Beer

Wolfgang de Beer is Dortmund's goalkeeping coach

De Beer kept goal for Dortmund for 15 years before a serious knee injury forced him to hang up his gloves in 2001, with the German going on to become the Bundesliga club's goalkeeping coach a year later.

The 51-year-old stayed at the Signal Iduna Park following Klopp's departure at the end of last season, so it is not known whether he would follow him to Merseyside or not.

256600,False,1024,"""It can't be easy, that's all I'm saying…"", And Kate wants to yell it out, that of course it isn't easy, that that much should be obvious. She wants to howler at the one who presents herself as her friend, and she wants to kick and scream; She wants to foam at the mouth, and she wants her reply to be sharp.


But of course Kate knows that she would never do any of those things. It's just isn't how she was raised. Besides it's Max that's talking to her, and Max doesn't deserve any of her rage.


A lot can be said for the plastic smiles and little snarky comments that Kate has fallen victim to lately, she feels - herself - in part guilty for what happened. How can she not? It was her decision, and it was her drink and - no matter what happened, no matter if she was tricked into going with a false pretense or not, she still went. And no matter how many times Max tells her it wasn't her fault she can't quite believe it.


Maybe it's punishment for her feelings. Divine intervention in a way? Kate doesn't know if she should cry or yell out. She's confused. Everything in her mind is fuzzy, has been for so long now. Ever since she met Max that first day.


Not that she can't separate what she feels, from how she should feel, it's just hard - harder than it should be - and she has more pressing issues in her mind. And she can't quite push herself to yell at Max, or at anyone really. She's just defeated, pushed and abused and tired. All the things her mother and family warned her about and yet -


It truly is hard to be a philistine, to be able to enjoy the delicate curves in the nape of Max's neck, or the way her eyes glitter when she smiles, or even the way there's this slight hesitation, how her mouth slowly curves upwards, before she speaks. If there's something Kate truly appreciates about her object of desire, about the one that she met in that ill fated day, is that she's always positive. Like a Proton, not that Kate has always paid much attention to science class but she knows that Max is like one. She never seems to doubt, question, or give up. Like she's lived through stuff a thousand times and she knows what she's doing.


Kate is just about to go into how she would like to know what she, herself is doing with her life; How she'd like a plan, a guide to follow that's not the one her family brought upon her - because that one has been failed, so so hard - When Max speaks.

It takes her a moment to catch on all the levity on Max's voice. The way she half shrugs and does her best to make her feel better. It comes naturally to her. Not an edge to her voice, not one ounce of tension. It's like she practiced this moment over and over. Kate would really know how she's able to do it so easily.


Maybe it isn't easy, but that just how it seems to her. Max is practically perfect at this stuff, but then what is Max not good at?


""Hello, earth to Kate, are you ok?"" , Again, the same question, just more directly asked . It has never been easy being her, and no, she's not ok. But she's sure that Max can't do much more than she did to help her. And why bother pointing it out? She's probably only running on her good will.

Kate attempts to smile. Attempts being the key word there, she isn't quite sure if she succeeds, wh a t with every single doubt in her he ad multiplied tenfold. She isn't sure if Max buys it or not, but, as much as she wishes to be able to pass all her doubts as momentary, little chimps in her armor, she isn't all that sure that is possible.

She has read the messages, straight from her family. She knows what people think of her. Heck she knows her reputation, and what every action and word she has ever said has been invalidated, like it's purely a front.


And then Max touches her. Kate can't help it, she recoils at the contact. What is wrong with her? Why can't she even be touched by the one she dares call a friend without retreating into herself? How can she prove to Max she's fine like that? Hands caressing her cross like it is the only thing she still has as a base, tears that insist on creeping into her eyes, smile that rings untrue?

Max, blessed might she be, understands her mistake and too, retreats. Pushing herself away from Kate, leaving her wondering if this is it, if Max is giving",0.0,0.6897249886818793,-0.9,0.0

256750,True,1006,"Ihsahn has been out with Emperor for a series of reunion shows this year and spoke with Noisey of the experience, among other things. One such topic was the changing perception of metal, of which Ihsahn offered the following take:

For us being here now against being there then, I guess our whole career is built on this kind of mystique almost. People didn't know shit about us. We were just crazy Norwegians from a place that most people hadn't heard of doing this extreme music in this strange makeup. [Laughs] So people had absolutely no clue. Whereas today you get in touch with the biggest stars on Twitter or Facebook or whatever. Nothing is private. It's very bad times to be kind of a mysterious black metal artist, I guess. It'd be very hard to build that kind of niche again if you were a young band starting out today. [Laughs]""

""I think particularly black metal has gone gray like many other metal subgenres or like music in general, really. You start out new as a phenomenon, and there gradually becomes different directions in that. Some people do something new, and then some people copy it, and it becomes watered down. It becomes gray. A lot of people involved in this genre originally do a lot of other interesting stuff. The genre itself has changed, but I think extreme music – it's more a matter of the whole music industry having changed. That's kind of the biggest thing if you take black metal now and then.

Those hoping the live reunion in support of the 20th anniversary of ""In The Nightside Eclipse"" would stoke some creative embers will be left in the cold though. When asked if new music or a full-fledged reunion was in the works, Ihsahn offered:


""Not at all. Not at all. I couldn't really see the point. I don't think that would be something that would feel natural and feel creative, and that's not meant to disrespect the other guys that I play with. But if you listen to the music that Samoth does now, there's quite a big difference between what he does and what I do. I think, musically, we can come together and perform the stuff that we did when those musical differences were constructive.

If it was up to me, Emperor now would sound like my solo stuff. Not that I would ever call it Emperor because then it wouldn't be that as it would be compromised. For me it would just be a different logo on the front because for me in the way I want to express myself in metal now, that's what I already do. To make an Emperor album, I'm sure financially speaking, it would be tempting.

It's a well-known brand, and you could probably do a lot of things promotion wise with it, but at the same time, it's the fact that we've maintained, and the fact that we've been uncompromising. I think both with Emperor and the stuff we've done outside of Emperor, I'm very conscious about that mutual agreement with my listeners who pick up my album and make this possible. I don't want to trick myself, and I don't want to screw them either. So every time I make an album I honestly try to do my absolute best, and I don't think I do my best if I start thinking about what would people want and what would people expect of me or this or that.

If we did that with Emperor or outside of Emperor, people would smell the dishonesty in that. It's not really an ego trip, either. Of course it is very egotistical and selfish of me in a very good way of just doing exactly what I want, but at the same time I think that is the most honest way of doing this. If people want to make music that people expect to have and what the market wants, that's kind of a different genre and a different industry. [Laughs]

People who want Emperor to get back together, I'm not sure if they know what they're asking for. What kind of Emperor album would it be? Would it be something we could honestly do in 2014 or 2015? It would be easy for us to make an album that sounded like something from back in the day in the vein of Eclipse or Anthems or whatever, but who would actually want that? It would be pointless, and in the end I think people respect it.

It's like when you get older and some people start wishing ""Oh, I wish I was young again."" It's not gonna happen, but it's a nice thought. But at the same time, if you were young again, you wouldn't want to experience all that crap all over again either way. [Laughs] It's kind of like that, and I honestly think that it creates a bit of trust between us as artists and the audience.""",0.013783803031496261,0.7137838030314964,-0.6000000000000001,-0.1

Specifically, the company looked at visitors to Onswipe-optimized sites for the period of Dec. 26-29 in comparison to Dec. 19-22, as a way to measure the growth that different tablet platforms saw over Christmas. The results? Samsung's Galaxy tablets grew 50.4 percent, Nexus 7 tablets grew 33.8 percent, iPads grew 20.4 percent, and Kindle Fires grew 19.5 percent.

Now, the fact that Onswipe focused on percentage growth is an important caveat here. After all, Samsung was presumably starting from (much) less, so it didn't need to sell as many tablets to see significant growth.

It's also interesting to see the line about Samsung's victory coming from Baptiste, who recently wrote a blog post telling people to ""stop believing the fairy tales about the iPad's demise."" I asked him if the data made him reconsider the post, and he said no: ""Though they enjoyed more growth post holidays, Samsung is still very tiny compared to the iPad and the same goes for the rest of Android. What will be interesting is seeing whether people still use Android tablets 90 days out from now.""

Baptiste also provided some numbers about usage. He said the average session time from Samsung users was three minutes and nine seconds after Christmas, down from 3:32 before.

But the jury failed to reach a unanimous verdict on related conspiracy charges.

Pedro Espada Jr. and his son, Pedro Gautier Espada, were accused of bilking more than $600,000 from Soundview HealthCare Center, which has received more than $1 million in federal funding. The elder Espada, a former three-term Democratic senator representing the Bronx, serves as CEO of Soundview, which was founded in 1978.

After 11 days of tense deliberations, the jury on Monday told U.S. District Judge Frederic Block that Espada, 58, was guilty of four counts of theft. The jury then deliberated for several more hours before announcing they were unable to reach a verdict on the remaining four counts against Espada, which included theft and conspiracy.

A mistrial was declared on all eight counts against Pedro Gautier Espada.

Block gave prosecutors until June 5 to decide whether to retry the Espadas on all or some of the undetermined counts.

After the verdict was read, Espada appeared somber, comforting his wife in the courtroom.

""It's a sad day for Mr. Espada, and a sadder day for Soundview and the community,"" Espada's attorney, Susan Necheles, said outside the courthouse.

Brooklyn U.S. Attorney Loretta Lynch said Espada will ""now be held to account for his crimes.""

""The people of the Bronx trusted Pedro Espada to have their best interests at heart,"" Lynch said in a statement following the verdict. ""Instead, he abused that trust to the tune of more than half a million dollars.""

New York Governor Andrew Cuomo also weighed in on the verdict, calling Espada ""the prime example of government corruption.""

ACCUSATIONS OF BULLYING

Deliberations nearly ground to a halt several times in the two weeks since the jury received the case. On Wednesday, Block told jurors to resume deliberations after they sent him a note that they were ""deadlocked."" In other notes, there were complaints that one juror refused to deliberate and accusations of bullying.

During the six-week trial, witnesses for the government included Maria Cruz, Espada's long-time assistant, who said he put family members on Soundview's payroll and its board of directors.

Other Soundview employees testified that Espada routinely spent clinic funds on personal items like presents and flowers, fancy meals and even an elaborate child's birthday party featuring a pony. The Espadas also were accused of rigging bids for cleaning contracts with Soundview.

Necheles acknowledged during the trial that her client spent Soundview's money, but only as part of his contract, which entitled him to pay certain personal expenses with company funds. If any of the funds were used improperly, it was the fault of Soundview's accountants, who apparently green-lit the payments, she said.

Espada, who served as New York Senate majority leader from 2009 until 2010, was ousted from his Senate seat in the 2010 primary election. He faces up to 40 years in prison for the counts on which he has been convicted.

Such is the phrase of many people going through that point in life known in media as ""adulting""- or being responsible enough to actually care about where your money goes.

Whether we like it or not, money is inseparably connected to our life. In financial perspectives, money should not be the root of all evil. Money is what you make to have the finer things in life, not necessarily to make you rich—but something you need to have security so you and your family can have a comfortable life, plus some extra perks.

Going through different milestones in life also calls for different aspirations. What you dream as a child is not the same when you reach college. What you may have aspired in your twenties has now changed in your forties.

Many of us were not really educated in school when it comes to handling money. Majority of graduates who go into the workforce barely have any idea regarding the habits they should develop the moment they receive their first paycheck. Only a few are actually aware of how important it is to set their financial goals. You've come to the right page if you want to equip yourself with basic knowledge about the right attitudes toward your finances according to your life stage.

Let's get started.

Stage 1: Entering the Workforce – Early Career Years

If you are still on this stage and you are reading this blog post, congratulations! You should know that the first step toward better financial literacy when you are in your early career years is making a budget and tracking your expenses. If you are still paying your students loans, prioritize paying off your debt. Remember that you need to build a good credit history while in this stage of life. When you have a favorable financial standing according to bank standards, it becomes easier to purchase an asset such as a car or a dream home on credit once you plan on settling down maybe five to ten years from now.

You should also start planning your retirement and take advantage of 401(k), 403(b), Roth IRA and the likes that your employer might be offering. Also, even when you're still in your 20's and single, a disability insurance policy is crucial. This is to protect your income in case of a sudden event that prohibits you from working and earning. If you get seriously sick for example, the disability insurance can cover your expenses while recuperating and you don't have to incur debt because of medical expenses.

In summary, these are the things you must accomplish during your early career years:

Build your savings and establish a good credit history. Avoid increasing your consumer and high interest rate debts any further and pay the outstanding ones as soon as possible. Live within your means. Start thinking about your retirement and set up your financial accounts. Get disability insurance.

You may also welcome the idea of scouting for a reliable financial planner. As you advance in your career and possibly consider starting your own family at the later part of this stage in your life, a fee-based expert in wealth management with an eye on your goals can help you out in ensuring that you are on the right track in terms of your finances.

Stage 2: Family and Career Building Years

Are you about to settle down or have already built a family? Settling down is more than just getting married and having your dream house. It comes with greater responsibilities and of course greater expectations. It is not a matter of your personal dreams anymore because your aspirations have to match your spouse's, especially when it comes to building a home– a.k.a. having kids.

Of course, what first goes to mind is buying a house. Buying such an asset is important, especially if the family is growing. However, buying a house also means securing your budget for maintenance, amortization, utilities, and other expenses. Therefore, protecting your income becomes all the more important than when you were single. This is to keep your family protected in the event of some of life's risks, such as an untimely death and temporary or permanent disability.

In this life stage, your goals should include:

Buying life insurance. Purchasing health insurance. Updating your disability insurance. Reviewing your estate plan and preparing your will. Saving for your child's college education. Starting your own business or building your career further. Growing your savings.

While saving will always be an important goal for every life stage, spending on things that can protect your family from risks is always a good investment.

Setting up your estate plan and preparing your will are also vital as you increase your assets and produce more beneficiaries. They are vital for a very simple reason: you love your family.

As for preparing for your child's college education, there are variable unit-linked life insurance policies where the plan is designed to grow your premiums in favor of educational and retirement planning. Explore your options.

Translated by: Hypersheep325

Edited by: Michyrr


No matter who it was—in that brief moment she had been unable to clearly make out the other person's appearance—it was definitely one of the human cultivators that had entered the Garden of Zhou. This was enough of a reason. It was enough for Xu Yourong who was flying around Sunset Valley to unsparingly use up her true essence once more to adjust her direction and fly over to that heavily injured and unconscious human cultivator's side. At that critical point where it seemed like she would dash herself to death against the ground, she grabbed the cultivator and flew off into the distance.

She had no experience in flying with wings, but she had a lot of experience riding the white crane as it soared through the blue sky. As she soared through the night sky, she had none of that imagined unease or terror. But she was just a beginner after all, so it was hard to avoid some improficiency and awkwardness. This was especially the case when considering that she was already heavily wounded and very weak, and that she was now carrying an extra person. It was hard to avoid swaying a bit, giving the appearance that she was drunk.

It was not too long before Nanke had caught up, only several li behind. Separated by such a distance, she could even feel the killing intent coming from her. She did not turn around, instead focused on learning how to fly. Her wings of fire began to sway less, her posture grew more stable, and her speed began to quicken. Gradually she began to turn into a streak of fire blazing through the night sky.

After the awakening of the phoenix soul, she had comprehended many principles, and gained use of much of her innate ability. Solely in terms of speed, she was without a doubt the fastest on the continent. Whether it was the Red Falcons used by the Great Zhou army or the Great Western Continent's Heavenly Messenger Birds, whether it was Nanke or the swift Silver Dragons; none of them could surpass her speed.

The problem was that she was severely wounded. An even larger problem was that she was currently carrying a person. The person was unconscious, and weighed her down like a wet bag of flour. If she dropped this person, even Nanke would find it very hard to catch up to her. She could go back to the gardens where the rest of the human cultivators had congregated and develop a counterattack against the demon plot. She could also temporarily escape, treat her wounds and the poison in her body, then return to battle Nanke, and this time she believed she would definitely obtain victory.

But she could not do so, so there was no 'if'.

This entire time, she had not glanced at the person in her hands—she made no distinction of identity, because no matter what, she could not throw them away. It was just like Nanke had said at the peak of Sunset Valley. From beginning to end, she was an existence burdened with the word 'responsibility'. Many choices had already become a sort of instinct for her. She did not need to ponder them or weigh the pros and cons, she only needed to carry them out.

Two streams of light skimmed over the forests and wetland at the edge of the plain, their colors only slightly different. Wherever they passed, bits of grass were sent flying and leaves were shocked into puffs of green.

She had never been able to pull away from Nanke and her vision was starting to go fuzzy. This was a sign that the peacock's poison was beginning to erode her sea of consciousness. She had always been using the Heavenly Phoenix's true blood to suppress it, but over the course of this chase, that blood was gradually being boiled away and was no longer able to suppress the poison. Perhaps she could ignite all the Heavenly Phoenix true blood to go even faster, but then what would she do about the poison?

Nanke's figure grew closer and closer and the darkness of the surrounding plain was newly dyed with green. There was no time to think, but in truth, she didn't even think before she made her decision. At this moment, she finally lowered her head to glance at the person in her hands. She helplessly thought to herself, everyone here cultivates the Dao, paying attention to dining with the pure wind and eating the starlight, but just what are you eating every day that you're so heavy?

Then she ignited the meager remnants of the true blood of the Heavenly Phoenix in her body.

With a boom, the surrounding plains began to burn, and glimmers of light from water could be vaguely seen under the grass.

Xu Yourong turned into a streak of fire, and disappeared into the sky.

258216,True,630,"President Barack Obama is calling anew on Congress to end tax subsidies for the oil and gas industry, saying the nation needs to develop alternative sources of energy in the face of rising gasoline prices.

Obama said Saturday in his weekly radio and Internet address that he expected Congress to consider in the next few weeks halting $4 billion in tax subsidies, something he hasn't been able to get through Congress throughout his presidency. He said the vote would put lawmakers on record on whether they ""stand up for oil companies"" or ""stand up for the American people.""

""They can either place their bets on a fossil fuel from the last century or they can place their bets on America's future,"" Obama said.

Industry officials and many Republicans in Congress have argued that cutting the tax breaks would lead to higher fuel prices, raising costs on oil companies and affecting their investments in exploration and production. The measure is considered a long shot in Congress, given that Obama couldn't end the subsidies when Democrats controlled Congress earlier in his term.

Republican presidential candidates have accused Obama of delaying drilling for oil in the Gulf of Mexico and in a national wildlife refuge in Alaska and faulted him for not advancing the Keystone XL oil pipeline from Canada to Texas Gulf Coast refineries. They have also criticized policies pursued by the Environmental Protection Agency as inhibiting energy development.

Obama said there is no quick fix to high gas prices, which climbed to $3.83 on Friday according to AAA, but he pushed back against critics who say he is opposed to more drilling. He said the U.S. is producing more oil than at any time in the past eight years and has quadrupled the number of operating oil rigs.

""If we're truly going to make sure we're not at the mercy of spikes in gas prices every year, the answer isn't just to drill more -- because we're already drilling more,"" Obama said. He said his administration was trying to develop wind and solar power, biofuels and usher in more fuel-efficient vehicles to make the nation less dependent on oil.

In the weekly Republican address, Rep. Cory Gardner, R-Colo., said his constituents have been hard hit by an increase in gasoline prices and were ""fed up with the way the president is handling this issue, and rightfully so. The most forceful thing the president has done about high gas prices is try to explain that he's against them.""

Gardner said the $800 billion stimulus spending sought by Obama promoted energy companies that went bankrupt, wasting taxpayer money.

""After spending money we don't have on what won't work -- and overregulating what would -- is it any wonder gas prices have more than doubled on the president's watch? Make no mistake, high gas prices are a symptom of his failed `stimulus' policies,"" Gardner said.

Obama is expected to keep up a drumbeat on energy this week, traveling to four states over two days to push his administration's ""all of the above"" energy strategy. The trip includes stops in Nevada, New Mexico, Oklahoma and Ohio.",0.8205369105166316,0.8205369105166316,0.0,0.0
255169,False,1024,"LOS ANGELES -- Federal Communications Commission Chairman Tom Wheeler wants consumers to be able to say goodbye to their cable set-top boxes.

In a Los Angeles Times op-ed piece published Thursday, Wheeler is proposing a new rule that would require cable and satellite video companies to offer consumers the option to receive their channels through apps that provide streaming video over the Internet. Consumers have long chafed at having to pay for set-top boxes to get a cable signal.

""If adopted, consumers will no longer have to rent a set-top box, month after month,"" Wheeler wrote. ""Instead, pay-TV providers will be required to provide apps -- free of charge -- that consumers can download to the device of their choosing to access all the programming and features they already paid for.""

Wheeler's proposal comes six months after the Federal Communications Commission voted 3-2 along party lines to begin crafting rules intended to spur competition in the set-top box market by developing technology standards so that third-party devices and apps could decode pay-TV signals.

Such a service would enable consumers to watch cable channels over on an Internet-connected television or device such as an Xbox, Roku or AppleTV.

Cable and satellite companies collect a combined $20 billion annually in rental fees, adding to the overall cost of cable or satellite service. Wheeler cited an analysis that said consumers pay an average of $231 annually for the use of a box.

Wheeler's plan was praised by consumer groups but met with strong criticism by the cable industry. The companies and their trade group, the NationalCable and Telecommunications Assocation, characterized Wheeler's plan as an act of government overreach that goes beyond the FCC's authority.

""This proposal would far exceed the Commission's legal authority and improperly insert the government into private contract negotiations between payTV distributors, content creators and device manufacturers,"" the NCTA said in a statement.

Wheeler, who has long been an advocate of bringing down the cost of video service to consumers, said studies have shown that 84 percent of consumers believe their cable bill is too high. About 99 percent of the nation's 100 million pay-TV subscribers rent at least one set-top box.

""We keep paying these charges even after the cost of the box has been recovered because we have no meaningful alternative,"" he said.

Wheeler also believes the industry needs to adapt to the technological changes that have already upended the television industry through the increased number of programming choices they have provided. A rapidly growing number of consumers, especially in the 18 to 34 age group, are turning to online streaming for their video content and want more options through Internet platforms.

""This proposal is an important step in giving consumers new, innovative choices in a market that's had limited -- if any -- competition for years,"" Consumers Union said in a statement.

Wheeler's plan gives large pay TV providers, such as Comcast and DirecTV, two years to offer streaming apps to their customers. Medium-sized companies would have an additional two years while smaller providers would be exempt.

About 90 percent of cable and satellite customers are served by the companies that will have to adopt the service in two years.

Cable companies already have the technology that offers their channels through apps, but the rental of a set-top box is required.

Opposition from the cable industry, which has been anticipating Wheeler's move, came quickly after his official announcement. Comcast, the largestcable provider in the U.S., said the proposed regulation would hurt the technological development of apps.

""Heavy-handed government technology mandates have a long history of failure,"" the company said in a statement. ""The Chairman's approach would likely meet the same fate, while causing real damage to the thriving apps marketplace and real harm to consumers.""

Charter Communications called Wheeler's plan ""a valid goal,"" but argued the marketplace is already meeting consumer demand for apps that provide video service. ""The FCC's mandate threatens to bog down with regulations and bureaucracy the entire TV app market that consumers are increasingly looking to for innovation, choice and competition,"" the company said in a statement.

It's not clear whether Wheeler's proposal will be approved by the FCC. Comissioner Michael O'Rielly echoed the concerns of the industry.

""I will review this proposal carefully over the coming days and weeks, but at the outset it appears to exist within a fantasy world of unlimited Commission authority,"" he said. ""The Commission is and must remain in the business of licensing spectrum and infrastructure, not content.""

MPAA Chairman and Chief Executive Chris Dodd said he will need assurance that an FCC mandate to provide streaming apps does not interfere with the ability of program producers and creators to negotiate issues related to online usage of their content.

""The FCC must not encroach upon copyright holders' discretion in how they exercise or license the exclusive rights,"" Dodd said.

Even with the rise of responsive design, many of us begin with the ""full size"" site and work our way down.

There's a growing trend in the industry though to flip this workflow on its head and actually begin with mobile considerations and then work up to a larger desktop version. Why would you ever approach a project this way? What are some of the pros and cons of this strategy? Read on to find out!

This article is part of our series on ""looking beyond desktop design"", brought to you in partnership with Heart Internet VPS.

Mobile Web Design Isn't a Niche

If you still have it in your head that mobile web design and application development is a niche industry, you need to change your way of thinking. Mobile isn't a trend, nor is it even the future, it's the present. Don't believe me? Here are some crazy statistics to consider from Mobithinking from last month.

There are over 1.2 billion mobile web users worldwide

mobile web users worldwide In the U.S., 25% of mobile Web users are mobile-only (they rarely use a desktop to access the web)

Mobile apps have been downloaded 10.9 billion times

Mobile device sales are increasing across the board with over 85 percent of new handsets able to access the mobile Web

One of the most potent facts here is the second item, which brings to light that many users will likely only ever see the mobile version of your site. That's an astounding revelation isn't it?

More than ever before the web is something that we carry in our pockets, not something that merely hangs out near our desk or even in our homes. This is a global trend that will only continue to see growth in the coming years. Are you ready for this? Does your professional skill set include web development for all important platforms or just the desktop arena?

Why Mobile First?

Odds are none of the people reading this have learned anything new up to this point. The $200+ phones in the pockets of everyone you know are all the indication you need that the web has broken out of its computer shaped box.

However, the fact that mobile web access is popular does almost nothing to convince me that I need to pursue a strategy that actually puts mobile first. The flip side of 25% of mobile users being mobile-only is that 75% of them aren't! Obviously, the desktop is still an important medium, not to be forgotten or pushed to the back burner quite yet. So why are we even considering taking the mobile first route?

One of the major catalysts for the rise of mobile first web design was the announcement from Eric Schmidt in 2010 that Google was going to be taking this approach from now on, going so far as to say ""I think it's now the joint project of all of us to make mobile the answer to pretty much everything"" (source). Why this drastic change in approach?

Graceful Degradation vs. Progressive Enhancement

These are some major buzz words from a few years ago that can still lend a lot of insight into the notion of mobile first web design and why it's an important concept to consider.

Graceful degradation arose out of a need to have a design function on as many browsers and platforms as possible. Designers and developers wanted to take advantage of new technology without excluding users with setups that didn't have support. The general conclusion was to create and serve up the best experience possible, and then account for each possible degradation and ensure that despite any shortcomings, the site would remain functional.

In terms of mobile web design, this meant that a full, standard website would scale back and gradually remove content and features as the viewport became smaller and the system simpler (no Flash support, etc.).

Out of this trend arose a powerful new idea: progressive enhancement. In this version of the tale, you put your best foot forward on the mobile platform, providing the users with minimal screen real estate, processing power and third party plugins an amazing experience that both looks great and functions perfectly. As the need arises, the site can gradually be ""enhanced"" and even completely rethought for larger platforms with fewer constraints.

Why Progressive Enhancement Wins

At a glance, these two methodologies seem roughly equivalent. Who cares where you begin the design process as long as it gets done, right?

The reality of the situation is a little more complex though. When you start with the desktop platform, you tend want to take advantage of everything that platform has to offer. You build an amazing product that leverages lots of great technology, only to realize that none of it scales well down to mobile. This can and does lead to severely watered down mobile products that feel more like an afterthought than a polished, finished",0.3621278576738558,0.7621278576738558,-0.30000000000000004,-0.1

NEW ORLEANS (WGNO) - In New Orleans, random acts of kindness have been taken to a new level in an effort to prove that good will triumph over evil.

Good Samaritan and New Orleans business owner Frank Scurlock says he's just trying to remind people that goodness will prevail if you let it.

He hired a Kentucky-based skywriter, Nathan Hammond, to spread some joy over the city for 10 days.

""The weather is gorgeous. This is what we dream for. Bluebird skies, cool weather,"" says Hammond.

Hammond is one of only a handful of professional skywriters in existence. He has a conference call with Scurlock twice a day, to determine the content and location for the day's positive messages in the sky.

""It's crazy actually, my phones are blowing up. Social media is blowing up. The media is blowing up. It's been phenomenal,"" says Scurlock.

For Hammond, this is a much bigger job than usual.

""Normally we do 'Will you marry me?' or 'Eat at Joe's,' so when he said we want to do 10 days and three messages a day, it took us off guard a little bit,"" says Hammond.

Since skywriters are allowed to turn off their radios for better concentration, Hammond says he works directly with Air Traffic Control when he's flying.

""They still see me on the radar, but I don't have any distractions coming in, no noise coming in through the headset or anything like that, so that I can focus strictly on what I'm doing and make sure that the message is where it needs to be, when it needs to be, pointed in the right direction and spelled correctly,"" he adds.

What's the cost of all this philanthropic flying? So far, the bill is between $20,000 and $25,000. The last flight is scheduled for Sunday. Hammond says he'll also be decorating the sky over Baton Rouge sometime soon.

Charla Miller works with the man behind the messages and she says her boss has even bigger plans.

""He has a big concern for the violence that has been going on locally and nationally, and this has both a local scope and hopefully a future national scope for him too with the skywriting,"" says Miller.

Through his non-profit, Noigiler (""religion"" spelled backwards), he hopes to raise enough money to purchase the plane, Sky Magic, so that he can continue to share the love from above in cities across the country.

Residents and members of a community group are fixing the holes themselves. The South Austin Coalition is helping residents make rides on their pock-marked streets a little smoother by providing the material needed to fill potholes.

Potholes are everywhere. Many Chicagoans say they have to drive in the city looking down to see potholes, and that is not considered the safe way to drive. How do you avoid them? Some residents have decided to do their part. They believe the Chicago Department of Transportation is not repairing potholes fast enough, and they have become dangerous.

""You can't walk out there. You walking out there in the street at night, you can fall down and break your arm,"" said Florida Vaires, concerned Austin resident.

""The city hasn't done anything about the potholes on this block. Members of the community are taking matters into their own hands instead of doing it themselves,"" said Elce Redmond, South Austin Coalition Community Council.

Angry residents of the South Austin Coalition Community Council, who live in the 4800-block West Van Buren, have decided to take the pothole situation into their own hands and have started repairing potholes themselves. The coalition is supplying the blacktop to fill them and the residents are doing the work.

""I'm proud of these people. These people are trying to get the streets together, because it seems like the city is not doing anything around these type of neighborhoods,"" said Antoine Noifleet, Austin resident.

""In the last two months on the 4800-block of West Van Buren, we've received just one call about potholes,"" said Brian Steele, Chicago Department of Transportation.

""We are inundated with potholes, very dangerous potholes,"" said Redmond.

CDOT does not recommend residents fill the potholes for a number of reasons.

""Safety. We don't want people out on the street among active traffic. Secondly, we don't know what type of material they're using,"" Steele said.

The big question is who is responsible legally if someone gets hurt or destroys their car on a pothole repaired by a resident.

""That's a very good question, one I don't have an answer to. That's the reason why infrastructure repairs are under the purview and the responsibility of the city,"" said Steele.

""Are we willing to take responsibility? That's a good question, and one I have to look at in terms of our legal department,"" Redmond said.

Potholes can be found across the city. ABC7 drove to other blocks in the Austin Community and found potholes then went to the north Side and found too many to count.

Avoiding them can take work and they can destroy your car.

""The city has not received state funding for arterial street resurfacing since 2006. Typically we would do about 30, 40 miles of street resurfacing. We haven't been able to do that the last three years. That's starting to take its toll,"" said Steele.

Austin residents say they will continue to fill the potholes on their own.

The Chicago Department of Transportation says they are aggressively attacking potholes. They have filled over 300,000 since December 1 and fill close to 5,000 a day. The problem is there are too many.

Officials say the federal stimulus package will help the city resurface over 40 miles of streets, and the state will also provide money for over 100 miles of resurfacing, so help is on the way.",0.48414884551722825,0.7841488455172283,-0.30000000000000004,0.0
256554,True,554,"Dexter Morgan is a fictional character and the antihero of a series of novels by Jeff Lindsay. In 2006, the first novel was adapted into Showtime's original TV series DEXTER. Its companion web series Dexter Early Cuts aired in the years 2009, 2010, and 2012.

List of Novels

Television Series

There are eight seasons of DEXTER, which originally aired from 2006 to 2013. In the TV series, Dexter is a forensic blood spatter analyst who works for the fictitious Miami Metro Police Department. In his spare time, he is a vigilante serial killer who targets other murderers who have evaded the justice system. He follows a code of ethics taught to him in childhood by his adoptive father, Harry, referred to as ""The Code"" or ""The Code of Harry."" It hinges on certain principles, which include: Dexter can only kill people after finding conclusive evidence that they are guilty of murder, and he must not get caught.

Adaptation from Novels

Season 1 is largely based on the first novel, Darkly Dreaming Dexter (2004), but the following seasons veered away from the rest of the book series. In the television program, Dexter was played by Michael C. Hall, who won a Golden Globe Award for Best Actor in a Television Series or Drama in 2009. He was also portrayed as a youth by Devon Graye, Dominic Janes, Nicholas Vigneau, and Maxwell Huckabee.

There are notable distinctions between many of the characters in the Dexter novels and on Showtime's television adaptation. As can happen with books that are adapted into movies or TV series, changes were made that influenced the course of the storyline. These changes included the major characters' attributes, deaths (or introductions), along with miscellaneous information (such as their names, ages, addresses, relationships, etc.).

Debra Morgan - She has relationships with characters nonexistent in the novels. In the TV series, Debra Morgan eventually dies while, in the novels, Deborah remains very much alive.

Maria LaGuerta - Instead of being called Migdia, the creators of the show decided to name her Maria. On television, she is often seen as harsh but, at times, will reveal that she has a heart despite her unrelenting political game.

Marina is an ""intersectional feminist and a human rights advocate"" who hates the whole world because everybody is sexist and she recounts the various hassles she must endure before she finally blows up and calls her boss ""a sexist a–hole,"" which is not her fault:

this is what sexism does – it makes it impossible to win if you're a girl, or a woman, it makes your entire existance an uphill battle. and truth be told, i am getting so f–king tired. i am 23, a quarter of my life behind me, and i am already tired of educating men twice my age about what is right and appropriate. i am tired of the stares that say i am over-reacting, the replies to calm down, the polite smiles that are meant to knock me down a few pegs. i am tired of explaining to men that sexism is not this one incident, it is my entire life, my every single day. i am 23 and i am so f–king exhausted.

See? She needs to educate us about ""what is right and appropriate"" because she is 23 and an expert on everything, while the rest of us (especially men twice her age) are clueless idiots.

This is why we cannot simply laugh at feminism's death-grip on college education. Young women emerge from the protective campus cocoon — where no one is permitted to criticize feminism — and enter a world where most people don't spend their days worrying about ""human rights"" and ""intersectionality."" In the real world, people have work to do and bills to pay, and the last thing they need is for some young fanatic fresh out of college, hired for an entry-level position, to go crazy in the office because somebody made a joke she didn't like.

Feminism makes women unemployable.

A paranoid worldview that perceives misogyny and social injustice everywhere renders feminists incapable of functioning in normal life.

256548,False,1024,"Welcome to the first installment of Peak Civ, an original column by Kevin Tucker that takes on the news from an anti-civilization perspective, only on It's Going Down.

""Civilizations are artificial cultural constructions, not biological organisms, and they would be poor biological performers if we insisted on considering them as organisms."" – John Bodley, The Power of Scale

The goal here is to provide an anarcho-primitivist analysis to our dumpster fire of a reality. In nearly every realm of civilized life, the world we are sold is bursting at the seams. Daily life feels like a perpetual onslaught of depressing news and calamities, that's because it is. The history of civilization is a timeline of the consolidation of power from the mouths of priests to the coding of programmers.

Our lineage, as nomadic hunter-gatherers, still shapes the way we see, interact and understand the world. That is a lineage shaped by millions of years of egalitarian, anarchistic existence. That is a lineage that defines each of us, but is perpetually being torn apart, repackaged and sold to us through the domestication process. It keeps us from existing with the greater wild community as capable beings finding our wants and needs within each other. Ultimately turning us into consumers putting our wants and needs over each other.

Anarchism needs ecology.

If we want to understand power, if we want to understand where and how inequality arises, then we need to stop granting the illusions of the power-hungry. The State exists because it has bent carrying capacity, prolonged itself (albeit temporarily) through agriculture and technological intrusions. The State had to create the concept of nature as a separate place so that it could have us believe that civilization had conquered it. That the State was no longer held to the same realities of ecology.

Anarchism needs ecology because we need to understand that the oppression and domination of the State don't start and stop with human lives.

The reality is that we are animals. And the State is a construct upheld by physical infrastructure. It is real, no doubt. But its ideological disconnect doesn't make it true. As the industrial vigor amplified the ecological consequences of agriculture, the earth and its fluid balance began to take the hit. As forest felling timber-based fuel led way to coal mining and on to fossil fuels and nuclear power, that wound opens wider. As communities are broken down into laborers turned into slaves, that pain feels more personal.

As we are learning, we are not exempt from that wound. While the first flood of climate refugees face increasingly hostile borders and rampant xenophobia, it is clear that the fate of humanity is not separate from the fate of the wild world. Deny though we might, it doesn't stop reality.

Anarchism needs ecology because we need to understand that the oppression and domination of the State don't start and stop with human lives. If we want to understand civilization, the states that define it and the agriculture that underpins it, then we need to understand how biological organisms function. Civilization is not living, but it is parasitic. It exists on a finite planet, it bleeds its resources and communities, but it cannot exist without them. If we want to take on civilization, the State or any form of political power, then we need to see it in the way it refuses to acknowledge: an organization built upon the very ecology it denies.

The weakness of political power lies in seeing it outside of its own narrative. If you want to solve a crime, you follow the money. If you want to stop the powerful, you follow the fuel. We are all connected: our past, our present, our futures, and our fate.

Conversely, ecology needs anarchism.

Ecologists, biologists, and environmentalists can equally feed into the notion of nature as an abstraction. Many are willing to recognize that we too are animals, but they forget that we can do anything about it. Absorbed by political and corporate entities, they are fighting for an expansion of rights, for value within the terms of the State. The default becomes relying on NGOs or research that is either a corporate tax or, worse, the philanthropists' tithe.

From this view, the feed of disturbing news feels no less daunting. It might feel a little more frightening. But within that, there's the reminder that we are never alone in this.

The narratives of political power become the baseline understanding for humanity and the world. Biologists tend to regurgitate myths of domination and subservience within the wild to justify ourselves with our own captivity. They seek to anthropomorphize the wild to universalize our political dynamics so that even in the wild there is no escape. Socio-biologists, social Darwinists: narratives like Richard Dawkin's ""selfish gene"" seek to naturalize the historical creation that is civilization.

Meters along the Embarcadero are part of the Port of San Francisco's SFPark trial. Photo: Matthew Roth

No sizable city in the country, or likely the world, has been able to say with any certainty how many parking spaces it has, public or private, until now. Over the last 18 months, the San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency (MTA) has tallied every publicly accessible parking space within city limits, including free and metered spaces on-street and every publicly accessible garage [PDF map].

The total number of spaces, as Mayor Gavin Newsom recently announced on his Youtube site, is 441,541. Of the total, over 280,000 are on-street spaces, 25,000 of which are metered. For just the on-street spaces, that is roughly the equivalent area of Golden Gate Park.

""Most cities have very little knowledge of their parking inventory,"" said Rachel Weinberger, a planning professor at the University of

Pennsylvania and former transportation policy adviser to New York Mayor

Michael Bloomberg. Weinberger called the parking census a ""tremendous effort.""

""Without the basic knowledge [city planners] have no basis on which to make

decisions about future supply policy, about current management policy or

even about how their transportation systems are working.""

Don Shoup, planning professor at UCLA and author of the definitive book on the history of parking, The High Cost of Free Parking, was excited to hear the

news. ""San Francisco's census of parking spaces is a great achievement, and the

first of its kind anywhere,"" he said.

The release of the public parking space census coincides with the redesign of the website for SFPark, an occupancy-based parking management trial funded with a $19.8 million federal congestion mitigation grant, which among many objectives, seeks to manage the supply of parking by adjusting the cost to match demand. To put that in laymen's terms, if SFPark works well, there should be enough parking at the curb so that drivers don't have to circle the block endlessly searching for that elusive space. By gradually adjusting the price of parking up or down in the pilot areas, the city expects to create roughly one or two free spaces per block face at any time, the original purpose of parking meters when they were introduced in the 1930s.

Jay Primus, who directs the SFPark trial for the MTA, said the parking census was the first step toward a better understanding of how parking works in San Francisco, filling a void where city planners could only make rough estimates previously. ""If you can't manage what you can't count, doing a careful survey and documenting all publicly available parking was a critical first step for the MTA for how we manage parking more intelligently,"" he said.

Primus explained that his team combed through copious records to determine total public garage spaces, including the MTA's own facilities and city tax records for private facilities. For on-street unmetered spaces, he sent interns out across the city to count every fifth block, a 20 percent sample size. At every free opportunity, he sends out more interns and recently estimated they had increased their sample size to 35 percent. Time willing, he hoped to count every single space on every street.

Aside from satisfying his own penchant for good data, Primus said the data was essential if they expect the SFPark pilots to succeed in making parking more convenient for drivers and reducing traffic.


Click image to enlarge. Map depicting SFPark trial areas. Courtesy: sfpark.org

In order to expand the impact of the data, the MTA has released it to third-party developers on the Data SF Website, which the agency hopes will spur creative applications for smart phones much as software engineers have done

with the MTA's route and schedule information. With these applications, Primus expected to ""see less circling for parking, less

wasted fuel, and reduced greenhouse-gas emissions. It could help to save people

both time and money,"" he said.

""San Francisco is on the forefront of parking management,"" said Mayor

Newsom, who has championed open data through DataSF. ""By combining this data with our innovative approach to local

government open data, we continue to transform government to work better

for all of us.""

Beyond the benefits to drivers and the savings from reduced congestion, the parking census data will inform the general discussion of parking supply and development, which can become highly contentious and emotional.

Jason Henderson, a San Francisco State University Geography Professor, said San Francisco Planning Commission hearings sometimes devolve into unhelpful arguments over the supply of parking without good data to back up either side's assertions.

The wounds inflicted by a nationwide loss never fully heal, but most presidential also-rans maintain their dignity and avoid any appearance of being sore losers.

In her attempt to shatter the glass ceiling, Secretary Clinton instead shattered the American tradition of being a good sport, of accepting one's failure with grace, and of teaching citizens that sometimes in losing we find an even deeper purpose.

For almost 30 years the Clintons have attempted to convince Americans that they are victims: of ""bimbos,"" of a ""vast right-wing conspiracy,"" of the White House staff, of the Department of Justice, of the Special Counsel. And now the HRC claim is that she was ""…on the way to winning until the combination of Jim Comey's letter on October 28 and the Russian WikiLeaks.""

Lying is quite an art form and one well practiced in politics. It is easy to lie in small ways to make things seem better, a practice that is often called ""spin."" Deft spinners find the words to confuse observers as to the actual sober reality of political decisions, especially ones that have developed an odor. But the real dark talent is to convince unsuspecting voters that what they think is true is actually the opposite.

The election results of 2016 were not a fluke. The American people were not confused and voters have the Clintons figured out. They know the Clintons have dragged the country through the back alley of 1960s excess. The Clintons are far too willing to put the country through the trauma and turbulence that results from their desire to grow their bank accounts in tandem with their political power.

Did Comey deny Hillary Clinton the White House? No. In fact, Clinton broke the law and mishandled classified information, a fact she continually swerves around.

Her top advisor, Huma Abedin, was married to an alleged child predator but she thought it acceptable to inappropriately send State Department information to her husband's laptop which he used for his leering sessions. Comey had already permanently damaged his reputation by publicly flogging Secretary Clinton for her abuse of sensitive information and for her failure to give consistently honest answers to the FBI, without recommending corresponding legal punishments. If anything, Director Comey aided and abetted the Clinton campaign and only went public with his actions when pushed by Congress or in response to the sleaziness of Weinergate.

To be even clearer, there would not have been any FBI investigation if Hillary Clinton had simply followed the law on the custody of her government emails and sensitive government information. What doomed her candidacy was a maniacal desire for personal secrecy and her belief that adherence to government standards were akin to Leona Helmsley's view of paying taxes, they are for ""the little people.""

UPDATE – 7th Oct: we have contacted TransLink regarding the RFEOI document source, which has been taken down and is currently unavailable on their website.

The South Coast British Columbia Transportation Authority (""TransLink"") has just recently released an RFEOI (Request for Expression of Interest) for the supply of new fully-automated vehicles for the SkyTrain system; the delivery of the new cars will coincide with the entrance of Evergreen Line service in 2016. View the document now:

Among the important details in this RFEOI are the initial purposes stated in PART A:

2.2 – TransLink intends to procure up to an initial 28 Vehicles (actual number of Vehicles may be increased or

decreased at TransLink's discretion), with potential options for up to an additional 28 Vehicles (actual

number of Vehicles may be increased or decreased at TransLink's discretion). The anticipated service

dates for the initial Vehicles is approximately January 2016, and June 2017 for optional Vehicles. 2.3 – Vehicles must be compatible with the existing SkyTrain infrastructure (guideways and stations), technology

(ALRT and Steerable Axle Trucks), propulsion power systems (Linear Induction Motors powered by 650

Volts DC), and SELTRAC automated train control system. Refer to the system overview provided in

Appendix 1 and Vehicle Dimensions listed in Appendix 2.

The deliveries of the initial 28 vehicle orders will coincide with the arrival of Evergreen Line SkyTrain service in 2016 and an additional 28 vehicles may enter service in 2017. It is conceivable that thew new vehicles will be using the newest Bombardier Innovia Metro 300 specification designed by Bombardier in 2010.

Among the interesting portions of the document and perhaps the most prominent is ""APPENDIX 2"", which details the technical specifications that the new vehicles must meet.

This portion of the document reveals important details about the configuration of the new trains. It specifies that there is a ""centre car"" (a vehicle insertion between two end vehicles) as well as that the number of cars in a basic unit is to equal 4. This points to the fact that while the individual vehicles themselves will be of simlar length, the new vehicles will be arranged in a 4-car articulated configuration which will be connected and walkable from end-to-end. If they were just married pairs, as with the current ART 200 configs, there wouldn't be any ""centre cars"" – they would all be ""end cars"". With TransLink is attempting to maximize per-train capacity, ensuring that all ART 200 (Mark II) trains operate with a 4-car configuration (2x 2-car married pair), this specification does make sense. Up to 56 of these new cars may be in service by summer of 2017.

At present there are only two other Bombardier Innovia ART systems in the world using 4-car long vehicles, being the implementations to exist in Beijing, China and Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.

It is highly likely that the new SkyTrain vehicles will be inserted into service on the busier Expo Line segments as opposed to the Evergreen Line, as it is planned that the Evergreen Line will begin service with 2-car configuration Mk II trains at 3 minute frequencies during the peak hours.

Curiously the vehicle dimension requirements outlined in the article have closer conformation to existing-generation ART 200 series SkyTrain cars. However, this should not forego the possibility of newest generation Bombardier Innovia Metro 300 cars being ordered (Innovia ART 300 spec sheet: see source 61). Metro 300 cars still confirm to these specs, but are also slightly shorter and lighter.

Under the Metro 300 specification, each car will carry 134 passengers with a 4 passengers/m2 passenger density or 185 passengers with a 6 passengers/m2 crush-load passenger density. Up to 740 (with a 6 passengers/m2 density) people can be carried per 4-car vehicle of this next generation of the SkyTrain fleet – and owing to the extra articulated sections between cars which can actually hold passengers themselves, this number may be higher so.

——————————————————————————

This choice will present some interesting opportunities for TransLink. The vehicles will be similar to the ART 200 configuration used on the newer generation SkyTrain cars of today, which are almost always used in a 4-car vehicle configuration. TransLink has an opportunity to add a 5th centre car to expand the new trains to a 5-car config.

A SkyTrain segment that can be expected to feature a headway of 75 seconds (the theoretical maximum possible headway) with exclusive use of 5-car variant ART 300 trains (i.e. the segment between Columbia and Waterfront Stations) has",0.362746027466772,0.662746027466772,-0.2,-0.1
257394,False,1024,"RFP issued for management coaching after article revealed that previous contract award was made in violation of trade laws

N

anaimo city officials quietly cancelled a widely publicized management training program after being embarrassed by aexposé, it emerged yesterday.

Officials failed to tell the public for nine weeks that the controversial program was scrapped due to the fallout over the article, which said the contract had been awarded in violation of trade laws because it wasn't put out for bids.

The article also revealed that one of the instructors the city was hiring ran a $500-per-night sexual empowerment retreat.

A news release on the city's website still says the program is proceeding, but yesterday the city issued a request for proposals (RFP) inviting other companies to bid on the contract.

At a closed-door meeting on Oct. 2, city manager Tracy Samra got councillors to approve the ""Constructive Culture through Self-Leadership"" training sessions for about 50 managers.

They awarded the contract to Coach Associates International, a home-based business operated by Vancouver Island University (VIU) business professor Dr. Steven Purse.

Two days later, Ms. Samra issued the news release about the program but didn't disclose how much the contract was worth. She said the program was meant to fix the city's toxic culture, and she was ""convinced that this is the path forward.""

However, on Saturday Oct. 7 of the Thanksgiving weekend News Nanaimo revealed that the city had violated the NewWest Partnership trade agreement because the contract was worth more than $75,000 but was not advertised for competitive bids.

The article also disclosed that Dr. Purse's partner in the program, Brad Switnicki, offered an apartment on Nanaimo's waterfront for rent as a ""sexually empowering retreat adventure.""

VIU president gets involved

The news caused embarrassment for not only city council, but was also a source of concern for senior executives at VIU.

Records obtained through a freedom of information request show that VIU's president Dr. Ralph Nilson emailed senior managers about the issue when he returned to work on the Tuesday morning following the long weekend.

The subject of his message was marked ""Confidential:Any questions re: VIU faculty and individual contract.""

Shelley Legin, the university's chief financial officer and vice-president of administration, then asked her communications manager Janina Stajic to ""please prepare for this and monitor social media.""

The records show that there were more than a dozen other emails that day, most raising concerns about information highlighted on Facebook showing a link from VIU's website to Dr. Purse's company website. That link was removed.

Meanwhile, at the city, councillors were irate when they were informed that Dr. Purse's company and the city would not be proceeding with their agreement.

It's not known who initiated the decision to cancel the contract.

Records show that when News Nanaimo later asked VIU if they had or would be taking action to distance the university from the contract, Ms. Stajic emailed her boss to say, ""PS if we aren't able to respond that is okay.""

The university never did answer any questions about the contract or its policies for freelance work by faculty.

No records kept

According to VIU's policy on outside employment activities, the president is required to keep a ""record of all regular employee's (sic) ongoing business interests and outside contracts of employment.""

However, in response to a freedom of information request for the records, VIU last week admitted there were none.

""We confirm that the VIU does not currently maintain a universal register of all employees' outside business interests. As we assume that this request is in relation to your recent published article concerning a consulting arrangement between a member of the Faculty of Management at VIU and the City of Nanaimo, we have also confirmed that this Faculty does not maintain such a master list,"" said the response.

Samra: ""Change will continue""

In its new RFP yesterday, the city said it was seeking proposals from ""qualified firms experienced in coaching, training and/or education to facilitate leadership and corporate culture change for City of Nanaimo management.""

The year-long contract will deliver coaching services to about 60 members of the city's management reporting directly or indirectly to Ms. Samra.

In an email to all staff this week, Ms. Samra said: ""I recognize the City of Nanaimo is going through some challenging times. We have been in a period of change management for two years. And, change will continue into the future.""

She said she had met with about 50 management staff to ""talk about a leadership and change management program.""

The plan was for the management group ""to lead us through corporate culture change",0.5320617313363727,0.7320617313363726,-0.2,0.0

New Street Station has been at the centre of public attention in recent times, with its extensive redevelopment works in full swing . However, at the heart of it, and often overlooked, sits the Grade II listed signal box on Navigation Street, which houses the centre of all rail operations of the station.

The corrugated concrete Brutalist structure may polarise public opinion, but is actually home of one of the city's most vital and intense infrastructure systems, serving the busiest rail interchange in the UK.

Designed by Bicknell & Hamilton and W.R. Healey and completed in 1965, the unapologetically bunker-like structure is an honest expression of its utilitarian function. Standing five storeys high above track level, the building gives no clue of the hive of activity that exists within its four walls.

The technology inside is of the same era as the exterior façade and was revolutionary for its time. The Relay Room sits just above street level and houses enormous banks of algorithmic electronic relays, known as Wespacs, which are programmed to calculate legal routes for the trains to take.

To maintain these systems, Network Rail engineers have to retain specialist knowledge of technology that is decades old. The long aisles of Wespacs are lit by incessantly flashing green and red lights and the extraordinary sound of thousands of relays clicking fills the room.

The top floor, or the Operational Floor, is reminiscent of the lair of a 1960s Bond villain. From their elevated perch a dedicated team operates 24/7, 365 days a year, and has done since the Signal Box opened.

Stood in front of a gigantic processing unit, which maps out the rail network with intertwining lines of LED lights and buttons, the team plan the routes for every train between Birmingham International and Wolverhampton.

Love it or hate it, signal boxes are soon to be a thing of the past. Over the next decade the signal boxes of the UK will be consolidated into centralised control centres where a single computer will control vast areas of track, a far cry from the ticking behemoths of the New Street Signal Box.

Thankfully, due its listed status, the humble concrete box on Navigation Street will remain a bastion for the romance of the railways, if only in spirit.

Our oceans have become so depleted of wild fish stocks, and so polluted with industrial contaminants, that trying to figure out the fish that are both safe and sustainable can make your head spin. ""Good fish"" lists can change year after year, because stocks rebound or get depleted every few years, but there are some fish that, no matter what, you can always decline.

The nonprofit Food & Water Watch looked at all the varieties of fish out there, how they were harvested, how certain species are farmed, and levels of toxic contaminants like mercury or PCBs in the fish, as well as how heavily local fishermen relied upon fisheries for their economic survival. These are the 12 fish, they determined, that all of us should avoid, no matter what.

See exactly what a sustainable fish is:

​

1. Imported catfish

Why it's bad: Nearly 90% of the catfish imported to the US comes from Vietnam, where use of antibiotics that are banned in the US is widespread. Furthermore, the two varieties of Vietnamese catfish sold in the US, Swai and Basa, aren't technically considered catfish by the federal government and therefore aren't held to the same inspection rules that other imported catfish are.

Eat this instead: Stick with domestic, farm-raised catfish, advises Marianne Cufone, director of the Fish Program at Food & Water Watch. It's responsibly farmed and plentiful, making it one of the best fish you can eat. Or, try Asian carp, an invasive species with a similar taste to catfish that's out-competing wild catfish and endangering the Great Lakes ecosystem.

2. Caviar

Why it's bad: Caviar from beluga and wild-caught sturgeon are susceptible to overfishing, according to the Food and Water Watch report, but the species are also being threatened by an increase in dam building that pollutes the water in which they live. All forms of caviar come from fish that take a long time to mature, which means that it takes a while for populations to rebound.

Eat this instead: If you really love caviar, opt for fish eggs from American Lake Sturgeon or American Hackleback/Shovelnose Sturgeon caviar from the Mississippi River system.

3. Atlantic cod

Advertisement - Continue Reading Below

Why it's bad: This one was difficult to add to the ""dirty dozen list,"" says Cufone, because it is so vital to the economic health of New England fishermen. ""However, chronic mismanagement by the National Marine Fisheries Service and low stock status made it very difficult to recommend,"" she says. Atlantic cod stocks collapsed in the mid-1990s and are in such disarray that the species is now listed as one step above endangered on the International Union for Conservation of Nature's Red List of Threatened Species.

Eat this instead: The good news, if you love fish 'n' chips (which is nearly always made with cod), is that Pacific cod stocks are still strong and are one of Food and Water Watch's best fish picks.

4. American eel

Why it's bad: Also called yellow or silver eel, this fish, which frequently winds up in sushi dishes, made its way onto the list because it's highly contaminated with PCBs and mercury. The fisheries are also suffering from some pollution and overharvesting.

Eat this instead: If you like the taste of eel, opt for Atlantic- or Pacific-caught squid instead.

5. Imported shrimp

Advertisement - Continue Reading Below

Why it's bad: Imported shrimp actually holds the designation of being the dirtiest of the ""dirty dozen,"" says Cufone, and it's hard to avoid, as 90% of shrimp sold in the U.S. is imported. ""Imported farmed shrimp comes with a whole bevy of contaminants: antibiotics, residues from chemicals used to clean pens, filth like mouse hair, rat hair, and pieces of insects,"" Cufone says. ""And I didn't even mention things like E. coli that have been detected in imported shrimp."" Part of this has to do with the fact that less than 2% of ALL imported seafood (shrimp, crab, catfish, or others) gets inspected before its sold, which is why it's that much more important to buy domestic seafood.

Donald Trump attends a Sunday service at First Christian Church in Council Bluffs, Iowa. (Photo: Jae C. Hong, AP)

If you're going to have a momentary misstep while attending a church service, being too quick to make an offering probably isn't a bad one to make.

Such was the case with Donald Trump at a Sunday service at First Christian Orchard Campus in Council Bluffs, Iowa, the Associated Press reports. When communion was passed to Trump, wife Melania, and two staffers in attendance, the GOP front-runner briefly mistook it for the offering plate and grabbed a number of bills from his pocket, according to AP.

""I thought it was for offering,"" he said with a chuckle to his staff, AP reports.

No harm done, though, as Trump later made a donation when the time came a few minutes later in the service.

Evangelicals have long been critical in Iowa's GOP caucuses, and as The Washington Post notes, Trump's efforts to court them haven't always gone swimmingly:

""Trump has made several efforts to woo evangelicals, including a recent visit to Liberty University in Virginia. There he was made fun of after he cited a Bible verse as being from ""Two Corinthians"" instead of ""Second Corinthians."" (Using ""Two Corinthians"" is common in Britain, and his mother is from Scotland.)""

As Trump left Sunday's service, AP notes that the church's pastor offered him a prayer ""that Jesus would guide his decisions.""

""Thank you,"" Trump said. ""I need that.""

255718,True,885,"Genocide according to The American Heritage Dictionary is defined as ""The deliberate destruction of an entire race or nation. The Holocaust conducted by the Nazis in Germany and the Rwandan genocide are examples of attempts at genocide.""


An upcoming report from the ""U.S. Holocaust Museum"" will clearly define the actions of ISIS against the Yezidi and other minorities as genocide. Which, according to several reports, will be followed by the Obama admiration designating the actions of ISIS as genocide, in a few weeks.


Should the United States declare the actions of ISIS genocide, then it requires the application of the UN convention against genocide, adopted in 1948. Unfortunately the UN convention is not specific on what that action should be. According to the convention:


""Article I: The Contracting Parties confirm that genocide, whether committed in time of peace or in time of war, is a crime under international law which they undertake to prevent and to punish""


This convention describes what genocide is and who may be punished, from heads of state to private individuals. It does not however give any indication as to the extent the world powers may go to prevent or how to punish. This was evident in the past as actions in Bosnia, Rwanda and Darfur were defined as genocide and some of the perpetrators were caught and punished, long after the fact.


With the exception of Darfur actions has been after the fact and even in Darfur the combined UN/African Union mission is too small to effectively protect civilians. Additionally while the International Criminal Court issued an arrest warrant for Sudanese President Omar Bashir it is unlikely to ever be served.


There is no doubt that what ISIS is doing is genocide, they have admitted it, in the case of the Yezidi that they intend to destroy the people and the culture. The questions now are, why it has it taken the world so long to come to this conclusion and what do they intend to do.


Now more than one year after the start of ISIS attacks into Iraq and the genocidal slaughter of the Yezidi, Christian, and Muslims who disagree, the US is prepared to declare it genocide. Then what? While the US did declare what happened in Darfur genocide a declassified State Department memo advised then Secretary of State Colin Powel that making ""a determination that genocide has occurred in Darfur would have no immediate legal--as opposed to moral, political or policy--consequences for the United States."" The determination was however the first time a US official had called an ongoing conflict genocide.


The administration is going to study the report for a few weeks before making a determination. The problem is that by doing so the White House and the State Department are concerned that by declaring ISIS is committing genocide what will this do to the US commitment to Iraq from a military standpoint. Unlike Darfur the United States has a political stake and military forces on the ground.


By failing to declare genocide and committing all available resources to the fight the US and the rest of the world is condoning the actions of one of the most barbaric organization that has infected the world in a long time. The preamble to the UN resolution, formally known as ""The Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide"" states ""in order to liberate mankind from such an odious scourge, international co-operation is required."" International co-operation cannot happen if each county is more concerned over internal politics or ideology then about the moral correctness of position.


The Kurdish Peshmerga with the help of the US and anti-ISIS international coalition have just liberated the town of Shingal which will protect the Yezidis and allow them to return to their homes, but it will not eliminate ISIS. To do so will require a full out assault by multi-national forces who will not give up until all vestiges of ISIS are gone. Until that time the scourge of genocide will continue to haunt mankind and the failure of all nations to rid us of it will render all conventions and treaty's calling for its end as meaningless pieces of paper.

255552,True,950,"The WHO is the world's leading health organisation guiding governments around the world. So we expect their advice to be up to date and evidence-based, particularly on controversial topics. One of the most controversial topics of our time is the international community's approach to drug policy, particularly that relating to the most popular so-called ""illegal"" drug – cannabis. Yet the WHO's advice on the harms and (lack of) benefits of cannabis is based on a decision made 82 years ago, by its predecessor, the League of Nations. Thankfully, there is now hope that this is about to change.

The WHO advises the UN, which states international control of drugs – so the view of the WHO really matters. The reality is that almost every country in the world (197 in total) sign up to follow WHO advice and so its current stance means punitive measures for cannabis – including lifetime in prison in some countries. Cannabis is still scheduled as having the highest level of harm and no medical value, despite reams of evidence to contrary. It is significantly less harmful than alcohol and shows real medical benefit, particularly in the treatment of pain, spasticity, and some forms of epilepsy. Due to these therapeutic effects, over 18 countries and over 200 million US citizens now have access to licensed medicinal cannabis. Consequently, the idea that cannabis isn't a medicine is considerably less plausible now than when this decision was made in 1934. Worse still, the actual report on which cannabis was scheduled in 1934 can no longer be found so it may be that the decades-long ban on cannabis is based on real errors of fact!

What is equally problematic is that the current legal status of cannabis means that research into its potential benefits – or harms - is really tough because of the regulations that accompany its Schedule 1 status. For example, in the UK medical researchers like me need a special license to hold cannabis for research though as a doctor I can prescribe heroin - a much more dangerous and sought-after drug. The UK government believes that it can't change this prohibitionist position and still comply with the UN conventions. This is untrue, as The Netherlands has demonstrated for over 30 years, but the easiest way to get a change in the UK policy would be if the WHO led the way.

It is vital that experts take all latest data into account during such a vital review, and to this end DrugScience has produced a detailed up-to-date assessment of cannabis for the public as well as the WHO and UN. This report authored by 4 experts – two from DrugScience - provides the vital background evidence on which a sensible modern re-assessment of cannabis can be made. This should lead to an appreciation that cannabis has medical value in some illnesses, and so encourage research into its potential for others, such as cancer, ADHD and PTSD. A proper review of cannabis could also encourage a more nuanced view of the comparative harms of different forms of cannabis, helping direct users away from the strong d9THC/low cannabidiol variants such as ""skunk"" that appear significantly different from more traditional herbal or resin forms of cannabis.

Big issues like this need that affect hundreds of millions of people across the globe need to determined based on the best and most current evidence available. Leading organisations such as the WHO and UN need to be able to move quickly to try and avoid the public losing out.

At last there has been some progress! This came from the recent meeting of the WHO Expert Committee on Drug Dependence in the WHO headquarters in Geneva. Here the Expert Committee and the WHO Lead for Medicines, Dr Suzanne Hill, were presented with the report by the DrugScience team. They also heard powerful supporting arguments from two other expert groups (the International Drug Policy Consortium and the International Association for Hospice & Palliative Care) both of whom also made it clear that there was a pressing need for a review of cannabis scheduling.

The DrugScience team argued that the Expert Committee had the right to change its agenda to start a full pre-review of cannabis immediately based on our WHO-standard report. This they declined to do, but it seems our arguments were heeded as an official pre-review has been ordered, to be completed before the next meeting of the Commission on Narcotic Drugs in 2018.

This move by the WHO is encouraging as its perception as being an evidence-based health organisation has become seriously questioned by its failure to consider the evolving facts on cannabis. It is critical that the review they conduct is honest, transparent and fully evidence-based; for surely then it will be impossible for the UN to continue to argue that cannabis should be scheduled as being extremely harmful and lacking medical value!",0.7962224827019933,0.7962224827019933,0.0,0.0

256939,False,1024,"It is not a matter of being optimistic or pessimistic, knowing or not knowing elementary things, of being responsible or not for events. Those who would like to be thought of as politicians should be thrown onto the trash heap of history when, as the norm goes, they have no idea about everything or almost everything related to it in that activity.

Of course I am not speaking about those who throughout the various millennia turned public affairs into instruments of power and wealth for the privileged classes, an activity where the real records of cruelty have been imposed during the last eight or ten thousand years about those we have certain traces of the social behaviour of our species, whose existence as thinking beings, according to scientists, barely covers 180,000 years.

It is not my purpose to get involved in such topics that would surely bore almost one hundred percent of the people continuously being bombarded with news across the media, going from the written word to three-dimensional images that are starting to be shown in expensive cinemas. The day is not far away when they shall also predominate in the already fabulous television images per se. It is no accident that the so-called leisure industry has its headquarters in the heart of the empire that tyrannizes everybody.

What I would like to do is to rest on the current starting point of our species to speak of the march towards the abyss. I might even speak of an ""inexorable"" march and I would certainly be closer to reality. The idea of a Last Judgement is implicit in the most practiced religious doctrines among the inhabitants of this planet, without anyone classifying them for that as being pessimistic. On the contrary, I think it is a basic duty of all serious and sane persons, who number in the millions, to fight to postpone and perhaps to prevent that dramatic and imminent event in today's world.

Numerous dangers threaten us, but two of them, nuclear war and climate change, are decisive and both are ever farther away from coming close to a solution.

Verbose demagoguery, the statements and speeches of the tyranny imposed upon the world by the United States and its powerful and unconditional allies, on both topics, do not admit the slightest doubt in that respect.

January 1st of 2012, the western and Christian New Year, coincides with the anniversary of the triumph of the Revolution in Cuba and the year celebrating the 50th anniversary of the October Crisis of 1962 that put the world on the brink of a nuclear world war and this forces me to write these lines.

My words would be lacking in meaning if they had the objective of blaming on the American people, or on any other country which is an ally of the United States in the unusual adventure; they, like all the other peoples of the world, would be the inevitable victims of the tragedy. Recent events happening in Europe and elsewhere show massive indignation by those who are led to protest by the unemployment, shortages, reductions in their incomes, debts, discrimination, lies and politicking and lead to brutal repressions by the guardians of established law and order.

With growing frequency one speaks of military technologies that affect the entire planet, the only satellite known to be inhabitable hundreds of light years away from any other that may perhaps be suitable if we were to move at the speed of light, three hundred thousand kilometres per second.

We should not ignore that if our marvellous thinking species should disappear, many millions of years would go by before another one capable of thinking would arise, by virtue of the natural principles that rule as a consequence of the evolution of the species, discovered by Darwin in 1859 and which today is acknowledged by all serious scientists, whether they are religious or not.

No other era in the history of mankind has known the dangers that today humanity faces. Persons like me, at 85 years old, had reached our 18th birthdays with high school graduation degrees before the first atomic bomb had been put together.

Today artefacts of this type, ready to be used – incomparably more powerful than those that produced the heat of the sun over the cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki─ add up to thousands.

Weapons of this kind that are kept in storage, added to those already deployed by virtue of agreements, reach figures that surpass twenty thousand nuclear missiles.

The use of just one hundred or so of those weapons would be enough to create nuclear winter that would cause a horrible death in a short time for all the human beings living on the planet, as the American scientist and Rutgers University professor Alan Robock has brilliantly explained along with computerized data.

Those used to reading news and serious international analyses know how the risks of the outbreak of war with the use of nuclear weapons increase as the tension grows in the Middle East, where in the hands of the Israeli government hundreds of combat-ready nuclear weapons are accumulated, and whose nature as a strong nuclear power is neither admitted or denied.

It's 7 p.m. in the Toronto airport, and after a grueling day of doing press at the film festival, Wolverine himself—Hugh Jackman—is going through security. No claws. Check. Many fans. Check.

Jackman not only breezes through security, but stops to shake every hand and take pictures with fans ranging from age 10 to 80. ""These are the people who put me where I am today,"" says Jackman, who's been married to Australian actress Deborra-Lee Furness since 1996. ""I love getting out there and meeting the people.""

How nice is Hugh Jackman? Two hours later, the woman sitting next to me on the plane back to the West Coast has a dreamy look in her eye and shows me her iPhone. ""I was buying magazines and ran into Hugh Jackman!"" she gushes. ""He even took a picture with me.""

YourTango: What's your secret to having one of the best marriages in this business?

Hugh Jackman: You love each other—and respect each other. You truly want to be together.

YourTango: Does your wife have any major house rules?

Hugh Jackman: My wife says whenever anyone says to me, 'Hey, Hugh, you're looking kind of stylish' then that's the time I have to say, 'Oh, that's my wife.' She told me, 'Honey, I don't need a lot of applause, but I do need it in the style department.'

YourTango: That's hilarious.

Hugh Jackman: My wife told me if she ever reads me saying, 'Yeah, I really love fashion. I know what to wear' then she will slap me around!

YourTango: How did you know Deb was The One?

Hugh Jackman: I think you just know. There isn't a question mark there.

YourTango: What is your best parenting advice? Your daughter Ava is now 8 and son Oscar is 13. What is life like at Chez Jackman?

Hugh Jackman: My best parenting advice is to give you no advice. The only parents who give advice are the ones who are not parents yet. Don't trust the advice. Just do it.

YourTango: Does your wife keep things centered when you're filming?

Hugh Jackman: She's the greatest. I'm one of the lucky ones. She's very wise, a great actress, and a great wife and mother. Did you see her host ""The View?"" She does it all. I'm really proud of her.

YourTango: We all know you're Wolverine. What power would you like to have in real life?

Hugh Jackman: Definitely teleporting. I'm always on planes. I'm one of those people who pack too much into life and the traveling gets really tiring. It would be nice to teleport myself home every night, walk the dog, and then go to sleep with my kids in the next rooms and my wife next to me. Heaven.

YourTango: Switching gears, what was it like to work with Jake Gyllenhaal in your new movie Prisoners? It's one of the best films of the year.

Hugh Jackman: I loved working with Jake. I think you can see it in the movie. We're lone wolves and their relationship is really important to the story. We only have four or five scenes together and wanted to make the most of those. As actors, none of us really wanted to leave the scene. We wanted to dive in and investigate.

YourTango: As a father, how difficult was it to do a movie about a missing child?

Hugh Jackman: It was gut wrenching. I read something from a father ... the most howling part is knowing your child is waiting for you and can't understand why you're not there. The police say, 'Let us do our job.' It's maddening to think you can't do anything and you're failing your child. It's hard to comprehend.

YourTango: On a much lighter note, are you the coolest dad around because you're Wolverine?

Hugh Jackman: My kids are used to seeing me with the long Wolverine hair and hair on my face. I've been playing the role since before my son was born and now he's 13. The difference is now the kids are interested in it. Last summer, my son wanted to see my new movie The Wolverine. It was summer vacation and he's 13. My son had to wake up at 6:15 a.m. and not 10 a.m. He did this voluntarily. Trust me, at this age, you wait for the kids",0.0,0.773863784968853,-3.5,-0.1

256743,False,1024,"9 Questions That Stump Every Pro-Vaccine Advocate and Their Claims found its way onto the Facebook page for the Winnipeg Skeptics when a member's friend posted it, along with the qualification ""if you can give me a good, scientifically-backed answer to each of these questions, I will vaccinate my children."" Oh, if it only were all so easy! The article claims:

I have never encountered one pro-vaccine advocate, whether medically or scientifically qualified, who could answer even 1 let alone all 9 of these questions.

Well, here's one non-immunologist, non-virologist, unqualified physiology & medical student who had zero problem with finding scientific answers to any of their questions. Let's dive right in, shall we?

1. Could you please provide one double-blind, placebo-controlled study that can prove the safety and effectiveness of vaccines?


Prophylactic quadrivalent human papillomavirus (types 6, 11, 16, and 18) L1 virus-like particle vaccine in young women: a randomised double-blind placebo-controlled multicentre phase II efficacy trial Yes, although you can't find any modern studies of old vaccines, because it's unethical to deviate from the standard of care. However, there are tons of modern (i.e. internet searchable) literature on the subject. Honestly, go to Google Scholar and search ""double blind placebo vaccine"" I'll start you off:

2. Could you please provide scientific evidence on ANY study which can confirm the long-term safety and effectiveness of vaccines?

Yes. Seriously, it took me 30 seconds to find this. Google Scholar is your friend.

3. Could you please provide scientific evidence which can prove that disease reduction in any part of the world, at any point in history was attributable to inoculation of populations?

4. Could you please explain how the safety and mechanism of vaccines in the human body are scientifically proven if their pharmacokinetics (the study of bodily absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion of ingredients) are never examined or analyzed in any vaccine study?

You can't study the pharmacokinetics of something which is not physically acting on the body—rather, vaccines are designed to be acted upon. I can't answer this; not because of a conspiracy, but because this is an unanswerable question. It's like asking, ""Why haven't they studied the mating habits of tennis shoes?""

5. Could you please provide scientific justification as to how injecting a human being with a confirmed neurotoxin is beneficial to human health and prevents disease?

Neurotoxins are a matter of dosage, just like radiation, and all interventions are a risk-benefit ratio. You accept the risk of getting a chest x-ray if you might have pneumonia because the dose is very low, and you won't have it done repeatedly. Also, for something to be a neurotoxin and have effects on the brain, it must be able to pass the blood-brain barrier. This is very, very difficult and chemists spend their entire lives trying to design something that will get across. Just because something can be toxic doesn't mean it is, just because something has risk doesn't mean it's not worth doing, and just because something has theoretical potential to do harm doesn't mean that it will do harm.

‎6. Can you provide a risk/benefit profile on how the benefits of injecting a known neurotoxin exceeds its risks to human health for the intended goal of preventing disease?

See the above study on measles vaccines saving hundreds of thousands of lives . Any risk of ""injecting a known neurotoxin"" (Which one? At what dose? Neurotoxic to who? Correlation or causative?) is unequivocally lower than the very real and potentially lethal risk of an outbreak in an unvaccinated community or one with a low uptake.

7. Could you please provide scientific justification on how bypassing the respiratory tract (or mucous membrane) is advantageous and how directly injecting viruses into the bloodstream enhances immune functioning and prevents future infections?

Different parts of your body have different types of antibodies associated with them. In the mucous membranes of your body, like the GI tract and the respiratory tract, white blood cells at the membrane produce IgA antibodies on exposure to a pathogen. In the blood stream, you have direct access to the memory cells which produce IgGs: the more robust antibodies that provide lifetime immunity against a particular pathogen. Those memory cells will stay in your lymph nodes, ready to produce an onslaught of deadly (to the pathogen) IgGs whenever the body recognizes it again. IgAs are incapable of this, and many respiratory pathogens are defeated after exposure by the body's initial defences, before an specific set of antibodies can ever be manufactured.

8. Could you please provide scientific justification on how a vaccine would prevent viruses from mutating?

""Did You Just Assume My Gender?"" is a punchline used to mock the sensitivity of feminists, Social Justice Warriors, and the discussions going on in the LGBTQ community, particularly the Trans and Queer communities, involving gender identification.

Origin

In online discussions, a vocal community of people who identified as genderqueer or genderfluid (neither a boy or girl) grew on Tumblr and certain subreddits as part of Social Justice Blogging and increased awareness surrounding gender issues. ""Did You Just Assume My Gender?"" first appeared as a punchline mocking the supposedly militant nature of feminists and queer activists in a May 1st, 2016 post on Imgur by JCMorrowx.


Spread

""Did You Just Assume My Gender?"" soon became a punchline associated with Triggered memes and social justice warriors. On May 29th, 2016, a thread on Reddit's /r/OutofTheLoop asked ""What's with people and their gender identities lately?"" The top comment read:

""The gist of it is that once transgender people started to become more socially acceptable, it suddenly became cool (on tumblr at least) to pretend you were transgender or at the very least not bound to just one gender. As a result, certain people started to state the pronouns they wished to be assigned to them (i.e.ce/cir/cirs/cirself instead of he/him/his/himself) and lead to people complaining about being refered to as male or female.""

Over the course of the summer, ""Did You Just Assume My Gender?"" jokes trended on 9gag and ifunny. Another thread on /r/OutOfTheLoop appeared on August 24th, this time asking ""Where did Did you just assume my gender? come from?""

Following the tweet, several Twitter users accused the @CyberpunkGame feed of using a transphobic joke, while others argued the joke was not transphobic (shown below).


On August 21st, the @CyberpunkGame feed posted an apology for the tweet, stating that ""harming anyone was never our intention"" (shown below).

258307,True,969,"Yes, a lot of the issues with the keyboard remain. It's narrow, tightly spaced and otherwise not the best keyboard BlackBerry has ever made. (To me, that honor goes to the Bold 9900.) Also, a slider design on a large 5.4-inch phone creates a unique problem: It's so tall in its extended mode that I occasionally had to hold it close to me to avoid banging against nearby objects. For that matter, the software autocorrect would sometimes fail to kick in while I was using the physical keyboard, leaving me to correct typos like it was 2006 all over again.

But when everything works, it works. It's not so much the speed -- it's not that much faster than using a touchscreen keyboard -- as the feel and how it frees up screen space. There's something satisfying about flicking out the keyboard to wake the phone and dash off a message. And hiding the software keyboard is just perfect for chat apps like Hangouts, where all that newly freed-up real estate lets me track more of the conversation without scrolling. Although the on-screen keyboard is well-done, I found myself leaning toward the old-school buttons when I had the chance.

Part of the appeal comes when I do have to scroll, mind you. The keyboard's gesture support is inconsistent, even within apps (Flickr reverses scrolling directions in different sections, for instance), but on the whole it's very useful. I can read an article without obscuring the page, or follow the strands of a long Twitter conversation without lifting my hands off the keys. While I didn't use the other features much (such as selecting text or erasing whole words), they were nice to have now and then. These gestures were also present on the Passport, of course, but it's still great to have them here too, especially when there's a rich app ecosystem that can take advantage of those keyboard swipes.

How does the rest of the Priv stack up, you ask? Pretty well, actually. The quad HD display and 18-megapixel camera remain good but not great, and the battery life with heavy use (e.g., social networking and music streaming) is merely average despite the big 3,410mAh battery. However, the phone could almost always keep up with what I wanted to do. The Snapdragon 808 chip and 3GB of RAM aren't as powerful as you'll get in some phones in this class, but they're still up to the job of driving a flagship device. About the only let-down was the low-light photography, which was reasonably bright but also noisy and colorless (though it did get better, as you'll see below). You could never touch the Priv's keyboard and still get a pretty solid smartphone.

And yes, moving to Android has done wonders for the BlackBerry experience. As good as a few elements of BlackBerry 10 were -- multitasking in particular -- it's refreshing to have an ample supply of native apps, instead of repackaged titles or, more often, nothing at all. Instagram? Flickr? Swarm? Yes to all of them. BlackBerry's custom touches are generally welcome, too, like pop-up widgets and stars to indicate apps with notifications. Some of the software is superfluous outside of certain business users; I didn't really need DTEK's security audits, for instance. All the same, I'd say BlackBerry struck a fine balance between maintaining Android's strong points and catering to faithful users.

I'd add that BlackBerry has been good about supporting the Priv in the time I've used it. A major December update improved performance across the board, including the camera's low-light quality. On top of that, there have been numerous app updates to tweak the functionality and fix bugs. It's still not flawless: One recent crash forced me to reboot the phone. However, this is the kind of tremendous post-launch support that I wish other phone manufacturers would offer. That extra level of care stems partly from make-or-break necessity (BlackBerry may quit hardware entirely if sales remain poor), but it's greatly appreciated.

My main concern is that the Priv isn't quite as transformative an experience as BlackBerry arguably needs it to be. I did get hooked on typing on that hardware keyboard, but I felt back at home the moment I went back to typing on glass with other phones. The physical keys weren't so addictive that I found myself missing them dearly, and that's a problem when rivals like the Galaxy Note 5 and Nexus 6P are faster, take better photos and otherwise sport more bells and whistles. Even so, I'm going to miss the Priv -- and that's something I haven't said about a BlackBerry in a long time.",0.7245924103375341,0.7245924103375341,0.0,0.0

258067,False,1024,"Following hate attacks, mayor of Seattle delivered his 'state of the city' address at a mosque, vowing to stand for rights of all residents

Seattle Mayor Ed Murray speaks out against the travel ban at a rally in Seattle on 29 January 2017 (AFP)

The welcoming signs hung on the fence went all around the corner lot: ""We love our Muslim neighbours."" ""Thank you for enriching our community."" ""You are loved and welcome."" ""Our [Jewish] family is so happy you are here, at home.""

The mayor of Seattle was giving his ""state of the city"" address at a mosque.

'Seattleites are building community. We are spreading our arms, and opening our hearts' - Mayor Ed Murray

Looking up, one saw the architectural elegance of the Idriss Mosque, the oldest traditional-style mosque in the US west of the Mississippi river. This was the North Seattle venue that mayor Ed Murray had chosen for his annual speech, a departure from the usual locale, in downtown City Hall.

The handmade signs had gone up weeks earlier, in protest at President Donald Trump's Islamophobic policies, including the executive order banning refugees and immigrants from seven majority-Muslim countries.

As the crowd trickled in, past a heavy police presence, metal detectors and a checkpoint that many said reminded them of airport security, attendees were welcomed again, this time by Hisham Farahallah, the secretary of the Idriss Mosque Board of Trustees, who thanked people for attending the event.

""By gracing us here, you have touched the hearts of Muslims across the nation,"" he said. Farahallah introduced Murray, who opened his address with a note of empowerment, vowing not to be demoralised by the bleakness of the national political scene.

'For the soul of America'

Citing racist and xenophobic precedents to the current Islamophobic climate in the country, from the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 to the Japanese internment during the second World War, Murray said, ""We are here because we are a welcoming city. We stand in solidarity with our Muslim neighbours.""

Murray was bluntly critical of Trump, explaining that ""the next four years [of Trump's Administration] will be a battle for the soul of America"". But the mayor also sounded optimistic about his city, as he observed that ""in contrast to the president's politics of polarisation, Seattleites are building community. We are spreading our arms, and opening our hearts"".

If necessary we'll go to court to get answers on @POTUS Trump's unclear immigration order & threats against cities. https://t.co/tworAwST9Q pic.twitter.com/lIa6IXBZfq — Ed Murray (@MayorEdMurray) February 21, 2017

Murray touched on many topics, from homelessness to wage disparity to police accountability and public education, but he kept coming back to what he described as a ""fundamental value of this city,"" namely ""remaining open to all"".

The decision to give the ""state of the city"" address at a mosque was announced on 13 February, after three reported Islamophobic attacks in the area.

While Seattle is seen as one of the more liberal cities in the US, it has not been totally immune to the hostile national climate. Two mosques have recently been vandalised in the Seattle area.


Residents hung welcoming signs around the mosque (Nada Elia/ MEE) The Muslim Association of Puget Sound (MAPS) in Redmond, an eastern suburb of Seattle, was attacked twice, the first time in late November 2016, and the second time in December 2016, immediately after the repairs from the first incident were completed. No suspects were arrested, even as police investigated both attacks as hate crimes.

In January 2017, the Islamic Center of the Eastside, also known as ""the Bellevue Masjid,"" just outside of Seattle, was engulfed in forty-foot flames that badly damaged the building in confirmed arson. Police arrested Isaac Wayne Wilson, a 37-year old local white man who had previous disruptive contacts with the mosque.

Sanctuary city

Seattle is one of the few ""sanctuary cities"" in the country that have openly defied Trump's anti-immigration policies. The designation ""sanctuary city"" was first used in the US in 1979, in Los Angeles, California. While the designation does not carry a legal meaning, sanctuary cities do not inquire about a resident's immigration status before dispensing services, and usually forbid their police from inquiring about a person's immigration status or share such information with immigration enforcement.

Research on how bacteria adapt to changing environments underlies the contemporary biological understanding of signal transduction (ST), and ST provides the foundation of the information-processing approach that is the hallmark of the 'cognitive revolution,' which began in the mid-20th century. Yet cognitive scientists largely remain oblivious to research into microbial behavior that might provide insights into problems in their own domains, while microbiologists seem equally unaware of the potential importance of their work to understanding cognitive capacities in multicellular organisms, including vertebrates. Evidence in bacteria for capacities encompassed by the concept of cognition is reviewed. Parallels exist not only at the heuristic level of functional analogue, but also at the level of molecular mechanism, evolution and ecology, which is where fruitful cross-fertilization among disciplines might be found.

The review is organized into two parts. Part 1 provides an introduction to the study of cognition. Part 2 sets out a proposed bacterial cognitive toolkit. Because there is a great deal of ground to cover, and not a lot of space to cover it in, the mechanisms of how systems work will be sketched in broad outline, not in detail, except in those cases where the details are either not widely known or not easily accessible in the literature. The aim here is to stimulate microbiologists to think about their work in the broader context of a cognitive biology ( Kovác, 2000 ; Auletta, 2011 ; Bechtel, 2014 ; Fitch, 2014 ) and to consider designing experiments to explicitly enhance this understanding.

In the hope of stimulating interest among microbiologists in this area, this review brings together contemporary evidence for cognition in eubacteria in core areas of cognitive research: sensory ST, valence, communication, sensorimotor coordination, memory, learning, anticipation, and decision making in complex and changing circumstances. The article will show that parallels exist not only at the heuristic level of functional analog, but also at the level of molecular mechanism, evolution and ecology, which is where fruitful cross-fertilization among disciplines might be found. Archaea, whose behavior is less well documented and appear (so far) to possess far fewer ST systems than bacteria ( Ulrich and Zhulin, 2010 ), will not be discussed here.

Yet, while work on bacterial adaptation underlies the contemporary biological understanding of sensory ST ( Wadhams and Armitage, 2004 ), and ST in turn provides the foundation of the information-processing approach to cognition that (rightly or wrongly) remains the hallmark of the 'cognitive revolution' ( Miller, 2003 ), cognitive scientists are largely oblivious to research in this and other areas of microbial behavior that might provide insights into problems in their own domains. For example, some flagellated bacterial species, paradigmatically Escherichia coli, have been found to possess large clusters of interacting sensory receptors, typically at the leading pole of the cell, which function as complex information-processing units linked to motor activity ( Hazelbauer et al., 2007 ) and have been dubbed by some a 'nanobrain' ( Webre et al., 2003 ). Meanwhile, microbiologists seem equally unaware of the potential importance of their work to understanding cognitive capacities in metazoans including vertebrates.

The idea that microbes might know their world, not merely bump into it, is controversial but unoriginal. At the beginning of the 20th century, Jennings (1905/1962 ) claimed the behavior of the 'lower animals,' notably paramecia but including bacteria, could tell us much about the behavior of the 'higher animals,' including humans. The Animal Mind ( Washburn, 1936 ), the first US textbook on comparative psychology (first edition 1908), begins with amoeba. Biochemist Daniel Koshland provided the modern scientific equivalent of Jennings' argument in an under-appreciated monograph on bacterial chemotaxis (CT) as a model system for the study of behavior, and remarked (following Pope) that ""the proper study of mankind is the bacterium"" ( Koshland, 1980b ). Philosopher of science Karl Popper went further and argued (only slightly tongue-in-cheek) that in the evolution of problem-solving ""from the amoeba to Einstein is just one step"" ( Popper, 1999 ).

Introduction

Wherever you are from, it is probable that you eat tomatoes in one form or another. Tomatoes originated in South America but are now found all over the world. Without tomatoes we would have no cheese and tomato pizza; no ketchup; no baked beans on toast; no lasagne or spaghetti Bolognese; no tomato soup; no BLTs; no mozzarella, tomato, and basil salad; no tomato gazpacho; no tuna nicoise; no salsa; and no tomatoes with our fried breakfast--or any of the other hundreds of dishes that use this savoury fruit. (Although often thought of as a vegetable, tomatoes are technically a fruit. They contain the seeds from which new tomatoes plants will grow.)

Wild Tomatoes

Tomatoes are thought to have first grown in western South America, in the region of modern day Peru and Ecuador. Wild species are still found in these areas as well as farther south in Chile and Bolivia. Tomato plants are found in all sorts of environments from the deserts and dry valleys on the Western slopes of the Andes to fog-saturated cloud forests and even above the snowline on the Andean mountains. However, most wild species prefer dry conditions.

Very varied in size, colour, and appearance, most wild tomatoes don't look anything like those you would buy in a shop. They are usually about a centimetre across, green in colour, and covered with fur. What's more, their taste can be distinctly bitter and unpleasant. Which of these wild tomatoes (if any) gave rise to the modern tomato is not certain, but it probably developed from the species Solanum pimpinellifolium, which looks and tastes most like the tomatoes we are used to.

Domestication of the Tomato

At one decisive moment in the history of the tomato, someone decided to plant and grow tomatoes rather than picking them in the wild. This was the very first tomato farmer and with that move the future of the tomato was changed forever. When or where this first happened we will never know for sure. Some people have guessed tomatoes were first grown in Peru and Ecuador (around where the tomato originated thousands of years ago). This area was home to many complex civilisations, culminating in the Incas, but no evidence has yet been found that any of them farmed tomatoes. Others have suggested that tomatoes were first cultivated by humans in Mexico--around 4000 miles to the north. Certainly by the 1500s, when Europeans first arrived in Mexico, the native peoples had long been growing tomatoes for food.

Wherever it first happened, when people started farming the tomato it would have looked much like it did in the wild. However, each time they picked their tomatoes they could use the seed from the best ones (e.g. the biggest or the sweetest) to sow more tomato plants. By selecting the best tomatoes to grow, they grew plants with better and better tomatoes. This process of changing a wild plant into one that is good for humans is called domestication and it is how wild tomatoes began to change into the tomatoes we eat today.

Spread of the Tomato

Well before the 1500s the tomato plant had already travelled 4000 km north, from its origin in the Andean region of modern day Peru and Ecuador to Mexico. It may have been that tomato plants were deliberately transported north to Mexico by humans or that after eating tomatoes birds or other animals carried the seeds there in their stomachs .

In 1492, Columbus made his first landfall in the New World. This was to change the future of the tomato, as it led to the Spanish exploration and conquest of the Americas, their discovery of the tomato plant, and the eventual spread of the tomato to all four corners of the earth.

The first tomato plants to be taken to Europe probably came from Mexico, the site of the Aztec capital Tenochtitlan, which was conquered by the Spanish conquistador Cortes in 1519. Here the Spanish discovered the Aztecs eating a domesticated form of the tomato that they referred to as Xitomatl. Bernardino Sahagun, a Franciscan priest who visited Mexico in 1529, wrote that the Aztecs combined tomatoes with chillies and ground squash seeds to make a sauce [or salsa]. Salsa made with tomatoes and chillies is still a popular relish in Mexico and the USA today. To find modern recipes for the tomato, including salsa, click here .

It is likely that tomatoes first arrived in Europe via some Spanish port. However, the first record we have of tomatoes in Europe appears in the 1544 work of an Italian herbalist called Matthioli. The tomato that Matthioli studied was around the size of a fist and a bright yellow colour so he called the tomato ""pomi d' oro"", or ""Golden Apple"". The tomato and the name 'Golden apple' spread quickly north through Europe. Tomatoes were",0.0,0.8066894915841875,-2.0,0.0

A huge toxic algae bloom in Utah has closed one of the largest freshwater lakes west of the Mississippi river, sickening more than 100 people and leaving farmers scrambling for clean water during some of the hottest days of the year.

The bacteria commonly known as blue-green algae has spread rapidly to cover almost all of 150-square-mile Utah Lake, turning the water bright, anti-freeze green with a pea soup texture and leaving scummy foam along the shore.

""It smells like something is rotting,"" said Jason Garrett, water quality director for the Utah County health department. ""We don't have an idea of how long this event will last.""

US west coast toxic algae bloom might be largest ever, say scientists Read more

Toxic algae is a problem around the country. An enormous outbreak in Florida is now fouling beaches on the east coast, and a 2014 outbreak at Lake Erie left more than 400,000 people in the Toledo area without tap water for two days.

Utah Lake doesn't provide drinking water, but its closure is causing big problems for people who use the lake for swimming, fishing and other activities, and for farmers with thirsty crops.

Utah poison control says it has fielded hundreds of calls related to the bloom, including 130 involving people who have reported vomiting, diarrhea, headache and rashes.

The contamination has now spread to the Jordan river, which supplies irrigation to dozens of farmers around Salt Lake City, about 45 miles north of the lake. The problem has occurred amid days of triple-digit temperatures as growers prepare for farmers markets and try to nurture crops such as corn and fruit trees at key points in their development.

""We've spent hundreds of thousands of dollars on this crop, maxed out every dollar we have,"" said Luke Petersen, who farms about 100 acres of tomatoes, summer squash and other produce in Riverton. ""We're real worried about it.""

Meanwhile, the Bonneville School of Sailing has had to cancel more than a dozen groups since the lake was closed.

""This will be a real hit,"" said co-owner Todd Frye. He loves the mountain-rimmed lake and has worked to change the decades-old perception that it's murky and polluted. New efforts to clean out bottom-feeding carp are improving the water quality, but he worries the algae bloom will be a blow to its image.

The lake is largely fed by treated wastewater as well as agricultural runoff, said Erica Gaddis, assistant director for the Utah division of water quality.

Longstanding drought conditions have made the water especially low and stagnant. Combine that with hot summer weather and Utah Lake became a perfect petri dish for the cyanobacteria.

There are chemical and biological treatments for the problem, but using them on such a large bloom would be unprecedented and possibly harmful, Gaddis said.

For now, authorities are waiting for the bloom to run its course and clear, hopefully aided by a drop in temperatures or a storm that could stir up the water and reduce stagnation.

One bit of good news is that early test results indicate levels of dangerous toxins produced by the bacteria may not be as high as feared, though the state is still waiting for more data.

To stave off new blooms in coming years, the state is looking to reduce the levels of toxic algae-feeding phosphorous and nitrogen in wastewater that's pumped into the lake. That could be difficult, however, because cities served by those plants include some of the fastest-growing in the nation.

""We've been loading the Utah Lake in one form or another for 150 years, and it's catching up with us,"" Gaddis said.",0.5925527396222625,0.7925527396222625,-0.2,0.0
256156,True,474,"The latest release of Australian unemployment data has largely caught economists, and by extension the market, sharply by surprise.

In fact, rather than coming in at the forecasted 5.9% the unemployment rate actually declined to 5.7% in April. Subsequently, the labor market appears to be going through resurgence but just how robust the current gains are remains to be seen, Economic Calendar reported.

The employment change figures for April showed a gain of around 37.4k jobs, which followed on from a rise of 60k in March. Obviously, this is a welcome strengthening of the labor market and should lead to some inflationary gains over the medium term. However, the headline rate was a little less impressive with full time positions declining by nearly 11.6k in April. Subsequently, the rise in part-time employment is a relatively concerning trend in the Australian economy.

In fact, the total hours worked metric declined by around 0.3% whilst part time employment has risen by over 111,300 positions in the past year. This all highlights the underlying reasons why the unemployment rate and job gain figures can be somewhat misleading. It also goes some of the way to explaining why there has been little in the way of systemic inflation over the past year, despite some strong gains in the employment numbers.

However, despite the employment figures being somewhat unreliable as a macroeconomic indicator, the results are likely to be noticed by the Reserve Bank of Australia. In fact, there is a view that the recent gains may actually see the central bank delaying a potential cut to interest rates given the risk of inflationary pressures arriving down the line.

Subsequently, the next RBA meeting is likely to see the central bank holding rates at 1.50% for the tenth consecutive meeting. Lending further support to this view is the increasing domestic debt levels, largely to do with the housing bubble, that the central bank are very clearly concerned with. Subsequently, cutting rates further, and by extension, providing a looser credit environment is likely to not be particularly high on the RBA's agenda.

Ultimately, although the falling unemployment rate is likely to be relatively welcome news to the Australian public, It hides deeper issues around the appropriateness of part time employment and what impact this will have on inflation in the medium term.",0.6903361199501046,0.6903361199501046,0.0,0.0

The charges, often called outsourcing fee, had forced Indian IT companies in the last few years to pay millions of dollars towards protecting the US-Mexican border from illegal immigration.


Indian firms had described the fee on highly-qualified IT professionals coming to the US on a H-1B visa as ""discriminatory.""


The legislation with regard to a USD 2,000 fee on H-1B visas for companies having more than 50 per cent of its employees oversees was adopted by the US Congress in 2010 mainly at the instance of a group of lawmakers led by Senator Charles Schumer.


Passed on August 10, the law contains provision to hike H-1B and L-1 Visa fee per application by USD 2,000 and USD 2,250 respectively for qualifying firm; which mainly targeted Indian IT companies.


The duration of law was extended from four to five years under James Zadroga 9/11 Health and Compensation Act of 2010 to provide healthcare and financial compensation for the firefighters and other 'First Responders' who helped out in the aftermath of the 9/11 attack.


In a report released last month, NASSCOM said Indian tech industry contributed an estimated over USD 375 million during this period to the US Treasury including helping America secure its borders.

LAS VEGAS, July 26 (Reuters) - Facebook Inc will provide initial funding of $500,000 for a nonprofit organization that aims to help protect political parties, voting systems and information providers from hackers and propaganda attacks, the world's largest social network said on Wednesday.

The initiative, dubbed Defending Digital Democracy, is led by the former campaign chairs for Democrat Hillary Clinton and Republican Mitt Romney, and will initially be based at Harvard University's Kennedy School of Government, which announced the project last week.

Facebook said it hoped additional participants would turn it into a freestanding information-sharing center controlled by its members. Facebook, with two billion monthly users, bills itself as a vehicle for political debate and education, but was also used as a major platform to spread fake news and propaganda during the U.S. election campaign in 2016.

Facebook Chief Security Officer Alex Stamos announced the company's backing at the opening of the Black Hat information security conference in Las Vegas on Wednesday. The event, named after the term for malicious hackers, is aimed mainly at corporate and government security professionals.

Stamos declined to say how much money the Facebook would spend.

""Right now we are the founding sponsor, but we are in discussions with other tech organizations,"" Stamos said in an interview before the speech. ""The goal for our money specifically is to help build a standalone ISAO (Information Sharing and Analysis Organization) that pulls in all the different groups that have some kind of vulnerability.""

The project will be managed by Eric Rosenbach, a former U.S. Assistant Secretary of Defense who is co-director of the Kennedy School's Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs.

""Most campaigns don't have the tools right now to defend themselves from cyber attacks,"" Clinton campaign chair Robby Mook said in an email. ""Our initiative aims to fill that void and to help both Democratic and Republican campaigns defend themselves with greater information-sharing and security tools.""

""This is a forward-looking and bipartisan effort to tackle a real problem,"" said 2012 Romney campaign manager Matt Rhoades in an email.

Stamos also urged Black Hat attendees, many of whom are leery of government intrusion, to be more open-minded about helping law enforcement track criminals and terrorists.

Unthinking rejection of official requests could lead to legislation forcing companies to break their own encryption, Stamos warned.

Stamos said he would continue to argue against such steps.

""We're not going to be effective unless we demonstrate that we have the same goals,"" he said. ""I want to present our position that strong cryptography is a critical part of building a safe, trustworthy future."" (Reporting by Joseph Menn; Editing by Jonathan Weber)

In November 2016, Sullivan pleaded guilty to one count of conspiring with inmates to distribute Suboxone, a drug used to treat opioid addiction, between October and December 2015.

In January 2017, U.S. District Court Judge Richard G. Stearns sentenced John S. Weir, 34, of Danvers, Mass., to the same sentence after Weir pleaded guilty to conspiring with inmates to distribute Suboxone between September and November 2014. Both Sullivan and Weir have resigned from their positions as corrections officers.

The investigations revealed that Weir and Sullivan obtained Suboxone strips from sources outside the jail and smuggled the contraband into the facility when reporting for their shifts. Inmates receiving the Suboxone from Weir and Sullivan then sold the drug to other prisoners inside the correctional facility.

Essex County Sheriff Kevin F. Coppinger said, ""We have a zero tolerance policy for this type of behavior and we will take swift and decisive action in all cases.""

Acting United States Attorney William D. Weinreb; Harold H. Shaw, Special Agent in Charge of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Boston Division; and Essex County Sheriff Coppinger, made the announcement. Assistant U.S. Attorney William F.

Suddenly, a car driving at high speed in the opposite lane, started coming head on in the convoy's direction.

Kosolapov reacted instantaneously and shielded the children's buses with his own car, a decision that may well have saved hundreds of young lives.

""As a result of the massive collision the patrol car was literally turned into a pile of metal. According to the experts, it's a miracle the police officer is still alive,"" Khakassian police said in a statement.

Kosolapov is now conscious and in a stable condition, spokesman for the region's police, Sergey Kuznetsov, reports, adding the officer has already spoken to his colleagues.

259341,False,1024,"I've always had a soft spot for Heimerdinger. He was the second champion I played (behind a very confusing game as Twitch), and the first champion I considered my ""main"". Call it a soft-spot for small, intelligent characters, but something about the little afro-headed genius clicked. Turrets that farmed for me? Instantly-hitting rockets? You had me at substandard intelligence!

Of course, as I continued my time in the League of Legends, the general stigma that followed my Heimerdinger obsession was made readily apparent; people, to this day, hate having the smartest Yordle ever on their team. His pick-rate is the fourth worst currently, and his win-rate fluctuates from average to 'meh'. Anyone playing him is instantly a ""troll"" or a ""noob"", and after a couple months of playing him, I was forced into different roles and champions.

But why is Heimerdinger so despised, left amongst the Lost Legends never to be seen again? He's had a rough balance history, and hasn't been touched recently, but does that mean he's as bad as his reputation? And with the sweeping changes of the ever-approaching Season Three, will he ever be considered pick-worthy?

There is potential in Heimerdinger; I noticed that in Season 2. The one match I had as Heimerdinger had more damage than my other, multiple-game AP mids. His turrets produce some of the most steady AP damage outside of Teemo, and his rockets have 285 base damage at max level. His grenade is potent as well, but landing it is tricky. Overall, the main problem with Heimerdinger is not that his damage is low, but merely inconsistent.

Getting Heimerdinger's abilities to work in your favor is tedious, especially during the laning phase. His turrets generally shoot at anything that seems least threatening, his grenade moves slower than electricity seemingly should, and timing his rockets to hit just before that third minion is able to block them can drive any Summoner to madness. Without any priority to his spell targets beyond distance and luck, Heimerdinger's damage requires a surprising amount of patience and skill for a champion who seems so simple. A lot of this is removed in team fights; as long as their aren't enemy minions/pets to worry about, the damage from his rockets alone is brutal.

Recently, I ran a sample blind-pick game to get some baring on whether the recent changes have made him any more viable. While I haven't had much luck picking him again (people tend to dodge games when they see Heimer), I will explain my thought process and build below.

Role: AP Carry, Mid Lane

Runes:


With my runes, I focus on getting as much penetration as possible, with mana regen and move speed for lane sustain and survival. The penetration Quintessence is optional, as an extra move speed rune in its place is just as helpful.

Masteries:


Fairly standard masteries. Defense or Utility really depends on play style, but I can see both working.

Summoner Spells:

Flash, Ignite, Teleport

Flash is essential, as it provides you with an easy escape (which Heimer is lacking). Secondary choice is more personal. Ignite is always nice, but Heimerdinger is usually not putting himself in range to use it. Teleport is the best alternative, but any can be used to match your play style.

Build Order:

Dorans Ring -> Haunting Guise -> Sorcerer's Shoes -> Void Staff -> Rabadon's Deathcap

Options:

Liandry's Torment, Rylai's Crystal Scepter, Athene's Unholy Grail, Zhonya's Hourglass

With my items, I focus on getting as much magic penetration as possible, as quickly as possible. Heimerdinger's spells have high base damage with average ratios. I don't recommend instantly upgrading Haunting Guise, as it has the same penetration as Liandry's and the money is best spent elsewhere. After Void Staff, you've hit max penetration, and can start building damage. Rabadon's is essential, but after that the choice is more based on how team fights are going. Rylai's gets fully proc'd with each rocket, Zhonya's is great if you keep getting focused down in fights, and Athene's is a good solution for any mana problems.

Laning:

Heimerdinger is a defensive laner, and relies mostly on the poke from his rockets to keep his lane opponent at bay. Leveling skills generally goes in this order:

Rockets, Turrets, Grenade.

Rockets offer the best controllable damage, so I tend to level them first.

The 84-year-old Arlington Memorial Bridge is reaching the end of its design life. As the bridge crumbles and deteriorates at an accelerated pace, it could potentially close by 2021, according to Jenny Anzelmo-Sarles of the National Park Service.

The bridge, which spans 2,100 feet, has a $250 million price tag to stay open in the long term. The NPS has been trying to raise this funding for the past four years. But the agency's annual budget is $3 billion, and only $268 million is currently going toward transportation infrastructure.

""The National Park Service will need the support of partnerships with other federal, state, and local entities, to compete successfully for funds available from the Department of Transportation,"" park service director Jonathan Jarvis said in a release. ""We are pursuing every funding possibility to find a path forward to repair Memorial Bridge.""

Inspection shows accelerated deterioration, indicates Memorial Bridge may close in 2021 w/o $250 million overhaul. pic.twitter.com/UNjuOTJJn5 — Jenny A-S NPS (@JennyASNPS) March 3, 2016

Last spring, the NPS had to close parts of the bridge to complete emergency repairs. Vehicles driving on the open parts of the crossing were restricted to a 10-ton load limit, eliminating most buses from traveling across the span. That limit still stands today.

The agency also moved up temporary repairs, which were supposed to start in the fall. At the time, the bridge topped the American Road & Transportation Builders Association's list of the most-traveled structurally deficient bridges in D.C. The unfortunate distinction is mostly due to the corrosion of the steel in the drawbridge portion, plus some supportive materials are missing altogether, according to the NPS.

The bridge is crossed more than 68,000 times a day. And if the drawbridge fails, there could be a six-to-eight inch drop in the roadway.

The crossing connects the Lincoln Memorial with Arlington National Cemetery and the Robert E. Lee Memorial. It was built to commemorate the reunification of the United States after the Civil War and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

A temporary fix is scheduled to begin next year at a cost of $5 million.",0.33886135367358394,0.738861353673584,-0.4,0.0

Islands have been coveted as strategic shipping stopover and potential wellspring of resources

Argentina and Britain fought over the islands in 1982

More recently, the Argentinians have accused the British of blatant colonialism

Argentinian President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner has again opened the dispute over sovereignty of the Falkland Islands in the South Atlantic, accusing the British government of blatant colonialism.

Known to the Argentinians as Las Malvinas, the two countries went to war over the territory in 1982 after the then military government in Argentina landed troops on the islands.

In an open letter to British Prime Minister David Cameron and published in British newspapers Thursday, the Argentinian leader said ""Britain, the colonial power, has refused to return the territories to the Argentine Republic, thus preventing it from restoring its territorial integrity.""

The British government was swift to respond, insisting that there would be no discussions over sovereignty ""unless and until such as the time as the islanders so wish.""

It is the latest in a recent series of incidents that has raised tensions between the two countries.

What led to the latest dispute?

259073,True,615,"While debate rages on over the effects of wireless technology on human health, those who claim a hypersensitivity to electromagnetism have called on B.C. Ferries to provide options to limit their exposure.

Louise Campbell of Nanoose Bay says her sensitivity to wireless devices can make a ferry ride to the Mainland a nightmare.

article continues below

""For me, my day is thinking about how long I can spend in the mall, because there's Wi-Fi in the mall. If I'm going to a friend's house, I have to ask them to turn the Wi-Fi off,"" she said.

Campbell claims her condition causes her to become lightheaded when exposed to wireless devices.

A two-hour trip into the city can leave her fatigued for the rest of the day. Campbell avoids restaurants, coffee shops, movie theatres and anywhere she expects exposure.

The situation impelled Campbell to call on B.C. Ferries to provide a way to limit exposure to the ship's wireless technology while on voyages to the Mainland.

She is not the first to make the request, said B.C. Ferries spokeswoman Deborah Marshall. Marshall advised people like Campbell to reach out to the customer care department.

""There are some areas on the ship that the signals are quite weak . . . for example, the car decks,"" she said.

The effect of wireless technologies, like Wi-Fi routers and cellphones, on human health has become a contentious topic in recent years. Many in the scientific and medical communities have countered the assault on wireless with stiff resistance. Those who say they suffer call it a disability.

Christel Martin, the Nanaimo representative for Citizens for Safe Technology, said more support is needed for people with the disability.

""There has to be a Wi-Fi-free zone,"" she said. ""We're asking for equal rights, like any disabled person.""

Health Canada maintains that ""there is no convincing scientific evidence that exposure to low-level radiofrequency energy from Wi-Fi causes adverse health effects in humans.""

Nevertheless, the debate will continue in the coming years as public Wi-Fi becomes more common and the world around us grows increasingly wireless.

The B.C. Centre for Disease Control capped off a two-year project in March with the release of its ""radiofrequency toolkit"" for environmental health practitioners.

The 371-page report broke down the myriad types of wireless frequencies used in Canada, the research on their effects and methods to avoid exposure.

""We realize that there will continue to be divergent views on the effects of RF. And we hope that scientists from across Canada can join us in contributing their knowledge and understanding to future integrative work in this enormous field,"" wrote Dr. Tom Kosatsky, the BCCDC's director of environmental health services.

259091,False,1024,"To the eternal gratitude of pure football fans, Next Gen Stats lack the capability to provide hot takes on the Week 15 antics that led to Odell Beckham's one-game suspension.

What Next Gen Stats can tell us, though, is that the notion of Josh Norman shutting the Giants' No. 1 receiver down is pure hogwash.

There was no clear victor in this over-hyped matchup.

Beckham caught four of six passes for 30 yards and the game-tying touchdown with Norman in coverage on 22 of Eli Manning's 47 pass plays, per Next Gen Stats.

Those numbers don't begin to tell the full story.

While Norman's superior physicality neutralized Beckham near the line of scrimmage, downfield routes were a different story.

Just over a minute into the game, Beckham beat Norman off the line and broke inside, gaining open space only to drop a potential 52-yard touchdown. Beckham had 2.5 yards of separation on Norman when the perfectly placed ball struck his hands.

A similar scenario played out early in the third quarter when Manning targeted Beckham on a 40-yard throw. Beckham gained 2.08 yards of separation by the time the ball left Manning's hand and a gaping 4.25 yards when the ball hit the ground on a misfire caused by Panthers defensive end Charles Johnson.

Beckham also beat Norman on a 10-yard sideline pass, only to drop a low pass from Manning.

In total, Beckham won enough routes versus Norman to leave roughly 100 yards and a touchdown on the field.

NFL Films senior producer Greg Cosell put it in even starker terms after meticulously reviewing the all-22 film.

""Norman did match up to Beckham, but they didn't play man coverage very often. And in fact, Beckham killed him,"" Cosell said this week on the Fantasy Guru Matchup Podcast. ""I watched every play and I studied it hard because I knew it would be a topic of conversation. Beckham was beaten mentally. ... But physically, it's not even close. Norman can't cover Beckham.""

Norman is a worthy Defensive Player of the Year candidate and should join Patrick Peterson as the first-team All-Pro cornerbacks this season. But he certainly didn't ""shut down"" Odell Beckham in the Panthers' shootout victory.

If anything, Beckham shut himself down for 57 minutes.

Here's what else we learned from Next Gen Stats in Week 15:

1. While that receiver-cornerback clash failed to produce a clear victor, the same cannot be said for the showdown between Steelers wideout Antonio Brown and Broncos corner Chris Harris in their own shootout at Heinz Field. Entering the game, Harris hadn't surrendered a touchdown since Week 12 of the 2013 season. It was realistic for the Broncos to believe the ultra-stingy Harris could hold his own versus Brown, while Aqib Talib concentrated on Martavis Bryant and Courtney Roby trailed Markus Wheaton. That wasn't the case. Harris battled, but Brown still burned him for 147 yards and a pair of touchdowns on 13 receptions and 15 targets in Harris' coverage.

Harris just earned his second straight Pro Bowl nod. He's one of the best in the business. Brown is on another level.

2. Sammy Watkins isn't quite at Brown's level, but he's trending in that direction. Watkins is fourth in receiving yards and third in receiving touchdowns over the past five weeks. Emerging as one of the NFL's most dangerous deep threats, Watkins reached 22.13 mph on his 48-yard bomb -- the second-fastest speed on a touchdown catch this season. The previous week against Philadelphia, Watkins had the fourth-highest speed (21.15 mph) on his first-quarter touchdown. As well as he's playing, it's understandable that he would be calling out underperforming teammates for not putting forth the same effort level.

3. The rebirth of Darren McFadden -- written off as washed-up prior to his age-28 season -- has been a bright spot in an otherwise dark Cowboys season. McFadden covered an efficient 3.27 yards per rushing yard gained versus the Jets, reaching a max speed of 21.27 mph on a 33-yard run. He now owns two of the five highest speeds at the position over the past two weeks. Even though McFadden didn't join the starting lineup until Halloween, Adrian Peterson is the only player in the league with more 100-yard rushing performances this season.

4. Cardinals rookie David Johnson was even more efficient in covering just 2.93 yards per scrimmage yard gained versus the Eagles. Johnson's total distance traveled of 671 yards was the most of any Week 15 running back, resulting in 229 yards from scrimmage. The tackle-breaking 47-yard touchdown run that channeled Marshawn Lynch's ""Beast Mode"" covered more distance (69.48 yards) and reached a higher speed",0.5912570275972514,0.6912570275972514,-0.1,0.0

Kill Switch is directed by first-time filmmaker Tim Smit and, honestly, the trailer doesn't look half bad. You don't really get a sense of the story in it, but the visuals certainly make us think this might be a film worth checking out later this summer. Stress the ""might be.""

257147,False,1024,"In January, Minnesota's top agriculture and environmental leaders gathered at a triumphant news conference to announce a $9 million federal grant for a novel project to help farmers protect streams and rivers from the chemicals that come off their land.

A one-year trial had been a resounding success, Agriculture Commissioner Dave Frederickson announced. The federal money, combined with another $11 million from the state, would finance a full-scale launch. It would make Minnesota a national leader in showing how farmers will step up to solve one of the country's most grievous environmental problems — agricultural water pollution.

But a growing chorus of critics is saying not so fast. Some say the project won't do enough to protect the water and that its effectiveness can't be measured. Others say it's not ready for prime time because its success with farmers so far has been spotty.

The surprisingly sharp discord that has erupted around the Water Quality Certification Program reflects a growing urgency about the best way to use $110 million a year in Legacy funding devoted to clean water. Even though the Legacy Amendment has 20 years of life left, many fear that Minnesota is running out of time to reverse a landscape-sized problem that was decades in the making.

And this particular investment ""falls short of its promotion,"" said Steve Morse, executive director of the Minnesota Environmental Partnership, which lobbies on behalf of environmental groups. In a state where chemically intensive agriculture occupies about half the land, the effort is a waste of money because it can never achieve ""the scale needed to correct the problem,"" he said.

Officials from the Minnesota Department of Agriculture say the program is a major step in on-farm conservation and water protection. It is unique because it uses a simple score to grade each farm as whole, and provides expert technical advice to help farmers design water-protection plans specific to each field.

Widespread resistance

Nothing will ever eliminate all agricultural water pollution, said assistant Agriculture Commissioner Matt Wohlman, ""but I think we will see measurable results here in Minnesota.""

But resistance to the effort is broad. In December, the state's Clean Water Council, which oversees Legacy money for clean water, refused to recommend the proposed increase in funding. Environmental groups are rallying against more taxpayer investment in a project without proven results. Now some key Republican legislators may put the brakes on.

""I don't think we are ready to go statewide,"" said Rep. Paul Torkelson, R-Hanska, a farmer who sits on the House environment committee and the Legacy Finance Committee.

The certification program was initiated with great fanfare nearly three years ago. Gov Mark Dayton stood with the head of the Environmental Protection Agency, the U.S. Secretary of Agriculture and other top officials to announce the first federal-state partnership in farm conservation. The ambitious strategy would give farmers a green seal of approval if they acted voluntarily to protect the water from fertilizer, soil erosion and other contamination. In return, they would be exempt from any new water-quality regulations — a ""certainty"" designed to woo farmers into signing up.

The idea was driven by a combination of political and fiscal realities that still stand. Farms are not covered by the federal Clean Water Act, the nation's main water pollution law, and regulating farmers faces political hurdles. At the same time, funding for long-standing farm conservation programs has been severely cut, and their financial incentives cannot compete with high commodity prices or federal subsidies that spur farmers to increase production.

Last year, with $3 million in Legacy funds and $3 million from the USDA, the state Agriculture Department started recruiting farmers in four watersheds. So far, just 30 farmers have succeeded in winning the green certification sign that they can post on their driveways, but some 260 more are in the process, officials say.

""It's somewhat difficult to attain,"" said Ken Schefers, a farmer near Paynesville who served on the program's advisory board, and was one of the first to sign up. He and his family raise a variety of crops and livestock, and he was already pretty water-conscious, he said. Even so, he had to conduct more soil tests and track his manure applications. He also added more grass buffers around his ditches and fields.

Mark Lefebvre, a specialist with the Stearns County Soil and Water Conservation District who works full-time for the certification program, said the scoring system, which rates farms from 1 to 10, is the best educational tool he's ever used in working with farmers.

""They can see their score on paper in black and white,"" he said.

Others say the scoring system, in practice, does little to protect the water. Kris Sigford, a water quality specialist with the Minnesota Center for Environmental Advocacy, said it does a poor job of accounting for the pesticides and nitrogen fertilizer lost through drainage systems that lie beneath a huge portion of the state's fields. That source alone makes up more than a third",0.4943040039411155,0.7943040039411156,-0.30000000000000004,0.0
258716,False,1024,"Dialysis High Costs and Hidden Perils of a Treatment Guaranteed to All

Dec. 10: This post has been updated twice.


Patients treated at dialysis clinics run by the largest U.S. for-profit chains have a higher risk of death than patients treated by the biggest nonprofit chain, a study released today in the journal Health Services Research concludes.

The outcome gaps are substantial: Patients at the largest for-profit chain were found to have a 19 percent higher risk of death than patients receiving care at the nonprofit; at the second-largest chain, the risk was 24 percent higher.

""The difference is very significant,"" said Yi Zhang, who led the study conducted by the Medical Technology & Practice Patterns Institute, a Bethesda nonprofit. ""It's not five or seven percent. It's pretty dramatic.""

The study also found that patients had a 13 percent lower mortality risk if they were treated at nonprofit clinics, regardless of chain ownership, than if they received care at for-profit clinics.

The study's findings are likely to stir debate because U.S. mortality rates for dialysis remain among the highest in the industrialized world -- one in five patients dies each year -- and because more patients than ever are getting their care from for-profit chains.

More than 80 percent of American dialysis clinics are run for profit. Chain ownership has increased more than 11-fold since the early 1990s. Two for-profit companies -- Fresenius Medical Care North America and DaVita Inc. -- now control about two-thirds of the market for dialysis care.

In a recent ProPublica investigation, some doctors, patients and advocates voiced concern that industry consolidation has winnowed down care options, thus reducing competition, and questioned whether providers' efforts to make money had affected quality.

Today's study does not identify chains by name, but Fresenius and DaVita ranked first and second in number of clinics in 2004, the start of the study period. Since then, they have acquired the two chains that were next in size. The largest nonprofit chain is Nashville-based Dialysis Clinic Inc.

A Fresenius spokeswoman said the company would not comment on the study's findings until it had a chance to examine them fully. DaVita officials said the study reflected an outdated version of reality.

""This study examines seven-year-old data, and significant changes in the way dialysis care is delivered have been made in the more than half a decade since, with continued overall improvement in patient outcomes,"" the company said in a written statement.

More recent information from the federally funded U.S. Renal Data System (USDRS) shows that large dialysis providers achieve better mortality outcomes than nonchain or hospital-based facilities, the DaVita statement added.

The MTPPI study excluded patients treated in hospital centers -- a key difference with some previous studies -- because they tend to treat patients with more complicating conditions, government data show.

In comparing chains to each other, however, the study's results largely mirror those in reports by the USRDS showing that Dialysis Clinic Inc. has lower mortality and hospitalization rates than other large dialysis providers.

The study tracked about 34,900 Medicare patients who started dialysis in 2004 at 3,601 free-standing clinics, following them for two years. Medicare pays for most dialysis under an entitlement created in 1972.

Researchers compared outcomes at the five largest dialysis chains -- four for-profits and one nonprofit -- and at nonchain clinics. They adjusted data for differences in patient mix, as well as for facility size, staffing, geographic disparities and income inequality.

In addition to lower mortality risk, the study found that patients at the nonprofit chain had the shortest hospital stays and were most likely to be in the recommended range for anemia, despite being given the lowest doses of anemia-treatment drugs. Its clinics also were staffed differently, with more nurses relative to patient-care technicians, who are unlicensed and, typically, lower paid.

Update (12/9): DCI did not comment on specific findings but released a statement from founder and board Chairman Dr. H. Keith Johnson saying the chain's ""non-profit status allows us to devote a larger proportion of our resources to improving the care we offer to our patients.""

Update (12/10): Fresenius spokeswoman Jane A. Kramer today issued the following statement:

""From the study's title, the methods-- all the way to the concluding statements, the authors loosely used the terms chain-affiliation, profit status, and chain size, three separate dimensions, and disingenuously intermingled them to reveal a strong pre-analytic bias. The authors themselves state that selection bias is 'likely to exist.' These data are over 5-7 years old – the environment has changed, with new scientific discoveries and clinical practice changes in place.

Instructions

Step 1 – The Relay

Relays are switching circuits that can close and break circuits mechanically. That means it can control an electrical circuit by closing and breaking connections in that circuit.

As you can see, there are mainly 5 terminals in a relay. Two for energizing the coil, one Common terminal, a Normally Closed terminal which will be connected to the Common terminal when the coil is not energized and a Normally Open terminal which will be in contact with the Common terminal when the coil is energized.

This is how the relay works. In our case, we will be connecting

GPIO pins to One End of Coil

Ground to other End of Coil

Phase of Main Power Supply to The Common terminal or Pole

One Terminal of bulb (Or other electrical Appliance) to Normally Open Terminal

And the Other Terminal of Bulb to Neutral Point of Main Power Supply

Since the Output of Raspberry Pi GPIO pins are 3.3V, you will have to buy a 3.3V Relay. You can purchase the relay board of 4 relays that is compatible with Raspberry Pi from here or click on the image.

Step 2 – The Raspberry Pi

256444,False,1024,"Justin Meram chuckled for a moment earlier this week, acknowledging how crazy all of this is.

The 28-year-old midfielder is a little more than two months removed from signing a contract extension with Crew SC. With four goals and four assists through 11 games, Meram is a Best XI contender. He also is a focal point of a Crew team looking to re-establish its credibility after a disastrous 2016 season. For all of his recent successes, Meram has been noticeably more critical of himself, a product, he said, of not being satisfied.

""I've been here for seven years, but there's no more of this 'hug it out' and 'you're young and growing,' "" Meram said. ""I'm not stopping, and if I stop, I'm shortchanging myself and this club.""

Meram isn't about to stop, especially given where he has come from. The Justin Meram of 10 years ago had virtually no prospects in soccer. Today's Justin Meram is still a bit bewildered by the path he took to professional soccer.

""I had an interesting, tough, weird journey to get to where I'm at,"" he said.

In summer 2007, Meram was more or less done playing soccer. He graduated from Eisenhower High School in Shelby Township, Michigan, without soccer scholarship offers, and moved with his family to Arizona.

""The local schools in Michigan, the club coaches, the local teams, the (professional development) teams, nobody wanted me,"" Meram said. ""No one thought I had talent.""

But he missed soccer, and that was enough for him to join his brothers for a men's league game at a park in Scottsdale, just hours after arriving in Phoenix. Wearing basketball shorts and Kelme turf shoes, he played well enough to catch the eye of Maurice Hughes.

Hughes, it turns out, was a Phoenix native who was home after a stint with the minor-league Atlanta Silverbacks. He also was a two-time national champion at Yavapai College, a community college in Prescott, Arizona.

Hughes was shocked to learn that Meram didn't have a place to play, and he offered to put Meram in touch with Yavapai coach Mike Pantalione.

Meram said his backup plan at the time was to enroll at Arizona State, where he had been in touch with the football team's special-teams coach and planned to walk on as a kicker. The sequence of events — how things fell into place to continue his soccer career — still gives Meram chills.

""What would I be doing with my life if Maurice Hughes wasn't watching a friend, or if my brother (Jason) didn't take Maurice Hughes' number down?"" Meram said. ""He told me about a school called Yavapai. What is Yavapai?""

Hughes said he hadn't spoken to Pantalione in a few years when he phoned the longtime coach on a Sunday afternoon.

""I just told him, 'Hey, this is really random, and I know you probably already have your roster for next year, but I have this kid that I just encountered,'"" Hughes recalled.

Pantalione bought Hughes' endorsement. He bought Meram's ability from the team's first training session of the 2007 season, in which he put his team through six-a-side drills to get everyone a few touches on the ball.

""I remember it vividly. A number of players scored one or two goals in the two-hour session, and Justin had about a dozen,"" Pantalione said.

Yavapai went 50-2 during the 2007 and '08 seasons, winning two national titles. Meram set the school record with 132 points and sits No. 2 on the career goals list with 51. Meram primarily played forward, but every so often — Pantalione estimates about 20 percent of the time — he moved Meram out to the left wing to open things up inside the box.

""I was saying it in a joking fashion, but I said, 'Hey, when you're a pro someday, that's where you're going to play, so get out there,'"" Pantalione said. ""He would kind of just shake his head and eventually wander out there.""

Today, Pantalione laughs when he watches left wing Justin Meram play for Crew SC because he knows which moves are coming. He made clear that Meram's success — just like that of Yavapai alumni Alan Gordon (Colorado Rapids) and Roger Espinoza (Sporting Kansas City) — was the player's creation.

""All we did was open the door for him, and he took full advantage,"" Pantalione said.

As Meram put it: ""From no scholarships to too many.""

259052,False,1024,"One year from now, the 2012 Olympic Games will begin in London, where all eyes will be on the incomparable Usain Bolt -- the Jamaican sprinter who is more than living up to his name.

Since 2008, Bolt has taken a jackhammer to the 100-meter world record, lopping off a whopping .14 seconds. That might not sound like a huge chunk of time until you consider it's twice as much as any other sprinter has shaved off the world record since the advent of electronic scoring.

Logically, one would think that Bolt did so by moving his legs faster than anyone else. Only he didn't.

Speed, as it turns out, may be completely misunderstood.

When Bolt established the current 100-meter world record in the 2009 world championships, running it in 9.58 seconds, he did so by moving his legs at virtually the same pace as his competitors. In fact, if you or I were to compete against Bolt, our legs would turn over at essentially the same rate as his.

This is a theory put forth by academics and track coaches alike who contend that running fast has more to do with the force one applies to the ground than how quickly one can move one's legs.

More than a decade ago, Peter Weyand, a science professor at Southern Methodist University, conducted a study on speed. Comparing athletes to non-athletes, Weyand clocked both test groups as they ran at their top speed. What he found shocked him.

""The amount of time to pick up a leg and put it down is very similar,"" he says. ""It surprised us when we first figured it out.""

So if leg turnover is the same, how does one person run faster than another?

Weyand discovered that speed is dependent upon two variables: The force with which one presses against the ground and how long one applies that force.

Think of the legs as springs. The more force they can push against the ground, the further they can propel the body forward, thus maximizing the output of each individual step. In a full sprint, the average person applies about 500 to 600 pounds of force. An Olympic sprinter can apply more than 1,000 pounds.

But force isn't the only factor. How quickly that force is applied factors in as well.

For this, think of bouncing a beach ball versus a super ball. The beach ball is soft and mushy and when bounced on the ground sits for a while before slowly rebounding back into the air. Conversely, a super ball is hard and stiff and when bounced rebounds almost instantaneously -- and at a much faster speed than the beach ball.

The average person's foot is on the ground for about .12 seconds, while an Olympic sprinter's foot is on the ground for just .08 seconds -- a 33-percent difference.

""The amount of time [one's legs are] in the air is .12, regardless if you're fast or slow,"" Weyand explains. ""An elite sprinter gets the aerial time they need with less time on the ground to generate that lift -- or to get back up in the air -- because they can hit harder.""

So what makes Bolt faster than even the elite sprinters? And can he run the 100 meters even faster than 9.58 seconds?

Bolt's superiority is often explained by his unique combination of height, strength and acceleration.

At 6-foot-5, Bolt is two inches taller than fellow Jamaican Asafa Powell (pictured together below) and has six inches on American Tyson Gay -- two of his closest challengers. While it takes most elite sprinters 44 strides to complete 100 meters, Bolt does it in 41.

""Would you rather take 44 steps to your car or 41?"" asks Dan Pfaff, who coached Canada's Donovan Bailey to the 100-meter gold during the Atlanta Games in 1996.

Pfaff, now working in London to help boost Great Britain's track-and-field hopes for 2012, says Bolt's height gives him a distinct leverage advantage.

""If you're digging a hole in the ground, you have to get a longer lever to pry [out a rock],"" he explains. ""If you can control those levers and make them work efficiently, it's a huge advantage.""

It's Bolt's ability to control the levers that is so unusual for a sprinter his height.

While taller sprinters may be able to reach a higher top-end speed, getting up to that speed isn't as easy. This can be explained physiologically -- smaller people can exert more force in relation to how much they weigh -- but Weyand prefers a more simple visual to show this to be true.

""You can easily imagine a 4-foot-10 gymnast doing a triple back flip, but imagine Shaquille O'Neal or Yao Ming doing it,"" he",0.05376371934038138,0.7537637193403814,-0.7000000000000001,0.0
255248,True,493,"Fitness fanatics should reach for the mustard and NOT spinach if they want to look like Popeye


Fitness fanatics looking to build muscle should consider reaching for the mustard, a study has found.


The steroid homobrassinolide, found in the mustard plant, increases muscle mass, the size of muscle fibres and appetite, research suggests.


In addition, the effect when tested on rats was similar to anabolic steroids, which promote the growth of muscle and which are used illegally by athletes to improve performance.


Spinach is out, and mustard is in as one way to build your muscle strength, according to a new study


A team of scientists exposed rat muscle cells to different amounts of homobrassinolide and measured protein synthesis – the process in which cells build proteins – in cell culture. The result was increased production – vital for building muscles – and decreased breakdown of protein in the cells.

Researcher Dr Slavo Komarnytsky, at North Carolina State University, said: 'We hope that one day brassinosteroids may provide an effective, natural, and safe alternative for age and disease-associated muscle loss, or be used to improve endurance and physical performance.'

'Because some plants we eat contain these compounds, like mustards, in the future we may be able to breed or engineer these plants for higher brassinosteroid content, thus producing functional foods that can treat or prevent diseases and increase physical performance.'

Old school: Cartoon character Popeye missed a trick on not including mustard in his strength-diet

Dr Gerald Weissmann, editor of the FASEB Journal, in which the study was published, added: ' The temptation is to see this discovery as another quick fix to help you go from fat to fit, and to a very small degree, this may be true.

'This study identifies an important drug target for a wide range of conditions that cause muscle wasting.'


During the research healthy rats then received an oral dose of homobrassinolide daily for 24 days and changes in body weight, food consumption and body consumption were measured.


Rats receiving the steroid gained more weight and slightly increased their food intake.


Body composition was measured and showed increased lean body mass in the animals treated.

""Republicans need to be clear,"" he wrote in his January 20 commentary. ""Marijuana use doesn't lead to anything helpful or productive. The president won't say so, but Republican leaders should.""


Not if they're shopping for votes. Recently released statewide polls indicate that marijuana law reform remains a winning issue among voters – and not just voters in stereotypically 'blue' states. Here's a look at various red states that are rapidly turning ""green.""


Arizona


Arizona remains the only state in America where first-time marijuana possession offenses are classified as felonies, punishable by up to two years in prison. And while a majority of state lawmakers remain unwilling to embrace marijuana law reform (the state has the sixteenth highest per capita rate of pot possession arrests in the nation), their constituents are more than ready to do so. Fifty-six percent of Arizonans support legalizing pot for adults, according to polling data released in May. (A separate Public Policy Poll from last January reported even higher support, finding that 59 percent of Grand Canyon State voters would vote 'yes' on an initiative to regulate the weed like alcohol.) At least one state Representative is listening. Democrat lawmaker Ruben Gallego is backing legislation this session to legalize the production and retail sale of the plant. The measure faces an uphill battle. In 2012, Republican Gov. Jan Brewer filed a lawsuit to try and halt the implementation of the state's 2010 voter-approved medical marijuana law. (A federal court ultimately rejected Brewer's request.)


Georgia


Nearly 33,000 Georgians were arrested in 2010 for possessing marijuana – a figure that was the sixth highest in the nation. But according to a just-published statewide Public Policy Poll, a majority of Peach State voters would prefer to see that total be reduced to zero. According to the January PPP poll, 54 percent of Georgians support ""changing state law to regulate and tax marijuana similarly to alcohol."" Fifty-seven percent of those Georgians surveyed support making cannabis legal for medical purposes. And 62 percent of voters support amending state law to make possession offenses a civil violation punishable by a fine up to $100, but without jail time. (Under present law, the possession of any amount of cannabis is classified as a criminal misdemeanor, punishable by up to one year in jail and a $1,000 fine.) Following the poll's release, some state lawmakers have expressed interest in forming a study committee to explore various options to allow for the herb's medical use, including allowing for the options of high CBD, low THC strains of the plant.


Indiana


Fifty-two percent of Hoosiers believe that cannabis ""should be regulated like alcohol,"" according to statewide polling data released in December by Ball State University. A slightly greater percentage of Indiana voters, 54 percent, support replacing the state's existing criminal penalties for marijuana possession offenses with civil fines. It's understandable why most Hoosiers support such changes in law. In Indiana, first-time pot possession is classified as a criminal misdemeanor punishable by up to one-year in jail and a $5,000 fine. In 2010, the FBI reported that police made nearly 13,000 arrests for minor marijuana possession violations. Democrat-sponsored legislation to decriminalize the possession of up to two ounces of pot by is presently pending before Senate lawmakers. However, Republican Gov. Mike Pence has spoken out against reforming the state's cannabis penalties, calling the plant a ""gateway drug.""


Louisiana


Few southern states treat pot offenses more harshly than does Louisiana. But while state lawmakers may publically back strict penalties for weed, their constituents do not. Fifty-three percent of voters believe that cannabis ought to be legalized, taxed, and regulated, according to Public Policy Polling data released last fall. Fifty-six percent of voters support decriminalizing the plant and 65 percent support legalizing its medical use. Nonetheless, last year, Senate lawmakers defeated legislation that sought to amend the penalties for repeat marijuana possession offenders. (Under present law, second-time marijuana offenders face up to five years imprisonment and a $2,000 fine. Subsequent offenders face up to 20 years in prison!) Democrats have reintroduced legislation again this year to address the state's odious pot possession penalties. According to state Department of Corrections officials, 1,372 Louisianians are serving sentences for minor marijuana possession. The average sentence is 8.4 years, with 10 people serving life sentences.


Oklahoma


Oklahoma's marijuana penalties are among the most severe in America. Under state law, first-time marijuana possession offenses are punishable by up to one-year incarceration and subsequent offenses are punishable by up to ten years in prison. Selling marijuana is punishable by up to life in",0.020331224088695588,0.8203312240886956,-0.8,0.0
255724,False,1024,"Preparing for August 21, 2017

On August 21, 2017, there's going to be a total eclipse of the Sun visible on a line across the US. But when exactly will the eclipse occur at a given location? Being able to predict astronomical events has historically been one of the great triumphs of exact science. But in 2017, how well can it actually be done?

The answer, I think, is well enough that even though the edge of totality moves at just over 1000 miles per hour it should be possible to predict when it will arrive at a given location to within perhaps a second. And as a demonstration of this, we've created a website to let anyone enter their geo location (or address) and then immediately compute when the eclipse will reach them—as well as generate many pages of other information.


It's an Old Business

These days it's easy to find out when the next solar eclipse will be; indeed built right into the Wolfram Language there's just a function that tells you (in this form the output is the ""time of greatest eclipse""):

✕ SolarEclipse[]

It's also easy to find out, and plot, where the region of totality will be:

✕ GeoListPlot[SolarEclipse[""TotalPhasePolygon""]]

Or to determine that the whole area of totality will be about 16% of the area of the US:

✕ GeoArea[SolarEclipse[""TotalPhasePolygon""]]/GeoArea[Entity[""Country"", ""UnitedStates""]]

But computing eclipses is not exactly a new business. In fact, the Antikythera device from 2000 years ago even tried to do it—using 37 metal gears to approximate the motion of the Sun and Moon (yes, with the Earth at the center). To me there's something unsettling—and cautionary—about the fact that the Antikythera device stands as such a solitary piece of technology, forgotten but not surpassed for more than 1600 years.

But right there on the bottom of the device there's an arm that moves around, and when it points to an Η or Σ marking, it indicates a possible Sun or Moon eclipse. The way of setting dates on the device is a bit funky (after all, the modern calendar wouldn't be invented for another 1500 years), but if one takes the simulation on the Wolfram Demonstrations Project (which was calibrated back in 2012 when the Demonstration was created), and turns the crank to set the device for August 21, 2017, here's what one gets:

And, yes, all those gears move so as to line the Moon indicator up with the Sun—and to make the arm on the bottom point right at an Η—just as it should for a solar eclipse. It's amazing to see this computation successfully happen on a device designed 2000 years ago.

Of course the results are a lot more accurate today. Though, strangely, despite all the theoretical science that's been done, the way we actually compute the position of the Sun and Moon is conceptually very much like the gears—and effectively epicycles—of the Antikythera device. It's just that now we have the digital equivalent of hundreds of thousands of gears.

Why Do Eclipses Happen?

A total solar eclipse occurs when the Moon gets in front of the Sun from the point of view of a particular location on the Earth. And it so happens that at this point in the Earth's history the Moon can just block the Sun because it has almost exactly the same angular diameter in the sky as the Sun (about 0.5° or 30 arc-minutes).

So when does the Moon get between the Sun and the Earth? Well, basically every time there's a new moon (i.e. once every lunar month). But we know there isn't an eclipse every month. So how come?

✕ Graphics[{Style[Disk[{0, 0}, .3/5], Yellow], Style[Disk[{.8, 0}, .1/5], Gray], Style[Disk[{1, 0}, .15/5], Blue]}]

Well, actually, in the analogous situation of Ganymede and Jupiter, there is an eclipse every time Ganymede goes around Jupiter (which happens to be about once per week). Like the Earth, Jupiter's orbit around the Sun lies in a particular plane (the ""Plane of the Ecliptic""). And it turns out that Ganymede's orbit around Jupiter also lies in essentially the same plane. So every time Ganymede reaches the ""new moon"" position (or, in official astronomy parlance, when it's aligned ""in syzygy""—pronounced sizz-ee-gee), it's in the right place to cast its shadow onto Jupiter, and to eclipse the Sun wherever that shadow",0.12604992822575664,0.7260499282257566,-0.5,-0.1

Because of the digital nature of cyberpunk and our lives today, it's no surprise people are making their own worlds match the fantasy. It could be their home office, gaming room, or even home theater room. All of these rooms lend themselves well to this kind of DIY interior design.

Elements of Cyberpunk Interior Design

The cyberpunk aesthetic can be broken down into three main types: minimalist, chaotic, and retro-futuristic. Before you go saying that there's more types than that, consider that most scenes in any cyberpunk game or movie are, at least, some combination of those. Blending in elements of Asian or even Ancient Egyptian culture is also often seen. You might call it a pan-cultural look as well.

In all three of those types, there are some common elements: electronics, glossy and matte colors with a sparse palette, repetitive geometric patterns, metal, glass, ambient lighting and automation. Lots of ambient lighting and home automation 6 Types of Home Automation You Can Actually Afford 6 Types of Home Automation You Can Actually Afford Are you ready to join the smart home revolution but worried that it's beyond your budget? Smart homes aren't that expensive, and there are plenty of components that the average homeowner can afford. Read More .

These elements seem so common but are used in vastly different ways within the design types. Let's take a look at each type, and a few real world examples in real people's homes.

The Minimalist Cyberpunk Room

Great cinematic and gaming examples of the minimalist design can be found everywhere. Pick a cyberpunk movie, think of where the rich people or villains lived, and that's typically your minimalist cyberpunk room. One example is Flynn's safe room in Tron: Legacy.

Worm Thrall costs one empty black soul gem, and turns the target into a zombie slave. Conjure Black Soul Gem does exactly what it sounds like. Imbue Worm Thrall only works on a Worm Thrall. It upgrades it into a stronger version, at the cost of another empty black soul gem and 100 health. The Tome of Unlife can also be used to combine soul gems to create stronger ones, and to summon an immortal skeleton companion called Creak. Lastly, the Tome makes the player count as a necromancer, making undead and necromancers friednly, and giving a -30 modifier towards the Mage's Guild.

Aglaophotis is a red liquid which is obtained from the refinement of a herb of the same name. It has the ability to dispel demonic forces and grant protection against such forces to those who use the item.

First seen in Silent Hill, it also plays a role in Silent Hill 3. Aglaophotis plays an important role in both games, as its use in the first game heavily affects what ending the player will receive.

Description

A memo in Silent Hill 3 gives a brief description of Aglaophotis.

Aglaophotis Red liquid or crystals resembling blood. According to the Kabbalah, the name is taken from an herb with the power to dispel evil spirits. It is said to grow in Arabian deserts.

It may be vaporized or applied as a poultice to guard against demons. It is powerful, but as it is rare, it is extremely difficult to obtain.

A book in Silent Hill: Play Novel suggests Aglaophotis is also made using White Claudia.[1]

[...........tis] ..de from from the above-mentioned White Claudia,......dr...has.......... u....to perform exor...... It is a viscous liquid, red....color, and is..... adminis..........remedy.....illnesses for which the cause is not kn....

The novelization says it is completely odorless and thinner than blood.

Silent Hill

Dr. Michael Kaufmann, director of Alchemilla Hospital, came into possession of at least two vials of the red liquid. How he obtained them is unknown, though it seems likely from a later conversation with Dahlia Gillespie that Kaufmann was holding onto the substance in the event that Dahlia's plans went in a direction he didn't like.

As Harry Mason explores the town of Silent Hill looking for clues as to the whereabouts of his daughter Cheryl, he comes across Alchemilla Hospital. While searching the hospital, Harry finds a broken bottle of Aglaophotis (then unknown) on the floor in Kaufmann's office. Harry can take the empty plastic bottle from the nearby kitchen and collect a sample and use it to save Cybil Bennett when she is found possessed by a parasite in the merry-go-round at the Lakeside Amusement Park.

Harry can continue investigating Kaufmann's involvement and the Aglaophotis in the Resort Area of Silent Hill. Before reaching the boathouse to meet Cybil, Harry can enter Annie's Bar and save Dr. Kaufmann from an attacking monster. Further investigation of Kaufmann's tracks leads to the discovery of a vial of Aglaophotis hidden in Kaufmann's motorcycle.

If Harry saves Kaufmann, he will appear during Harry's final confrontation with Dahlia in a place known as Nowhere. After Alessa Gillespie is brought to her true form, Kaufmann will appear to intercept Dahlia's plans. He proceeds to shoot Dahlia, then takes the vial of Aglaophotis previously hidden in the motorcycle and hurls it at the combined form of Alessa and Cheryl Mason. The vial breaks and coats the entity in the fluid. Through the Aglaophotis's exorcising power, the ""god"" imbued within Alessa is forced out as the Incubus, a creature created from Dahlia's vision of God.

Silent Hill 3

Heather Mason, the reborn identity of Alessa Gillespie and Cheryl Mason, was given a necklace by her father Harry as a child. Containing a red jewel, it is revealed that the crystal is actually a small capsule of Aglaophotis.

How he procured the sample is unknown. In the Book of Lost Memories, it is stated that ""It would seem that after the first game, Harry once again procured some of the liquid for the sake of his daughter"", which suggests that the sample in the necklace is not what Harry found in Silent Hill.[2]

255206,True,874,"By Robert Mullin

CAISO last week provided an explanation of its decision to increase regulation requirements in response to the growing variability on its system.

The ISO's Department of Market Monitoring last month called attention to the sharp rise in costs from the requirements, prompting the California Energy Commission to ask the ISO to justify the move. (See CAISO Regulation Costs Quadruple as Price, Procurement Jump.)

During a Market Performance and Planning Forum last week, CAISO said it doubled its frequency regulation service requirement from late February to mid-June in response to recurring short-term generation forecasting errors stemming from variable wind and solar resources during late winter and spring.

The forecasting problem is mostly isolated to spring, when high renewable output often coincides with periods of low loads in California. At the same time, weather patterns tend to be more erratic, often making it especially difficult to predict renewable output on a moment-to-moment basis.

Regulation prices more than doubled shortly after the ISO increased its daily regulation procurement from 400 MW or less to as much as 800 MW in late February. Daily payments to regulation service providers surged from $100,000 to more than $400,000, the ISO's Monitor found last month.

The ISO rolled back regulation requirements to previous levels for summer because of more predictable weather patterns.

Further compounding the spring forecasting issue is the increasing adoption of residential rooftop solar, which is subject to the same variability as utility-scale projects. The ISO estimates it has nearly 5,000 MW in rooftop solar in its balancing area, with new installations added daily. Variability in behind-the-meter rooftop output complicates matters by causing loads to skew from forecasts depending on whether the sun is shining.

The problem ""happens more in the off-season — with more of the clouds coming in,"" said Amber Motley, CAISO short-term forecasting manager. ""Timing and forecasting of [generation] ramps are very difficult. Forecasting cloud coverage is difficult.""

Variable wind production can also be a factor, with cold fronts making it difficult to predict the timing of wind ramps and changes in wind direction causing intermittency.

Clyde Loutan, ISO senior advisor for renewable energy integration, said weather changes can occur too quickly to incorporate revised forecasts into the real-time market run. He also pointed out that forecasting errors are not covered under the ISO's real-time contingency dispatch process, which sets aside generation to allow the system to recover from major disturbances.

""So you have to rely on regulation,"" Loutan said.

""Seems like it's more a failure of the forecast,"" said Dan Williams, CAISO markets analyst at Portland General Electric. ""And that should be changed by changing the market rather than rolling it into regulation.""

Loutan countered that he didn't know of any forecaster that could reflect the intermittency in the five-minute market.

""When you think about how these markets were designed, they were really designed for conventional units,"" he said.

Loutan also pointed to a clear financial incentive driving the ISO's increased requirement.

""Back in January we had some pretty bad days when we didn't control the frequency well enough,"" he said. ""For 11 hours, we had a hard time controlling the system. We found out that we were running out of regulation.""

If the condition had persisted longer than 30 consecutive minutes, the ISO would have been subject to as much as $1 million in NERC penalties, he said.

Carolyn Kehrein, principal consultant for the Energy Users Forum, suggested that increased regulation costs should be allocated to intermittent resources if the forecasting problem continued and the ISO didn't develop new tools to deal with it. She said increased costs for intermittency should encourage the ""right kind"" of renewable development, such as geothermal.

Wei Zhou, senior project manager with Southern California Edison, agreed with applying the cost-causation principle to the problem.

""This is something that we're looking at long-term,"" said Loutan, referring to the forecasting issue at large. ""But for now we just wanted to explain why we increased our regulation procurement.""",0.6694101223580932,0.7694101223580931,-0.1,0.0

""They had merely to sit on the edges of Tianfu Square wearing smog masks for police bring them in for interrogation until the early hours of the morning — this is a clear show of how deeply anxious Chengdu authorities are about protests against smog.""

For the last week, inland China has been enveloped in smog. Some cities issued emergency smog warnings; others cancelled outdoor activities at schools. In Chengdu, the capital of Sichuan Province, the government banned gatherings in Tianfu Square (天府广场)— as though they were afraid of something. And just as expected, on the weekend, Chengdu residents came out in numbers on Chunxi road in the central business district and on Tianfu Square. Some sat down quietly wearing pollution masks, others held up banners of protest.

In the frigid winter night of a smog-enclosed 2016, the protest of Chengdu residents was like the flash of a shooting star.

These are the ""smog politics"" of contemporary China. The smog question has almost transformed the landscape of Chinese politics since February 2015, with the broadcast of the documentary ""Under the Dome"" (穹顶之下) by former CCTV journalist Chai Jing (柴静). The government has been busy: Under the aegis of unifying the Jing-Jin-Ji (Beijing, Tianjin, Hebei) conurbation, Beijing has embarked on a project of social engineering aimed at resolving the smog problem: heavily polluting industries in Hebei have been forced to lower output, stop production, or shutter; Beijing has embarked on a program of ""low-end population congestion relief;"" and villages on the outskirts of Beijing are in the midst of converting from coal-based to to natural gas energy for heating. Meanwhile, smog continues to enshroud China now and then, and saturating social media is the discontent of the Chinese middle-class, only interrupted from time to time by a variety of other politically-tinged incidents — the ""poisoned running tracks,"" ""the Lei Yang incident,"" the ""Luo Er fundraising scandal,"" and bullying at the Zhongguancun No. 2 Elementary School.

It is as though a new middle class, as full of uncertainty as it is of energy, is rapidly forming its own class politics in the shroud of China's smog. There is, for instance, the movement to ""make a fortune and get out as soon as possible,"" referring to emigration. There are also large collectives of underground discontent who express themselves on social media. And then there are always the unexpected small-scale protest actions in the streets.

Even as the authorities move to suppress human rights lawyers and emphasize once again political thought work in schools, a politically-awakened middle-class, oriented around the politics of pollution, is forming in a rapidly urbanizing China. With their own series of often indecisive demands and modes of expression, they've begun to displace the rights defense movement that came before, and their numbers are quietly growing.

For instance, on the evening of December 11 in Tianfu Square, the majority of those in the sit-in were local artists and culture workers — they'd either come of their own initiative, or were mobilized by emphatic protest slogans shared on social media in the last few days. The online posts advertising the protest seemed to be inspired by the confluence of art and politics over the last few years: the various artistic creations of Ai Weiwei (艾未未), for instance, or the protest performances of the Song Zhuang art circle (北京宋庄艺术圈子), or the anti-smog demonstrations during the Beijing Marathon. They had merely to sit on the edges of Tianfu Square wearing smog masks for police to bring them in for interrogation until the early hours of the morning — this is a clear show of how deeply anxious Chengdu authorities are about protests against smog. Local social media users on Monday even circulated an official notice that the wearing of masks is prohibited during school assembly, and that air purifiers were not going to be installed. It's as though wearing a face mask is mobilizing for a color revolution.

The deep fearfulness of the regime makes clear the power of middle-class politics ""under the dome"": they need barely to raise a crowd — simply holding a small-scale protest action, even when unlikely to have any real effect, makes the authorities extremely nervous, and they rally the troops like it was the eve of battle. The Pengzhou petrochemical project (彭州石化项目), close to Chengdu and most likely to have a deleterious impact on the environment, probably won't be scrapped because of this.

256050,False,1024,"The Harsh Realities of Recycling in the Rockies

Lifting the lid on waste removal in the Canadian Rocky Mountains.


This article originally ran as ""Out of Sight, Out of Mind"" in the Winter 2014 issue of Highline Magazine.

""What's in the bag?"" I whisper, watching the hairs on my buddy's neck stand on end. My accusatory heckle hisses through the shadowy night in a quiet residential neighbourhood in Jasper. I'm taking out the trash from a post-housewarming soiree. My friend, who didn't see me coming, is disposing of what looks to be his dog's fecal matter.

Meeting someone at the garbage is always a social occasion.

I'm slinking to the bins in the dead of night to dump a salmon carcass. I'm not sure if the remnants should go in compost or garbage, and frankly, I'll use the cloak of darkness to conceal my confusion. As for my buddy, he's just being a responsible dog walker.

Is he going to compost that? I wonder.

After seeing the unsorted mess that several inconsiderate ""recyclers"" have left in the cardboard, compost and garbage disposal containers lately, I have become wary of midnight dumpers. Over the last few weeks, with barely-repressed rage, I have discovered that, when it comes to properly sorting their refuse, some people in Jasper's newest housing development have not been pulling their weight. Smugly protective of my new neighbourhood's image (and known to rant when it comes to individual laziness that disrupts the collective harmony), tonight I am en guard. I am on self-appointed sanitary sentinel duty. I am a citizen on patrol.

Until it starts to feel weird.

It's easy for righteous writers, promise-prone politicians and naive neighbourhood watchers to make pronouncements appealing to our inner environmentalist, but managing our waste in Jasper, Banff and Canmore is like Oscar the Grouch's hoarding complex: it's complicated. Our increased awareness of the natural world is colliding with our ever-constant quandary of convenience over cost. And while there are lots of ways to tackle waste management, there is consensus that the consequences of managing it poorly will sell our future short, both environmentally and economically. In the Rockies, because of our communities' isolation, our close quarters with wildlife and the unique inputs and outputs of a high-volume tourism sector, the Three R's quickly turn into the Three C's: complexity, costliness and contradictions. Where to put the salmon bones is one thing; how to improve our waste diversion efforts is another kettle of fish altogether.

Bear proof = Blame proof

After I realize it's my friend in the shadows and not a hungry grizzly bear, a machete-wielding serial killer, or a gaggle of wine-cooler-drinking 16-year-olds (my worst fears, not necessarily in that order), I remember it wasn't so long ago in Jasper that the fear of bumping into a four-legged dumpster diver was a legitimate concern. Before the community had locking, ursine proof bins installed, black bears and even the occasional grizzly roamed Jasper backyards in search of tasty rewards.

""There was a time when bears were as common as dogs,"" remembers 87-year-old Jasperite, Wanda Garford. ""You couldn't go down an alley without running into a bear.""

Inevitably, human-wildlife conflicts were regular occurrences. As such, when locking-lidded infrastructure was installed in Canada's mountain parks in the 1980s, it was heralded as a great leap forward in managing how humans could live amongst wild animals.

But sealing the garbage off had another effect, although it would be years before it was identified as somewhat counter-intuitive to environmental best practices. In 2007, when the Municipality of Jasper conducted a waste audit, they learned that despite having implemented a residential recycling and compost program, the amount of materials which could have been diverted from the waste stream was more or less the same as when their recycling programs were nascent: somewhere around 30 per cent. And it hasn't improved much since. Those who were historically more inclined to sorting their waste — long-term residents who lived in single family dwellings — continued to do so, while those who were typically poor recyclers and composters — young people living in staff accommodations — remained negligent.

""[The diversion rate] has flat-lined. It's depressing,"" Jasper's Environmental Stewardship Coordinator, Janet Cooper, said in 2010.

At the root of the plateauing waste diversion rates is not just that 20-year-old lifties and weekenders are disinclined to sort their cardboard; rather it's the fact that they aren't compelled to do it — in fact, neither is anyone in Jasper",0.6460214035251202,0.7460214035251201,-0.1,0.0

50th Anniversary Release! The Complete, Uncut Original! 40 Minutes of Unseen Footage!

GODZILLA

Rialto Pictures Presents the Landmark Monster Movie in Its Original Japanese Version, Never Before Released in the U.S.

Uncut, uncensored, and undubbed, the original ""Monster of Mass Destruction"" returns to the big screen like you've never seen him before, fully restored with 40 minutes of unseen footage and completely revised subtitles. See where it all began, with this influential classic that has spawned scores of sequels and imitations, but has never been bettered.

On a sunny day and calm waters, a Japanese steamer sinks in flames when the sea erupts; a salvage vessel sent to the rescue disappears the same way; exhausted, incoherent survivors babble of a monster. Could it be…? GODZILLA was one the biggest budgeted films in Japanese history at that time, costing more than twice as much as the average Japanese movie. An enormous hit, it spawned 50 years of sequels, countless rip-offs, and a new genre: the kaiju eiga, or Japanese monster movie. Sold to an American distributor a year later, it was re-cut, re-arranged, dubbed, and re-titled GODZILLA KING OF THE MONSTERS with added scenes (shot in Hollywood) of a pre-PERRY MASON Raymond Burr observing the action from the sidelines.

The original Japanese GODZILLA is one of the great films by a sci-fi master, Ishiro Honda (Akira Kurosawa's close friend and occasional second unit director). The U.S. cut ran 20 minutes shorter, with another 20 snipped to make room for Burr, so that nearly a third (about 40 minutes) was shorn. The unrelentingly grim American version excised all of the film's comic relief (including some astonishing, Strangelove-like black humor) and censored its strong anti-H-Bomb message, turning it into a run-of-the-mill, monster-on-the-loose picture.

In Japan, the original, un-bastardized GODZILLA is regarded as one of the great classics of the cinema. In 1984, the prestigious film journal Kinema Junpo rated it among the top 20 Japanese films of all time. In 1989, a survey of 370 Japanese movie critics, Nihon Eiga Besuto 150 (Best 150 Japanese Films), ranked Godzilla the 27th greatest Japanese feature ever made.

The real (human) star of the movie is Takashi Shimura (best known for his Kurosawa roles, including the leader of THE SEVEN SAMURAI and the doomed man of IKIRU), as a revered paleontologist who insists that Godzilla must be studied, not destroyed (he's in the minority). This first Godzilla is truly terrifying — a 30-story Jurassic behemoth intent on destroying an exquisitely detailed miniature Tokyo — a tour de force by special effects genius Eiji Tsubaraya. Tsubaraya's use of ""suitmation"" — the often-belittled ""actor in monster suit"" method — was due to time and budget restraints, but, in concert with noirish cinematography, his low-tech approach is still as thrilling as ever. This print also features new subtitles by Bruce Goldstein and Michie Yamakawa.

Duterte, who was in North Cotabato, to facilitate the release of a soldier from the New People's Army, refused to comment at length on the beheading.

""It's too early to comment,"" he said. ""I'm not yet the president of the Philippines. But this has to stop,"" he added.

In Negros Occidental, Liberal Party presidential candidate Mar Roxas expressed his outrage over Ridsdel's beheading.

""The Abu Sayyaf Group must be extinguished,"" he told a press conference in La Carlota City, Negros Occidental.

""I am outraged by the horrific murder of Mr. John Ridsel at the hands of the terrorist Abu Sayyaf. The full force of the state and of the law must be applied to apprehend and bring the perpetrators to justice,"" he added.

He said that since the abduction of Ridsel and the other hostages was reported, all means have been sought to free them.

""Let us double our efforts. Let us not give up hope that the others can be rescued,"" he said, as he appealed for the cooperation and support of all in this mission.

""Terrorism is bullying at its most worst form,"" he said. ""Why kill a defenseless man just to make a point.""

""Terrorism preys on the weak and defenseless. Where is the courage in hurting let alone killing a defenseless person. It does not make you strong. It does not further your cause. It only leads to fear and subjugation which we know is your true purpose and we will not be cowed by that,"" he said.

Roxas extended his condolences to the family, loved ones and fellow citizens of Ridsel.

""The terrorists Abu Sayyaf should be should be neutralized and face the immeasurable consequences of their brutality and inhumanity,"" he said.

He said the 400 Abu Sayyaf members reported to have massed up on Sulu Island, should not be allowed to escape, and should be finished off.

""There is no room for the brutality exercised by the Abu Sayyaf…they must be extinguished,"" he said.

The Abu Sayyaf killed Ridsdel on Monday and dumped his head on a Jolo street, Sulu.

The Abu Sayyaf is still holding another Canadian, a Filipina and a Norwegian resort manager. SFM

The refugee crisis on the Greek islands of Kos, Chios and Lesbos is ""total chaos"", the UN refugee agency UNHCR says, with inadequate accommodation, water and sanitation.

Around 50,000 people arrived in Greece in July alone, the organisation says.

Greece's leader said the country was unable to cope, and called for EU help.

Separately, Italian police arrested five suspected traffickers over the deaths of about 200 people after a migrant boat sank on Wednesday.

They included two Libyans, two Algerians and a Tunisian, held on suspicion of multiple murder and people trafficking.

Survivors have said that traffickers used knives to slash the heads of African migrants and belts to thrash Arabs to keep them in the hull.

The UNHCR says nearly all new arrivals in Greece are refugees from the wars in Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan.

The organisation's European Director, Vincent Cochetel, said facilities for the refugees on the Greek islands were ""totally inadequate"", after more migrants arrived in Greece in July 2015 than in the whole of the previous year.

Greece's EU partners must do more to ease the burden, he said, but Greece must ""lead and co-ordinate"".

""On most of the islands there is no reception capacity, people are not sleeping under any form of roof. So it's total chaos on the islands.

""After a couple of days they are transferred to Athens, there is nothing waiting for them in Athens,"" he complained.

Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras said the problem ""surpasses"" Greece's abilities, and that his country's economic problems meant it was facing a humanitarian ""crisis within a crisis"".

Clarkson was suspended from the BBC after a 'fracas', allegedly with producer Oisin Tymon.

256333,True,754,"Connecticut Attorney General Richard Blumenthal (D) was alternately apologetic and defiant Tuesday as he battled to deflect a potentially devastating blow to his Senate campaign: an accusation that he had exaggerated his military service record.

Blumenthal, his party's presumptive nominee in the contest to succeed retiring Sen. Christopher J. Dodd (D), held a news conference in West Hartford to respond to the New York Times report Monday night that he has lied about serving in Vietnam.

""On a few occasions I have misspoken about my service, and I regret that and I take full responsibility,"" Blumenthal said, flanked by veterans. ""But I will not allow anyone to take a few misplaced words and impugn my record of service to our country.""

Blumenthal joined the Marine Corps Reserves in 1970 and served six years, all in the United States. He has accurately described his service many times in his career, but in 2008, he told an audience at an event in Norwalk: ""We have learned something important since the days that I served in Vietnam. And you exemplify it. Whatever we think about the war, whatever we call it -- Afghanistan or Iraq -- we owe our military men and women unconditional support.""

Blumenthal explained Tuesday that he meant to say he served ""during"" Vietnam, not ""in"" Vietnam. And he stressed that ""there were no special favors, no privileges involved"" in his securing a slot in the Marine Reserves.

The Times article about Blumenthal's military record noted that he received five draft deferments before his enlistment, including one during which he served as an assistant to then-Washington Post Publisher Katharine Graham.

The controversy could place Connecticut's contest among the most competitive Senate races in November. Blumenthal had been heavily favored to win since January, when he plunged into the race after Dodd announced that he would end his foundering reelection bid. Former World Wrestling Entertainment executive Linda McMahon and former U.S. representative Rob Simmons are competing for the Republican nomination.

Stuart Rothenberg, author of the nonpartisan Rothenberg Political Report, said Blumenthal's revelation instantly made the race ""significantly more competitive.""

""He's got a terrible credibility problem here, and I think what makes it so dramatic is this is a guy who had such a squeaky-clean reputation,"" Rothenberg said.

Both Republican candidates pounced on the opportunity to attack Blumenthal.

""The report clearly raises some very serious questions -- questions that cannot be dismissed and aren't easily answered,"" said McMahon spokesman Ed Patru.

There was no sign Tuesday that any national Democrats were abandoning Blumenthal, and Democrats' initial defense was to attempt to turn the story around on McMahon by accusing her of peddling negative information.

Simmons, meanwhile, is in a position to attack Blumenthal from a different angle: He is a decorated Vietnam veteran.

""As someone who served, I respect Richard Blumenthal for wearing the uniform, but I am deeply troubled by allegations that he has misrepresented his service,"" Simmons said in a statement Monday.

An independent poll of the GOP contest taken in March showed McMahon with a 10-point lead over Simmons. Aided by her vast personal wealth, McMahon has also been able to outspend Simmons.

Democrats breathed a sigh of relief when Dodd announced that he would retire after 30 years in the Senate; polls had shown him trailing both Republican candidates. Blumenthal stepped in with high approval ratings, bolstered over his two decades as attorney general by his high-profile crusades against corporate interests. But he has not run in a competitive race for many years and so has avoided the scrutiny such campaigns can bring.",0.8037783695815615,0.8037783695815615,0.0,0.0
258857,False,1024,"There was a time when marijuana was illegal everywhere and testing for it was as easy as could be.

It didn't matter the level of cannabinoids found in a person's body. If it was there, they were breaking the law.

It's different now.

The tests have changed from depositing a urine sample into a cup to drawing blood or offering oral fluids. Also different is the particular type of cannabinoid — the chemical compound that reacts in the brain — detected by any of those tests.

The evolving science of testing for marijuana, and the lack of consensus over how to measure impairment, is a defining feature of the drug. It separates marijuana from alcohol and creates challenges for lawmakers, police and prosecutors, not to mention users.

The issue is critical as the state moves forward in determining how to handle driving under the influence of pot. A Denver Post investigation found that the numbers of drivers in fatal crashes testing positive for marijuana — though not necessarily high — is rising sharply, and coroners are finding higher levels of potency in their tests.

The cannabinoid most widely tested for in the past – known as carboxy THC – is actually an inactive metabolite that only indicates prior marijuana use, sometimes as long as a month ago. In time, other metabolites of THC — short for tetrahydrocannabinal, the psychoactive ingredient in marijuana — were found to be better indicators of recent use and, some say, impairment.

""Urine testing was established many years ago, and, at the time, a test was developed to look for carboxy THC since it's what's there in the highest amount,"" said Sarah Urfer, president and owner of ChemaTox, a Boulder lab that handles DUI screening for about three quarters of the law enforcement agencies in Colorado. ""Nobody thought it mattered what you were looking for. … Early on, scientists didn't know for sure which of the cannabinoids were responsible for impairment. They'd measure carboxy and try to correlate it to impairment.""

But THC is not the same as alcohol. It reacts differently in the body, it metabolizes differently and its impairing impact is different. Unlike the 0.08 blood-alcohol level that's widely accepted as indicative of drunken driving, establishing a credible level for THC has been elusive.

It is generally accepted that two standard drinks — about 1/2 ounce of alcohol — in an hour will raise someone's blood-alcohol level to 0.05, approaching the legal limit. One drink is a 12-ounce beer, a 1.5-ounce shot of distilled spirit, or a 6-ounce glass of wine.

For pot, the differences are striking since it depends on the manner ingested — smoked, edible, concentrate — and how much. A Johns Hopkins University study from 1995 found that four puffs of smokable marijuana with 1.75 percent THC content translates to 57 nanograms per milliliter, and 10 puffs as much as 99 ng/mL. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration says levels of 100-200 ng/mL are ""routinely encountered"" after smoking but quickly dissipate.

Concentrate levels for vapor ingestion are typically higher, as well as for edibles, although the rate of distribution into the blood varies considerably.

Feds question tests

NHTSA last month acknowledged these gray areas in a report to Congress that not only called into question the reliability of tests to find THC but also noted the problem with determining whether a driver is too stoned to be behind the wheel.


In fact, the NHTSA report notes that even though ""research has demonstrated the potential of marijuana to impair driving-related skills,"" it lays out a number of other studies that show pot might not be as bad as the better-understood effects of alcohol on driving.

""Many studies, using a variety of methods, have attempted to estimate the risk of driving after use of marijuana,"" the NHTSA report noted. ""While useful in identifying how marijuana affects the performance of driving tasks, experimental and observational studies do not lend themselves to predicting real-world crash risk.""

Finding THC isn't so difficult. Making any kind of universally accepted determination from the results, however, seems to freeze the legal world in its tracks.

""Testing for THC in whole blood isn't actually that hard,"" Urfer said. ""Where the issue comes is with interpretation and roadside testing.""

Some widely cited studies have offered differing information about the impact of marijuana on driving. And not all sides agree which studies are right and which are not.

In 2012, a medical study published in Clinical Chemistry journal found ""cannabis smoking increases lane weaving and impaired cognitive functions,"" and that certain THC concentration levels ""are associated with substantial driving impairment, particularly in occasional smokers.""

Former senator and Democratic presidential candidate John Edwards is beginning his criminal trial on felony and misdemeanor counts dating back to his failed campaign. One of the key allegations against Edwards is that he received $1 million in illegal campaign contributions to conceal his pregnant mistress. Edwards says he wasn't in the right, but he wasn't breaking the law either. In response to this fiasco, world affairs columnist Frida Ghitis has just one question.

Are men stupid?

Male readers were outraged.

Fangle620: ""Yes, because no powerful women in history have ever had an affair. Not like certain powerful British (female) monarchs ever built their power on affairs. I'm a historian, I would know. This obviously has way too much bias, poor research, and too much hatred for men. Get a grip."" BlameMe: ""Both men and women can be stupid when it comes to love, lust and passion. This is not by any means gender-based."" ozfozzy: ""Men aren't stupid for fulfilling their biological purpose in life. The author is stupid for failing to understand men.""

To be fair, some women joined in the cause.

fin59: ""First, I am a woman. So to Frida, get your head out of the sand! Women have dalliances as well. Maybe we are better at it but we do it just the same. This 'crime,' if you want to call it that, has the same risk as many other crimes humans commit. Why do women shoplift? Is it arrogance? Not that simple. The behavior is inexcusable, but these men are just as human as every one of us. Get over yourself!"" dabble53: ""Have to agree. At least 90% of the time, if the man is having an affair, there's a woman equally involved. (The other – up to 10% estimates – it's another man, but in any case, it takes two [or more] to have an affair.)""

OK, so maybe men are stupid, says this reader.

Bonvivant251: ""Men probably are pretty stupid for the following reasons: (a) We stick around with thankless women who we marry for some reason because we have a sense of obligation to them; (b) We go to war to protect our country and die in far greater numbers than women to protect them based upon our principle that it is the right thing to do. (c) We establish a legal system that rewards women for getting divorced while penalizing men. (d) We keep working while women take the easy way out and become stay-at-home moms - an option not available to most men - even today. (e) We continue to allow women to make all the choices regarding whether to have a child, whether to abort a child, and how that child is to be raised, while we pay more than half of the freight to bring that child up. (e) We tolerate the kind of hatred and bias espoused by this author with a shrug while armies of angry women ride us down for being stupid and, at the same time, nearly all major inventions, technological breakthroughs and advancement in civilization generally has come at the hands of men. So ... 'Are men stupid?' The answer is 'yeah, maybe we are' ... but we are also practical and we can wise up really quickly.""

The responses to this comment hinted at something many readers said: Men are at a disadvantage when it comes to disputes related to family and marriage. And there were also women who expressed support for men.

sameeker: ""This post is very well stated. women are pretty smart given the way that they have played the divorce system."" EaglesQuestions: ""As a woman, I honestly do not think that men are stupid. People have too little respect for one another these days, and this author had no business posting such a thing.""

Some debate took place about women's interest in sexual interactions.

Capitalism9: ""When you are hungry, you seek food. When you are thirsty, you seek water. I have always chuckled how feminists think that they can just show up to marriage, and that's all they have to do. No sex, no conversation, no ability to take an interest in what your partner likes in life. I once met a woman who declared that she will be married by 30, but had no interest in sex, conversation, or any of her possible future husband's dealings in life. Needless to say men ignore her like the plague. Remember ladies, if you don't get the job done in the bedroom, best believe somebody else in your gender will.

259001,False,1024,"By Bob Salsberg, The Associated Press

BOSTON — Changing marijuana laws aren't necessarily making weed more welcome in the workplace.

For now, many employers appear to be sticking with their drug testing and personal conduct policies, even in states where recreational marijuana use is now permitted. Others are keeping a close eye on the still evolving legal, regulatory and political environment.

Voters in California, Massachusetts, Maine and Nevada voted Nov. 8 to approve the use of recreational marijuana, joining Colorado, Washington, Oregon and Alaska, where it had previously been legalized. (A recount of Maine's close result is scheduled.) More than two dozen states have medical marijuana programs.

But the drug is still against federal law.

A closer look at what it all means for workers and businesses:

CAN MY EMPLOYER STILL TEST ME FOR POT?

Bottom line: You can't come to work high. You can still be drug tested. And you can still be fired — or not hired — for failing a drug test even if you're not the least bit impaired at work.

All the states with legalized recreational pot have exemptions for workplace drug policies.

In Massachusetts, for example, the law includes language stating that ""the authority of employers to enact and enforce workplace policies restricting the consumption of marijuana by employees"" is not changed.

""Yes, you may be able to have (marijuana) at home, but that doesn't mean it's OK in the workplace,"" said Edward Yost, an HR specialist with the Society for Human Resources Management.

WHAT ABOUT WORKPLACE SAFETY?

Advocates for marijuana legalization said it was never their intention to compromise safety, a central reason offered by employers for drug testing.

""We don't want anyone to come to work impaired on any drugs,"" said David Boyer, campaign manager for the ballot initiative in Maine.

A 2013 survey by the employee screening firm HireRight found 78 percent of employers conducted drug tests either randomly, as a condition of employment, after accidents or for some combination of those reasons.

The federal government requires drug testing for some workers, including truck drivers and others in transportation.

Quest Diagnostics, which performed nearly 11 million laboratory-based drug tests for employers in 2015, said the percentage of tests coming back positive has shown a modest increase in recent years. Nearly half of all positive tests showed evidence of marijuana use.

CAN I GET FIRED EVEN IF I'M NOT HIGH?

THC, the psychoactive chemical in cannabis, can stay in a person's system for days or even weeks, experts say — long after the buzz has subsided.

""It's the equivalent of firing somebody who drank a glass of wine on Friday evening and then came to work on Monday,"" said Tamar Todd, legal director for the Drug Policy Alliance, who believes employers should reconsider zero-tolerance policies in light of changing laws and attitudes.

A number of efforts are underway to develop an accurate method, akin to the Breathalyzer for alcohol, to measure actual marijuana impairment. Such a test might be useful not only for employers, but also for police and prosecutors trying to determine what constitutes driving under the influence of marijuana in states where recreational pot is legal.

WHAT SHOULD COMPANIES DO?

At a minimum, companies should review their current polices, make sure their managers are trained and make clear to employees that marijuana use on or off the job can still land them in trouble, said James Reidy, a New Hampshire-based attorney who advises clients around the country on drug testing issues.

Tina Sharby, chief human resources officer for an Easter Seals affiliate with about 1,700 employees in New England, said the organization, which provides services for people with special needs, is monitoring the evolving legal and regulatory environment but is sticking with its drug testing protocols for now.

""We have a drug-free workplace policy, and we believe that the current policy we have is effective,"" Sharby said.

But drug testing and zero-tolerance rules can make it difficult for businesses with a need to recruit young professionals who may harbor more liberal attitudes toward pot.

""We have ski industries out here, and if they really took a hard line on marijuana use, they would have to shut down,"" said Curtis Graves, information resource manager for the Colorado-based Mountain States Employers Council.

After Colorado became the first state to legalize recreational marijuana in 2012, surveys showed an uptick in workplace drug testing, Graves said, but that trend has begun to shift in the other direction.

""Employers who have a zero-tolerance policy maybe shouldn't apply that to non-safety sensitive workers, because if they do testing on them, they run the risk of inviting an invasion of privacy claim,"" suggested Amanda Baer, a Boston-area attorney who specializes in labor and employment issues.

Tuesday 9:45 p.m. | Philosophy undergraduates vote to end strike

The Philosophy Students' Association (PSA) voted today at a general assembly (GA) in the SSMU cafeteria not to renew the unlimited strike it initially declared on March 28. The original strike mandate stipulated that it be renewed every five academic days. The vote was 44 in favour of renewal, 68 against, and 6 abstentions. PSA co-president Emma Ryman estimates that turnout equaled about 29 per cent of the roughly 400 Philosophy undergraduates at McGill that the PSA represents. The PSA allowed students to vote by proxy and email in their votes, and 62 of the 118 votes cast were online. Students who attended the GA but had to leave early were also able to record their vote in a book before leaving. At least two-thirds of the three-hour-long GA was spent discussing online voting, and a motion was passed to ratify the way in which online voting would occur in future strike-vote GAs. Although coupled with online votes the motion to renew the strike failed, a clear majority of those voting from the floor of the GA voted in favour of renewal, with 13 opposing the motion, 23 in favour, and one abstention. 17 students recorded their vote in the book, with nine voting against renewing the strike, seven in favour, and one abstention. — Lola Duffort

Monday 7:05 p.m. | AHCSSA inches above quorum and renews strike

The Art History and Communications Studies' Students' Association (AHCSSA)held a General Assembly (GA) tonight and voted to renew its unlimited general strike . Exceeding the sixty student-minimum quorum by only two people, 28 students voted against continuing the strike, with 33 voting in favour.

AHCSSA Co-President and former Daily Health and Education Editor Joseph Henry noted the consistent drop in attendance from their initial strike vote last week, which he said over 100 students attended, as well as at strike votes in general across campus.

""Next Tuesday, it's going to be a very big challenge to get quorum,"" said Henry, referring to the AHCSSA's next strike renewal vote.

Reaching quorum, he said, ""is contingent on the actions of the strike committee"" in terms of informing students and increasing visibility of the strike on campus.

The GA made one amendment to the motion, specifying the hard picket tactics may be employed against professors but not students. Henry said he thought the tactic could be ""a really useful and good idea.""

""It seems less antagonistic to students…while having a more effective strike action,"" he continued.

The AHCSSA had been adopting soft picketing for most of the past week, and Henry said the executive had yet to receive any ""huge complaints.""

""From what the strike committee has told me [last week's strike] was very effective,"" he said. ""But in terms of the overall goal of the strike, which is to stop classes from happening, I don't think that's been happening.""

256919,True,833,"Update: They did the exact same segment on Smackdown Tuesday night.

Every October, the WWE is awash in a sea of pink—trotting out its pink ring ropes and ribbons in commemoration of breast cancer awareness month. It's a noble endeavor that a high-profile sports-entertainment company would commit so much primetime air for a cause that afflicts one out of every eight women in their lifetime. For that, the WWE—and their partnership with the Susan G. Komen Foundation—should be commended.


On last night's episode of Monday Night Raw from Denver, a segment aired where the Raw women's roster, breaking kayfabe, stood in the ring as a unit, as three breast cancer survivors were presented with WWE championship belts. Some watched and might have thought, ""that's a nice gesture."" My reaction was more of discomfort.

The segment was hosted by Dana Warrior, widow of the wrestler Ultimate Warrior, who died suddenly three days after being inducted in the WWE Hall of Fame in 2014. In WWE's telling of the Ultimate Warrior narrative, the man born Jim Hellwig exemplified a fighting spirit, who never gave up, and lived every moment of his 57-year life like it was his last—essentially, a living embodiment of a motivational speech. ""Please join me in honoring their warrior spirit!"" Dana Warrior said to cheers from the Denver crowd.

Seeing these three women in Warrior shirts on WWE isn't just bringing attention to breast cancer, though—it's also posthumously rewriting the long history of Warrior's hateful diatribes. Although we don't know how he would have felt about WWE participating in breast cancer awareness month, we do know about his treatment of many others. He said that gay men suffered from the same ""disease"" as pedophile priests. At a speech he delivered in 2005 at the University of Connecticut, Warrior (he legally changed his name from Hellwig) remarked ""queering don't make the world work."" Our colleagues at Deadspin has a far more complete anthology of Warrior's many disparaging and hateful remarks.

Since Warrior's death, the WWE has established what it calls the Warrior Award, presented during its annual Hall of Fame ceremony. In a long show with plenty of levity and insider wrestling references, the Warrior Award is the serious part of the proceedings. The company has given the award to an eight-year-old WWE fan who died of cancer, a Rutgers football player who was paralyzed on the field and became a motivational speaker, and former morning show host and cancer survivor Joan Lunden. It's hard to watch this and not get swept up by the emotions of it all. But every year I watch it, something in the back of my head can't get over the man whom the WWE named this award after. He literally once wished cancer would kill off Bobby Heenan. It's as if Warrior, who ostensibly said Hurricane Katrina victims were fat and poor and had it coming, never happened.

On Tuesday's episode of Wrestling Observer Radio (subscriber only), Dave Meltzer—the country's preeminent pro wrestling journalist—expressed the same distaste about the segment.


""The lionizing of Warrior really bothers me, especially right now. He said stuff worse than almost anybody when he was alive... it really rubs me the wrong way,"" Meltzer said. ""I just find this whole thing, of somehow, breast cancer survivors wearing Ultimate Warrior T-shirts for this guy who said all that hateful gay stuff. I found it very repugnant. It didn't wash well with me.""

The Monday Night Raw segment was just a continuation of WWE's remaking of its backstory in a more flattering light.

257118,True,780,"The Healthy Michigan plan paid for by the Affordable Care Act's Medicaid expansion likely wouldn't be sustainable under the expansion phase-out included in the repeal and replace proposal being pushed by House Republican leadership, Gov. Rick Snyder said Friday.

Snyder, who co-wrote a letter this week with Ohio Gov. John Kasich, Nevada Gov. Brian Sandoval and Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson regarding the American Health Care Act, said he has serious concerns with the proposal on several fronts, including its plan to deal with the insurance marketplace and its potential to impact Michigan's traditional Medicaid program.

But the changes, if implemented, could have the biggest immediate impact on the Healthy Michigan program, which currently enrolls more than 650,000 Michigan residents. Snyder said the additional costs of paying for any new entries after 2020 under the American Health Care Act would cost the state $800 million more a year, ""and that's not affordable.""

""Essentially what you'd find is Healthy Michigan sort of winding down, where probably over 90 percent of the people on it would move out of the program within three years,"" Snyder said in an interview with MLive Friday. ""That's a huge number, and it's difficult to see where that would come from"" in the state budget.

Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder critical of GOP health care plan

That estimate is in line with a state Senate Fiscal Agency report released March 8, which found that if the Healthy Michigan statute was changed to continue the program if the American Health Care Act was implemented, the increased cost to the state would grow to $532.6 million in Fiscal Year 2020-21 and $738.9 million in Fiscal Year 2021-22.

Included in the letter to House and Senate leadership are suggestions Snyder and the other governors made to improve upon the American Health Care Act, including giving states more leeway to set up per capita systems, block grants or maintaining the current structure, depending on the needs of individual states.

Snyder said he believes Michigan's program so far has been successful, and said some reform options could ""make Healthy Michigan even better than our traditional Medicaid program.""

""We have people that are better off today - I clearly believe that's the case,"" Snyder said. ""Instead of being in the emergency room, they're now getting primary care. If you think about it, that's a better answer for them in terms of their quality of life, and it's a better answer for society, because in the long term that should save us resources.""

Although Snyder said he did not have time to discuss health care with the president when he visited the American Center for Mobility in Ypsilanti Wednesday, he said President Donald Trump, his administration and Republican members of Congress have been good about reaching out and hearing the concerns of governors.

He said he's hopeful some of the recommendations made by he and the other governors make it into the final proposal at the federal level: ""I think there's good dialogue going on, but I would hope they could incorporate it if not in the House plan, than in the Senate plan,"" he said.

The GOP plan, dubbed the American Health Care Act, would phase out the Medicaid expansion and switch to a new funding Medicaid formula in which states get a set amount of dollars instead of the federal government guaranteeing to cover a certain percentage of Medicaid costs.

The plan also would change the current insurance subsidies based on income to one based on age, which means younger people would get more help to buy insurance but many older people would see higher out-of-pocket costs.

In addition, the GOP plan would eliminate the requirement for Americans to purchase insurance, although they would have to pay a 30 percent penalty on premiums for a year if they go more than two months without coverage.",0.5262585742965988,0.7262585742965988,-0.2,0.0

The U.S.-led coalition against Islamic State airdropped Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) fighters some 15 km (10 miles) from the dam at the town of Tabqa on Tuesday night. The SDF established a base from which to advance on the Tabqa area.

Tabqa is around 40 km (25 miles) west of Raqqa. Islamic State captured the Tabqa Dam, also known as the Euphrates Dam, and the nearby air base at the height of its expansion in Syria and Iraq in 2014.

SDF spokesman Talal Silo said the SDF forces had yet to reach Tabqa town or the nearby airport and dam. He described these as three strategically important targets and said the SDF planned to repair and use the airport once it was captured.

""Today or at most tomorrow there will be an attack operation on these three areas,"" he said in a phone interview.

He said that once captured, the air base runway would be repaired and ""in the near future our forces will use this airport.""

""In all the areas under our control, we do not have an airport that can receive planes,"" he said. ""The coalition planes will benefit from the airport.""

The SDF has been working since November to encircle Raqqa city with support from U.S. special forces and air strikes by the U.S.-led coalition against Islamic State. The SDF comprises the powerful Kurdish YPG militia and allied Arab fighters.

The campaign appears to be gathering pace as an overlapping, U.S.-backed effort in Iraq is drawing closer to driving Islamic State from Mosul.

255299,False,1024,"Preferring composition isn't just about polymorphism. Although that is part of it, and you are right that (at least in nominally typed languages) what people really mean is ""prefer a combination of composition and interface implementation."" But, the reasons to prefer composition (in many circumstances) are profound.

Polymorphism is about one thing behaving multiple ways. So, generics/templates are a ""polymorphic"" feature in so far as they allow a single piece of code to vary its behavior with types. In-fact, this type of polymorphism is really the best behaved and is generally referred to as parametric polymorphism because the variation is defined by a parameter.

Many languages provide a form of polymorphism called ""overloading"" or ad hoc polymorphism where multiple procedures with the same name are defined in an ad hoc manner, and where one is chosen by the language (perhaps the most specific). This is the least well behaved kind of polymorphism, since nothing connects the behavior of the two procedures except developed convention.

A third kind of polymorphism is subtype polymorphism. Here a procedure defined on a given type, can also work on a whole family of ""subtypes"" of that type. When you implement an interface or extend a class you are generally declaring your intention to create a subtype. True subtypes are governed by Liskov's Substitution Principle, which says that if you can prove something about all objects in a supertype you can prove it about all instances in a subtype. Life gets dangerous though, since in languages like C++ and Java, people generally have unenforced, and often undocumented assumptions about classes which may or may not be true about their subclasses. That is, code is written as if more is provable than it really is, which produces a whole host of issues when you subtype carelessly.

Inheritance is actually independent of polymorphism. Given some thing ""T"" which has a reference to itself, inheritance happens when you create a new thing ""S"" from ""T"" replacing ""T""s reference to itself with a reference to ""S"". That definition is intentionally vague, since inheritance can happen in many situations, but the most common is subclassing an object which has the effect of replacing the this pointer called by virtual functions with the this pointer to the subtype.

Inheritance is a dangerous like all very powerful things inheritance has the power to cause havoc. For example, suppose you override a method when inheriting from some class: all is well and good until some other method of that class assumes the method you inherit to behave a certain way, after all that is how the author of the original class designed it. You can partially protect against this by declaring all methods called by another of your methods private or non-virtual (final), unless they are designed to be overridden. Even this though isn't always good enough. Sometimes you might see something like this (in pseudo Java, hopefully readable to C++ and C# users)

interface UsefulThingsInterface { void doThings(); void doMoreThings(); } ... class WayOfDoingUsefulThings implements UsefulThingsInterface{ private foo stuff; public final int getStuff(); void doThings(){ //modifies stuff, such that ... ... } ... void doMoreThings(){ //ignores stuff ... } }

you think this is lovely, and have your own way of doing ""things"", but you use inheritance to acquire the ability to do ""moreThings"",

class MyUsefulThings extends WayOfDoingUsefulThings{ void doThings { //my way } }

And all is well and good. WayOfDoingUsefulThings was designed in such a way that replacing one method doesn't change the semantics of any other... except wait, no it wasn't. It just looks like it was, but doThings changed mutable state that mattered. So, even though it didn't call any override-able functions,

void dealWithStuff(WayOfDoingUsefulThings bar){ bar.doThings() use(bar.getStuff()); }

now does something different than expected when you pass it a MyUsefulThings . Whats worse, you might not even know that WayOfDoingUsefulThings made those promises. Maybe dealWithStuff comes from the same library as WayOfDoingUsefulThings and getStuff() isn't even exported by the library (think of friend classes in C++). Worse still, you have defeated the static checks of the language without realizing it: dealWithStuff took a WayOfDoingUsefulThings just to make sure that it would have a getStuff() function that behaved a certain way.

Nykea Aldridge, 32, and a man were walking in the 6300 block of South Calumet Avenue about 3:30 p.m. Friday, authorities and the family spokesman said. Police said on Friday that two men approached Aldridge and the man and began firing at the man, and it was unclear whether he was hit by gunfire.

Aldridge, who was pushing her baby in a stroller, was hit in the head and the arm and taken to Stroger Hospital, where she died, police said. The baby was not hurt, and a relative came to the scene and took the child, police said.

Police said Aldridge, a mother of four young children, including the baby who is just weeks old, was an unintended target.

Wade has only commented publicly about the tragedy through his Twitter account, posting on Saturday: ""RIP Nykea Aldridge... #EnoughIsEnough"" as well as ""The city of Chicago is hurting. We need more help & more hands on deck.""

Aldridge's slaying is not the first time a relative of Wade's, who signed with the Bulls as a free agent in the offseason, has been a victim of violence.

In late March 2012, Wade's nephew Darin Johnson was shot twice in the leg when two gunmen opened fire in a South Side convenience store. One man was killed and five, including Johnson, were injured.

Newly minted Chicago Bull and Robbins, Ill., native Dwyane Wade participated in an ESPN town hall on athletes, social responsibility and gun violence held at a South Side YMCA on Aug. 25, 2016, a day before his 32-year-old cousin was shot and killed in the Parkway Gardens neighborhood, also on Chicago's South Side.

But this latest blow to Wade's family came just a day after Wade was interviewed about growing up in Chicago's violent streets as part of an ESPN program taped at the South Side YMCA called ""An Undefeated Conversation: Athletes, Responsibility, and Violence."" The program also included Wade's mother, Jolinda, a local pastor who spoke to reporters Friday after her niece's death. Jolinda Wade, whose sister is Aldridge's mother, is a pastor at New Creation Binding and Loosing Ministries at 129th and Halsted streets, where a 1 p.m. Sunday prayer service is planned in honor of the slain woman.

Wade spoke about being insulated from the influence of gang violence and drugs by his family. ""My experience, when I was (in Chicago), it was a lot of us killing us,"" Wade told host Jemele Hill, adding that he has tried to assist youth with his Wade's World Foundation.

Six years ago, while playing for the Miami Heat, Wade met with and gave gifts to the family of Kevin Jones, a South Side high school basketball player who idolized Wade, after the 15-year-old was killed by a stray bullet at a graduation party.

256064,True,620,"WASHINGTON, April 1, 2016 – Canadian health experts have determined that ""registered products containing 2,4-D are acceptable for continued registration"" under current use conditions, painting a sharp contrast to decisions made by some other governments.

The decision by Health Canada's Pest Management Regulatory Agency (PMRA) comes as part of a special review, triggered in part by Norway's decision in 2000 to prohibit the use of products containing 2,4-D. The conclusion is consistent with the PMRA's previous reviews, including the re-evaluation decisions in 2005, 2007, 2008, and 2013.

The PMRA review determined that all forms of 2,4-D are not mutagenic or genotoxic and that ""the overall weight of evidence indicates that 2,4-D is not carcinogenic in rats, mice, and dogs.""

In addition to the toxicity studies in animals, the PMRA considered expert assessments from numerous epidemiological studies on human exposure.

The agency reported that ""while some of the studies suggest a possible association between 2,4-D exposure and increase in these tumors in humans, other epidemiological studies fail to support such association. Furthermore, it was concluded that the available epidemiological studies provide ""equivocal or no evidence for an association between exposure to 2,4-D (and other chlorophenoxy herbicides) and other human cancers, including prostate, breast, pancreatic, colorectal, and brain cancers.""

In addition, the PMRA did not find any concerns related to the environment.

""The PMRA's assessment of scientific data base is another, consistent regulatory decision that concludes the use of 2,4‑D not only protects food production but also the environment,"" stated Jim Gray, Executive Director of the Industry Task Force II on 2,4‑D Research Data. The Task Force includes representatives of companies holding technical 2,4-D registrations: Dow AgroSciences (U.S.), Nufarm, Ltd. (Australia) and Agro-Gor Corp., a U.S. corporation jointly owned by Albaugh, LLC. (U.S.) and PBI-Gordon Corp. (U.S.).

""With this most recent regulatory decision, Canadian farmers, ranchers, grain producers, forestry and green space managers will be able to continue deriving benefit from the many low-cost, effective uses of 2,4-D,"" Gray added.

The PMRA will now accept written comments on the review decision for the next 45 days. For more information on the decision, click here:

You and 1M others like this.

Outgoing Rep. Jason Chaffetz (R-UT) lashed out at the Trump administration recently for being ""worse"" than the Obama administration when it comes to transparency.

ADVERTISING inRead invented by Teads

In an interview with Sinclair broadcasting's Sharyl Attkisson that aired on Sunday, the House Oversight Committee Chairman who spent millions crusading against Hillary Clinton explained why he was not hopeful about the government under President Donald Trump.

""The reality is, sadly, I don't see much difference between the Trump administration and the Obama administration,"" Chaffetz told the conservative host. ""I thought there would be this, these floodgates would open up with all the documents we wanted from the Department of State, the Department of Justice, the Pentagon.""

""In many ways, it's almost worse because we're getting nothing, and that's terribly frustrating and, with all due respect, the attorney general has not changed at all,"" he added. ""I find him to be worse than what I saw with Loretta Lynch in terms of releasing documents and making things available. I just, that's my experience, and that's not what I expected.""

Chaffetz, who abruptly announced plans to retire earlier this year, accused members of Congress of refusing to ""play offense"" against the executive branch.

""Congress doesn't stand up for itself. I think it's, it's really lost its way,"" he insisted. ""Even getting people to come up and testify before Congress, the Obama administration at the end of their term, they got so brazen they stopped sending people up. They just didn't care. And, and there was no way to enforce that, and until that changes, uh, the legislative branch is going to get weaker and weaker.""

255057,False,1024,"In a country where racial classifications create social hierarchies that assert the superiority of white skin and Caucasian features, and the inferiority of ""black"" skin and Asian features, interracial and interethnic couples in Lebanon are abhorred, stigmatized and socially ostracised.

""I'm a stranger in my own country,"" Saeb Kayali, a Thai-Lebanese, told Al-Akhbar.

""Demeaning gestures, head-shaking, stares, and under-the-breath comments are the most passive of the reactions we get in public,"" ""I remember once a woman asked my friend, who happened to be right next to me, if I spoke Arabic,"" Kayali said, ""And I always get questions like 'Where are you from? Lebanon. No, where are you really from? Ummm, Lebanon. No, like where are your parents originally from?' And even after I explicitly tell them that I'm Lebanese they just continue asking.""

As Kayali narrated countless instances of ""misunderstandings,"" Lebanon's racial bigotry, whether conscious or unconscious, and the long-ingrained notions of racial inequality, are very clearly present in today's society.

Power institutions, including the societal body, are not only combating interfaith marriages but also interracial ones. While the need to overcome the former has vigorously surfaced in the last few years, the latter is still to be acknowledged and defied.

Blatant racism

""Demeaning gestures, head-shaking, stares, and under-the-breath comments are the most passive of the reactions we get in public,"" Pi, a Filipina woman married to a Lebanese man, told Al-Akhbar.

Racial intolerance in Lebanon has caused the alienation of mixed-race couples from family members, who disown them for marrying someone they consider to be 'inferior.' People of African or Asian heritage are automatically associated with allegedly 'inferior' domestic workers by virtue of their phenotype, and their identity is accordingly erased and replaced by an array of racist stereotypes.

""At first we didn't even hold hands in public. Then I asked him how is it okay for others to express hatred but not for us to express love?"" Pi added, ""now we act like any endogamous couple and if someone is disturbed he or she can simply look away.""

""His family didn't speak to him for five years,"" Pi said, ""they didn't even know me, but my Filipina features were more than enough reason for them to disapprove of our marriage.""

According to Rana Boukarim, spokeswoman for the Anti Racism Movement in Lebanon, ""Many families eventually come to accept the interracial marriages, which may be seen as a decrease in racism. However, when questioned, these family members, who were initially against the idea, often say 'but she is different from other Filipinas'.""

Moreover, couples who are driven by love to cross the color line face socially-constructed derision because they, and their mixed-race children, provoke the invisible yet existing laws of racial segregation.

""They used to call me Oreo""

""I remember one time, light-skinned Lebanese students refused to sit next to an Afro-Lebanese kid because they thought his dark skin color was 'contagious' and they feared they would turn black."" Mixed-race children face blatant racism at school as their fellow classmates fail to censor their speech. While interracial couples are mentally and psychologically aware of notions of race and the difficulties that might be ahead in ethnically homogenous communities, their children are not.

""Back in preschool, kids used to call me 'blacky' or 'Oreo' as if my skin color is my name and identity,"" Walid Yassine, a 22-year-old Congolese-Lebanese told Al-Akhbar.

""I was called 'the Chinese kid',"" Kayali said, ""even though I'm not half Chinese to begin with.""

Thrust into a world of racial stereotyping, mixed-race children experience disparities in self-esteem, self-degradation, and identity-related struggles. Unless the child is aware of his or her mixed heritage, overcoming the internal turmoil that could result from such confusion could take a lifetime.

""I felt different and I knew I looked different but I didn't understand why I was treated differently,"" Gabi Kheil, a 24-year-old Gabonese-Lebanese told Al-Akhbar.

According to Charles Nasrallah, founder and director of Insan Association, when introducing an Afro-Lebanese to a class full of light-skinned Lebanese children the first reaction has always been very aggressive and abusive.

McDonald's reported fourth-quarter revenues and earnings that easily topped analysts' forecasts, led by a 5.7% jump in same-store sales in the United States.

CEO Steve Easterbrook, who took over at McDonald's nearly a year ago, said the company's introduction of its all day breakfast menu in October was the main reason that U.S. sales did so well.

Many McDonald's fans had been calling on the company for years to make Egg McMuffins, hash browns and other early morning treats available at lunch or dinner time. The menu change clearly has paid off for Mickey D's.

Easterbrook also said that mild weather in the quarter helped.

This was the second consecutive quarter of domestic same-store sales growth for the fast food giant. But McDonald's isn't just staging an impressive comeback in its home market. Same-store sales rose 5% worldwide.

The company said there was broad strength across Asia and Europe -- and solid sales gains in emerging markets like Russia and China.

Related: Burger King, Wendy's and McDonald's in fast food price war

Shares of McDonald's (MCD) were up 1% in late morning trading Monday and hit a new all-time high. McDonald's was one of the top stocks in the Dow last year and has held up well so far in what's been a volatile 2016.

McDonald's has outperformed rivals such as Burger King owner Restaurant Brands (QSR), Wendy's (WEN) and KFC/Taco Bell parent Yum Brands (YUM). It also has done better than some popular fast casual restaurants -- chains like Panera (PNRA) and Chipotle (CMG).

Related: McDonald's not planning to spin off its real estate assets

Easterbrook deserves credit for owning up to many of the big problems facing the company -- most notably a stale menu that did little to excite the taste buds of its customers.

Many diners were shunning McDonald's in favor of places like Five Guys, Smashburger and Shake Shack (SHAK).

But since Easterbrook became CEO, McDonald's has added several new burgers -- such as the Pico Guacamole and Buffalo Bacon -- and also gave diners more choices so they could customize the sandwiches.

It also launched a new Buttermilk Crispy Chicken sandwich.

It was all part of Easterbrook's strategy to turn McDonald's into a ""modern, progressive burger company"" -- marketing jargon for tastier and fresher food.

Related: McDonald's selling more gourmet burgers

""We took bold, urgent action in 2015 to reset the business and position McDonald's to deliver sustained profitable growth,"" said Easterbrook in the company's earnings release Monday.

During a conference call with analysts, Easterbrook said that all day breakfast sales exceeded the company's expectations. But he predicted that some of the euphoria will fade following the launch in October.

That's one reason why the company is experimenting with other new menu items this year as well. It recently introduced mozzarella sticks and is considering launches of mac and cheese and sweet potato fries too.

Neil Saunders, CEO of research firm Conlumino, said in a report Monday that the new offerings -- as well as all day breakfast -- has been ""successful in attracting back lost customers, especially over the important lunchtime period.""

During the conference call, Easterbrook said the restaurant chain is definitely recovering market share it lost over the past few years and gaining customers from its burger rivals and other fast food (or quick service) competitors.

The company is also trying to hang on to consumers don't want to spend that much when they go to McDonald's.

Easterbrook said about a quarter of its customers are very value conscious. And that's a big reason why McDonald's has recently introduced a McPick $2 menu -- 2 items for 2 dollars.

He also said the company will continue to invest more on better food quality and service to keep its momentum going.",0.2571103172749417,0.7571103172749417,-0.5,0.0
258801,True,808,"Conservative councillor and parliamentary candidate Mike Whitehead has become the latest person to defect to Ukip to much praise from Nigel Farage, but his former party insist they struck him off last week.

Whitehead currently sits on East Riding Council and was in place to fight for the Labour safe seat Hull West and Hessle constituency for the Tories but announced on Monday he would be joining the anti-EU party.

Just spoken to Tory parliamentary candidate for Hull West and Hessle, Mike Whitehead, who has now left the Conservatives and joined UKIP! — Nigel Farage (@Nigel_Farage) April 6, 2015

Nigel Farage described the news as ""another hammer blow to Tory pretensions in the north of England"", but a Conservative Party spokesperson dismissed the announcement.

He said: ""This man is not our candidate for Hull West and Hessle. He was sacked last week.

""He refused to support the local Conservative council candidate and so we wrote to him last week to say that his position was untenable and he could not stand for us at the general election.

""We were already selecting a new candidate for this constituency.

""This is typical Ukip - cynical, misleading and utterly calculating to try and score political points.""

Mike Whitehead

When asked if they were aware of Whitehead's sacking, a Ukip spokesperson said: ""I am now.

""It's possible he told someone else in the party. It was an oversight.""

Whitehead has since admitted to BBC Radio 5 Live he was deselected, and the Conservative Party have released a copy of an email sent to him last week.

Here is the email the tories claim they sent Mike Whitehead sacking him as a candidate on 1 April: pic.twitter.com/f1bCIjJT7H — Harry Cole (@MrHarryCole) April 6, 2015

Farage said: ""I am delighted to be welcoming Mike to the party at this exciting time.

""His move to Ukip just underlines that today the real party of opposition to Labour in the north is Ukip.""

Whitehead said he had been increasingly worried about the behaviour of the controlling group of Tories since 2011, when seven Conservative councillors from Haltemprice and Howden resigned, citing bullying and intimidation.

He added: ""In my opinion, the behaviour of the ruling group has only gotten worse since then.

""Now, that same group have managed to gain control of the local party structures by ensuring they are responsible for the organisation of the local election campaign.

A screenshot from Mike Whitehead's website before he was sacked

""However, the Conservative Party at national level has declined to get involved in what it sees as a remote internal squabble out in the shires.

""The total power of single party control without effective opposition is never a good situation as we have seen from recent events elsewhere in Yorkshire.

""I could not in good conscience continue supporting the local Conservative party when they are obsessed with going down the same road.""

As a member of Ukip he would be better able to speak up for residents and represent their views on the council, he added.

He went on: ""I also hope that with the election of other Ukip councillors, I can help open this secretive council up and make it more transparent and work better for the residents rather than to the benefit of the few.""

He said he wanted to ensure the local authority works more closely with other agencies including Hull City Council and Humberside Police.

""It is important that we remove petty fiefdoms and ensure this region is not left behind when greater resources are devolved by the next Government,"" he added.

DENMARK EXTENDS BORDER CONTROLS FOR MIGRANTS Denmark has opted to extended its temporary border controls by 20 days to February 3 to curb the influx of migrants. The government had initially implemented a 10-day control after a similar move by Sweden. 'The assessment is that there is still a risk that a large number of illegal immigrants accumulate in Denmark,' the Integration Ministry said.

Rafi Ibrahim, a Syrian who has lived in Denmark for years, said new migrants don't know how to behave around women in Western society.

He said: 'If they see a girl, they go nuts. They simply can't handle it.

'In Syria and many other countries, it is not normal for a strange woman to smile at you.

'Those girls who are harassed aren't necessarily scantily-dressed or drunk. Sometimes it is enough just to be a girl.'

It comes after more than two hundred women reported being sexually assaulted by groups of mostly Arab or North African men in Cologne during the New Year celebrations.

Police say 553 criminal complaints have been filed, with about 45 per cent involving allegations of sexual offences, and most of the suspects identified so far are foreign nationals.

The attack have been seized by right-wing groups as evidence that chancellor Angela Merkel's open door policy is a failure.

Finland and Sweden later issued warnings to women to be wary of the threat of sex attacks following fresh reports of sexual assaults in the last week,

Viennese police have also advised women not to go outside alone in Vienna.

Further cases have also emerged of similar attacks being reported in Switzerland, where six women claimed to have been victims in Zurich on New Year's Eve.",0.25662374998472326,0.7566237499847233,-0.5,0.0

259738,True,603,"Metrics are an important part of incident response. You should know your average time to detect compromised systems and how successful phishing campaigns are against your users. To start successful metrics, you need to choose a taxonomy to use. In this example, we will be using the VERIS(1) taxonomy. It is well documented and allows you to compare yourself to the DBIR report.

One of the problems with metrics is the amount of time it takes to enter data and correlate it. While it may take less than 5 minutes to determine how many people responded to a phish, it may take up to 20 minutes to create the tickets in your tracking system. To greatly increase your efficiency and accuracy, scripting should be used.

RTIR(2) is an open source ticketing system for incident response based on Request Tracker. This system can be built based on the VERIS taxonomy by creating custom fields that match the categories. This system supports using a REST API(3) to automate the creation of tickets.

We need to create the following custom fields for our use case. Some of these will have static values and others will need to enter as a command line argument.

hacking.discovery_method, hacking.targeted, impact.security_incident, social.variety, social.vector,social.target, confidentiality.data.variety, misuse.variety

Additionally, we want to track other stats that aren't used in VERIS, but are very useful for tracking campaigns.

victim-username,ioc.attacker.ip, ioc.attacker.domain

Now that we have the basic breakdown of what fields we want to enter data in, we need to script it (4). You need to make sure you put in your credentials to the script along with the IP/DNS name of your server. The two main parts that you can adjust to fit any incident type are the arguments and the post_data. The ticket will be created and closed when the script is complete.

To run this script as posted, do the following:

>rt-phishing.py --username bob --ip 127.0.0.1 --domain malware.bad --creator twebb --time 5

While metrics are important, they shouldn't be demanding to create. Anything that your SOC does that doesn't require lots of documentation should be easily scripted.

Parrot is a service that backs up files from a monitored file/directory.

####description

Parrot runs as a systemd user service and also as a dbus service. Parrot's dbus service capabilities offer signals and methods that allow you to remotely set up watches to back up files and/or signal on events.

Parrot is a systemd user service, being so means that the DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS will not be set to the correct bus address (since none of the environment variables are set in a systemd user instance). To circumvent this, Parrot runs an instance of dbus as a systemd service. There are several files under the systemd directory to set this up. The .socket unit activates the systemd socket for the dbus bus address. The matching .service unit executes the dbus session, while the .conf drop in sets the environment variable bus address name.

The screenshot above shows an instance of Parrot on d-feet (a dbus utility program). Once a Parrot watch is set on a directory, anytime a file in that directory is opened Parrot will make a backup of that file before any changes occur. That way if any mistakes are written to that file and saved, there will be a backup of the file before those changes took place.

In addition to backing up files, Parrot functions in helping log when those changes/accesses in the Parrot'd directory occur. By subscribing to Parrot's accessed signal, Parrot will broadcast a signal in the form of seconds since the epoch whenever a file in the watch directory is accessed. This signal can easily be logged in whatever form needed or some other form of action can be take place such as callbacks to extend any additional functionality that might be called for.

255447,False,1024,"Ecosystem protection payments pay off Trees take up a lot of CO 2 , so one approach to reducing the rate of increase in atmospheric CO 2 levels is to reduce the cutting down of trees. Jayachandran et al. evaluated a program in which forest owners in Uganda were paid to not cut down their trees. Encouragingly, payments did reduce deforestation, and owners did not compensate by cutting down trees in neighboring forests. Furthermore, even in a scenario where cutting resumed after payments ceased, the beneficial delay in CO 2 release from cut trees, as quantified by the social cost of carbon, outweighed the monetary cost. Science, this issue p. 267

Abstract We evaluated a program of payments for ecosystem services in Uganda that offered forest-owning households annual payments of 70,000 Ugandan shillings per hectare if they conserved their forest. The program was implemented as a randomized controlled trial in 121 villages, 60 of which received the program for 2 years. The primary outcome was the change in land area covered by trees, measured by classifying high-resolution satellite imagery. We found that tree cover declined by 4.2% during the study period in treatment villages, compared to 9.1% in control villages. We found no evidence that enrollees shifted their deforestation to nearby land. We valued the delayed carbon dioxide emissions and found that this program benefit is 2.4 times as large as the program costs.

Land-use change—mostly deforestation—was responsible for 9% of global anthropogenic carbon emissions between 2006 and 2015, making it the second largest source of carbon emissions after fossil fuel combustion (1). Trees absorb carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) through photosynthesis and store the carbon in their biomass. When a tree is cut down, it stops absorbing CO 2 , and, as it decomposes or is burned, its store of carbon is released into the atmosphere.

Curbing deforestation in low-income countries, where most deforestation occurs today, is viewed as one of the most cost-effective ways to reduce global CO 2 emissions (2, 3). The reasoning is that the cost to intensify agriculture and adopt nonwood fuels and construction material in poor countries to meet growing consumption needs without clearing forests is much lower than the cost of many of the technological changes in high-income countries that reduce emissions by the same amount. Thus, having rich countries finance forest conservation projects in poor countries is a promising way to address climate change.

Indeed, the United Nations' REDD+ (Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation) mechanism was created to financially reward developing countries for preservation of forests. The Paris Agreement negotiated in 2015 bolstered the role of REDD+ in international climate policy (4, 5). To put REDD+ into action, one needs to identify effective on-the-ground interventions that reduce deforestation. This Research Article evaluates a promising and popular type of intervention, namely, financial incentives for forest owners to keep their forest intact. This type of policy is called Payments for Ecosystem Services (PES): Payments are made conditional on voluntary proenvironment behaviors (6–8). PES is the environmental version of conditional cash transfers, a policy instrument used widely in developing countries to incentivize families to invest in child health and education.

Despite the widespread use and growing popularity of PES, its effectiveness and cost-effectiveness are open questions. One key concern is what the PES community calls ""additionality"" and economists refer to as ""inframarginality"": Absent the payments, some participants would have engaged in the incentivized behavior anyway. If such individuals represent many of the enrollees, then the program will generate very little gain in forest cover per dollar spent. A second concern is that individuals will simply shift their tree-cutting from land covered by the PES contract to other nearby land (""leakage"").

This study was a randomized evaluation of a PES intervention that was implemented in order to measure the causal impacts on forest cover. The PES program offered private owners of forest in western Uganda payments if they refrained from clearing trees. The program was designed and implemented by a local conservation nonprofit, Chimpanzee Sanctuary and Wildlife Conservation Trust (CSWCT) (9). The study was carried out in 121 villages with private forest owners (PFOs); we randomly selected 60 of the villages to be in the treatment group. In treatment villages, the PES program was marketed to PFOs, and they were eligible to enroll. To participate, PFOs had to enroll all of their primary forest (10). During the 2-year program from 2011 to 2013, enrollees who complied with the contract received 70,000 Ugandan shillings (UGX), or $28 in 2012 U.S. dollars, per hectare of forest per year, paid out in cash at the end of each year. CSWCT employed forest monitors who conducted spot checks of enrollees' land to check for recent tree-clearing. The program also offered additional payments in exchange",0.7917169768245405,0.7917169768245405,0.0,0.0

Allsop took the original model out of production when vinyl ""died,"" but re-introduced it some years later in a new version that used replaceable cloth cartridges. They were more convenient to swap out than the older system but far more expensive.

At some point despite growing LP sales, Allsop once again stopped producing and selling the Orbitrac. I had been discussing the re-introduction of the Orbitrac with Brent Allsop, even to the point of offering to buy the rights and manufacture it myself, when Mr. Allsop was tragically killed in an automobile accident.

Recently a U.K. based reader sent me the closest thing to an Orbitrac I've yet seen. It's called a ""HyperBRUSH™"" and it's manufactured in Ireland and marketed by TRACKMate™. Though the company lists a U.S. distributor in Vancouver, WA. I could find no contact information and the product doesn't seem to be distributed in America.

The utterly clueless company markets a VHS cleaner and other such products on amazon.com but not the HyperBRUSH record cleaner. However, I did find it on Amazon.UK. for £9 (about $18).

It works similar to the Orbitrac and comes with a record cleaning solution that I didn't try. It also has a stylus cleaning pad that works well and another felt pad atop the cleaner that's not identified for any purpose. In fact the instructions don't identify the stylus cleaning brush and I bet some inexperienced users might use the felt pad instead of the one that's supposed to be used. Of course you won't make that mistake.

The HyperBRUSH doesn't replace a good wet cleaning system whether the inexpensive Spin Clean or a vacuum machine or the Audio Desk ultrasonic machine. However, the HyperBRUSH is very useful as a pre-clean for really dirty records when used with any of the wet machines so you don't gum up and foul the machine brushes.

The HyperBRUSH also includes a static reducing strip. Unfortunately the brushes aren't replaceable. The company says washing them with warm soapy water (followed by a very good rinse) will restore them but I've not yet reached that point with the one I've got here. Plus I have the original Orbitrac and enough replacement pads to last a lifetime (thanks to a barter deal with a reader).

Overall, I found the HyperBRUSH convenient to use on the turntable thanks to the over-the-spindle rotating feature and considering the low price, it's a worthwhile tool in one's record cleaning arsenal.",0.6726381229453297,0.6726381229453297,0.0,0.0

256399,False,1024,"Harness Induced Pathology is a silent killer in High Angle Rope Rescue, it can also be known as Harness hanging syndrome, Suspension Trauma, Suspension Induced Shock, and Etc. Whatever the title may be, it still poses a problem for rescuers and patients. We will be covering the problems associated, sign/symptoms, and recovery of Harness Induced Pathology.

Harness Induced Pathology occurs when a rescuer or victim is suspended in their harnesses for long periods of time. When the harness is under tension around the body it can constrict around the major arteries and blood vessels thorough out the body, thus not allowing the proper blood flow to the heart, brain, and muscle tissues. When the proper blood flow is interrupted it can cause hypoxia to the brain, causing the rescuer/victim to become unconscious, and in some cases even death. Another problem associated with Harness Induced Pathology is the pooling of blood in extremities. When the harness constricts around the body it can act as a tourniquet cutting off the much needed oxygen to vital organs. During normal bodily functions, the legs do not pool larger amounts of blood due to the large amounts of muscle tissue surrounding the arteries, thus allowing the heart to pump normally while the leg muscle provides assistants in allowing the blood the travel ""uphill"". When this process is interrupted by constricting of the harnesses around the legs, the muscle and blood vessels in the legs tend to relax. This can cause the heart to drop in blood pressure when the constriction or tourniquet is released, thus not allowing enough blood to reach the brain. One other problem with pooling blood is septicemia. When blood pools for longs periods of time it can build harmful toxicants. When these toxicants are released, they travel to vital organs causing shock and even cardiac arrest at times. If rescuers understand the sign and symptoms, they can treat and even prevent this from happening to themselves and victims.

Signs and Symptoms

Faintness, nausea, hot flushes, sweats, breathlessness, feeling of panic or uneasy, change in pulse rate (suddenly slowing or becoming rapid), cramping of muscles, and or sudden fatigue

Preventing Harness Induced Pathology:

Rescuers:

Take adequate fluids

Keep warm but avoid excess sweating and heat exhaustion

Recover before a long assents or other vigorous exertion

Do not push yourself to the point of exhaustion

Avoid prolonged stationary suspension in a harness – take turns at the job, consider a boson's chair or alternative belay position.

If it is necessary to hang in your harness, change position as necessary to keep comfortable and try to regularly tense your calves to maintain circulation

Always wear a chest harness so that you can lean back without risk of turning inverted or falling from your harness if consciousness is reduced or lost for any reason

When wearing a class two or three harness, make sure your waist strap is tight, but do not over tighten the thigh and buttocks straps. Leave room for adjustment during rescue of training operations

If you feel at all faint or unwell at any time, let others know, tense your legs repetitively and try to lower your head and raise your legs.

Treating Harness Induced Pathology:

Stabilize the patient as well as possible before a lift

Ensure cold patients are adequately insulated with dry and waterproof clothing or a plastic bag and blankets or hypothermia bag if in a stretcher – do not forget to insulate the head.

Rehydrate if possible – oral water or sports drinks if conscious, IV fluids if medical or paramedic assistance enables this.

If exhausted, provide some easily digestible energy source – glucose sweets etc.

Treat any cold or exhausted person as a patient and ensure they are closely monitored and, if possible, hoisted horizontally in a stretcher rather than allowed to climb or be hoisted in a harness only.

If a horizontal stretcher hoist is not feasible, consider an under knees strap to hold the patient more horizontally.

When vertical hoist is unavoidable, minimize hanging time

Accompany patients during raises and lowers wherever possible

Monitor vital signs

Ask conscious patients to do leg contractions to assist circulation

Get the patient horizontal as soon as possible, consistent with safety for rescuers

If collapse occurs mid hoist and intervention is not possible on the rope, complete hoist or lower patient rapidly – whichever will get the patient to a stable position with at least one rescuer to provide care.

If unable to provide IV therapy from height, wait until to victim is a few feet from the ground, give appropriate fluids and treatment before the patients harness releases tension from the victim's body. Remember, when working from rope always try and reposition ones self to avoid",0.2252758030541414,0.7252758030541414,-0.5,0.0

My initial impressions of GLOW based mostly on the plot synopsis was very positive. The idea of a television show centered on the backstage world of professional wrestling has been shockingly overlooked, given the fact it seems to be more popular than ever, and as a woman who grew up enjoying wrestling this show sits at a near-perfect crossroads of my interests. It's a comedy about professional wrestling, starring a diverse and mostly female cast? I was on board with this from the moment it was greenlit!

For the entirety of the first episode, we hear other characters telling Ruth (Alison Brie) constantly how ""real"" she is, but we never get the opportunity to personally see it and, personally, I don't initially buy it. I don't think Ruth sees it, either. A casting director tells her she's the kind of ""real"" actress movie directors think they're looking for (until they see her and realize they don't), and the man she sleeps with tells her this several times during sex. But whereas these characters seem to think of her as centered or maybe in-tune with herself, all we see is a grown woman borrowing money from her parents for what she claims will be the last time, eating Cinnamon Toast Crunch for every meal, making her instructor fall asleep during line reading class, and sleeping with her best friend's husband. She is clearly passionate about acting, but the biggest thing holding her back from achieving meaningful success is herself.

The name Ruth is kind of fitting for her; she's ruthless, but not in a positive sense. She's driven entirely by desperation and neediness, a desire to be liked and to be validated, and she'll stop at almost nothing for it. Her best friend Debbie (Betty Gilpin), a former actress who happily left the profession to get married and start a family, urges Ruth to rethink her priorities and maybe even follow her own life path. Ruth is just barely able to decline her suggestion with politeness.Instead she goes home and has sex with Debbie's husband.

Right as she appears to be at the end of her rope, Ruth gets a phone call from the casting director she earlier accosted in a bathroom (to ask for feedback on how to be more likeable and therefore land more acting jobs, naturally) telling her about an open casting call for ""unconventional women."" Ruth shows up without any trepidation and learns that the casting is for a new show called GLOW – Gorgeous Ladies of Wrestling. The actresses are the wrestlers. The wrestlers are actresses. Ruth is desperate and continues on, despite the fact that one of the masterminds behind GLOW, Sam (Marc Maron) sees right through Ruth and is unimpressed. Or maybe he doesn't see through her, but he's still unimpressed. It's unclear, but what IS clear is that Ruth is approaching the whole thing with her trademark sense of desperation, and it isn't winning her any favors in Sam's eyes.

Ruth's efforts to be liked and stay liked throughout the episode are so embarrassing to watch that they're almost painful. When Sam cuts Ruth during rehearsals as punishment for trying to add flourish to her performance and improvise a ridiculous backstory that her character is in trouble for stealing a loaf of bread, you're almost glad that the characters in the show hated the whole thing as much as you did. And when she goes home to study professional wrestling and comes back the next day in full costume, reciting a monologue from ""Cat on a Hot Tin Roof"" in the style of Hulk Hogan, you can appreciate what she's going for while also wanting her to stop, immediately. Fortunately her drive to be liked wins her a part on the show, but not because she impresses anyone with her performance or her stage presence.

Instead, her show is cut short by her best friend Debbie, who has learned that Ruth slept with her husband Mark (Rich Sommer, one of Alison Brie's Mad Men co-stars). Debbie is furious and storms the gym to confront Ruth, who is downright resistant to the idea of any real confrontation. As Sam watches Debbie enter the ring and decide the only way she'll feel better is to kick Ruth's ass, he begins to daydream about the two of them as professional Gorgeous Ladies of Wrestling – in full costume, surrounded by screaming fans. It seems like the chemistry between these two women is exactly what he's been looking for, and as Ruth looks at Sam while Debbie pins her to the ring, she can tell she's finally going to get that validation she was after, just not the way she wanted it.

Debbie's entrance is a little bit of a dues ex machina moment, although I've always taken the stance that dues ex machina is a fine device, as long as the payoff is satisfying. And I think that watching Debbie kick Ruth's ass was satisfying for two reasons; one, of course, is that we really",0.5852176682289558,0.7852176682289558,-0.1,-0.1
257754,True,975,"Many men try to achieve the appearance of having a thicker and fuller beard for a variety of reasons. Maybe they have dreams of competing in a men's beard competition, or maybe its purely for the aesthetic reasoning. Either way, it's undeniable that some men do go through issues regarding the growth of their facial hair. The combination of having too early, a less than par skincare routines, and a poor diet can make any man's beard look patchy, or just simply weak.


Since beards are coming back in style and many are associating them with power and masculinity, it's not a shocker to know that a variety of men want to grow a fantastic, thick, beard. There are some generic reasons why some men's beards are thicker than others, and there are a few tips that can help the possibility of your bread becoming thicker.

Before getting into the variety of tips, the first step is to do a mental test of the qualities of your beard. You should separate them into three categories: thickness, length, and liveliness. Though out of all of these three categories, the hardest one to fix is thickness as it is mainly related to your genetics.

How does a beard appear to be thicker?

While some men do have the luxury of being able to grow a thick beard within a couple of weeks, other men seem to be waiting a lifetime to get the desired look. While it may seem as if most men beards grown on different rates – a majority is actually grown in a similar time span.

The three factors that give the appearance of a man having a thicker bear is the colour of the beard (mainly when it appears darker), the overall density, and the length of the beard and hair follicles. While genetics do play a major role in your beard thickness, just making simple changes to your daily routine can help increase the overall health of your beard and finally give you the look that you've been looking for.

1. Adopt a Better Skin Care Routine

While it may not be the most masculine thing to change – its true. Having better and healthier skin will lead to a healthier and thicker beard. Other than making your skin look more pleasant to touch and view, finding a good moisturiser and cleanser can help your beard in more ways than one.

The act of cleansing and moisturising your face on a daily basis (once in the morning and once before bed), will help stimulate circulation throughout your hair follicles, along with exfoliating and getting rid of dead skin cells that could be causing a delayed growth with your beard. On the other hand, moisturising will keep your skin hydrated enough to grow thicker hair without the added itchiness.

2. Pick Up Cardio

Having excess weight can stunt the growth of your bead due to it meaning that you most likely have an unhealthy lifestyle. Exercising is known to help stimulate beard growth and make you feel more confident. However, cardio has been studied to be the best exercise to incorporate.

Some of the most popular cardio workout, such as running, biking, and dancing have been proven to help your beard grow faster as well. This is due to an increase in testosterone – which is needed to promote hair follicles becoming stronger along with growth. It also stimulates blood circulation within the body that has a variety of benefits.

3. Be less Stressed

It's a fact that stress can lead to a variety of issues in your life. Stress has the power to impact your physical appearance by making you look more agitated, and that can have an impact on the appearance and lustre of your beard. To be a bit scientific, stress will affect your cortisol which in turn creates a negative relationship with your body's testosterone creation. Along with creating issues with your blood vessels – stress is just a big negative you need to get rid of.

Both kinds of stress, short-term, and long-term can make your beard grown in patchier or less dense. Although having a bad sleep schedule that is caused stress makes the challenge of growing a beard more of a hassle. While getting rid of stress is a personal issue that must be solved, mediation and stress relieving techniques will help you and your beard our tremendously.

4. Create a Better Diet

Having a diet that is filled with vitamins and good nutrients can help the growth of your beard. This can be created by eating more veggies, fruits, and healthy meats – such as fish and chicken. A few of the recommended foods that you should begin eating weekly are eggs, healthy greens, and a variety of nuts without the added salt or sugar. This simple step will help your beard look more thick along with giving you more energy throughout the day.",0.3583031795485744,0.7583031795485744,-0.4,0.0

Plot Edit

"" is the ninth episode of Season 1 , and overall the ninth produced hour of Hannibal . It originally aired on May 23, 2013.

The BAU team hunts a serial killer who digs up his victims, creating a totem pole of their bodies as a macabre trophy. When Nick Boyle's body is found, Jack & Alana question Abigail about his death. The resurrection of Nick's body enlightens Will to some of Abigail's secrets and Hannibal convinces Will to keep some of his own. Attempting to assert independence, Abigail agrees to write a book with Freddie Lounds and in the process, reveals her biggest secret to Hannibal.

Synopsis Edit

In her psychiatric hospital, Abigail Hobbs irrationally holds herself responsiblefor the murders her father committed; if only Abigail were dead instead of Garret Jacob Hobbs ' victims, the innocents would still be alive.


Meanwhile, in Grafton, West Virginia, the FBI finds a totem pole composed of human corpses on a snow-covered beach. Only one of the bodies is recently killed - the rest were dug up. Jack clears the crime scene and allows Will to dive inside the mind of the killer. Will realizes that whoever did this utilized careful premeditation; they wanted their last, still breathing victim to watch it all before they died. And then, once the totem pole was assembled, the killer stabbed his final victim inthe heart and placed his corpse at the very top.


Will blinks and, in an instant, finds himself sitting in Hannibal 's office. Will has no idea how he got there and begins to panic. Hannibal suggests Will has an empathy disorder; he cares so much about his victims and the crimescommitted against them that his conscious choice to ignore those feelings is negatively affecting his brain. Lecter says Will's life is separating from reality. Will admits he's been sleepwalking and wonders if he should get a CAT scan. But Hannibal knows the truth: Will's job is crushing him, and his decision to put others' lives above his own might end up being the death of Will...


The families of Garrett Jacob Hobbs' victims have filed wrongful death suits against his estate, which means his surviving daughter, Abigail, has nothing to her name. In the hospital, Freddie Lounds comforts Abigail and promises her she'll make money of her own someday. When Abigail wonders if her story could fetch a payday as a book,Freddie jumps on the idea - she can write it for Abigail, but promises it will be ""her story."" Freddie encourages Abigail to keep the deal between them and not involve anyone else, like Will Graham. After a moment of thinking, Abigail agrees to write a book on her life with Freddie's help.


Will visits Jack and apologizes for letting the totem pole crime scene get to him. Jack is worried about Graham, but Will assures him he's over it and ready to move on.


In forensics, Jimmy Price and Beverly Katz explain the bodies came from graves around the crime scene, mostly wrongful deaths, which suggest previous murders. The one on top - the most recent murder - is Joshua Summers a single stab wound to the heart. Will glances at the crime scene photos and knows all 17 dead bodies were murdered. This is about the killer meshing his past with his present.


Will details the facts of the totem pole murders to his class, but when Alana Bloom interrupts, he quickly realizes the whole thing was occurring inside of his head. Will is alone in his darkened classroom, speaking to himself. When Alana enters, Will apologizes for kissing her earlier, but she didn't mind - in fact, she liked it. Alana regrets leaving his house that night, but is currently on the fence about her feelings for Will. She really likes him, but knows they can never have a relationship if he's in his current unstable state. When Alana asks Will if he's unstable, he bashfully nods his head.


At the psychiatric hospital, Will and Hannibal try to dissuade Abigail from writing a tell-all book with Freddie Lounds. If Abigail publishes this book, she'll be putting her privacy - along with Hannibal and Will's privacy - in jeopardy. Abigail just wants the truth to come out, but once the door is open, Abigail will have no control over what people say or write about her. Is she ready for that?

Will's had a revelation about the case; totem poles tell a story, from the top to the bottom. This killer might be tracing his criminal history chronologically. Beverly Katz",0.0,0.7697404014567535,-0.9,0.0

One of the limitations of the current technology is inconsistent performance in long-term applications. Although the brain tissue response is believed to be a major cause of performance degradation, the precise mechanisms that lead to failure of recordings are unknown. We observed persistent ED1 immunoreactivity around implanted silicon microelectrode arrays implanted in adult rat cortex that was accompanied by a significant reduction in nerve fiber density and nerve cell bodies in the tissue immediately surrounding the implanted silicon microelectrode arrays. Persistent ED1 up-regulation and neuronal loss was not observed in microelectrode stab controls indicating that the phenotype did not result from the initial mechanical trauma of electrode implantation, but was associated with the foreign body response. In addition, we found that explanted electrodes were covered with ED1/MAC-1 immunoreactive cells and that the cells released MCP-1 and TNF-alpha under serum-free conditions in vitro. Our findings suggest a potential new mechanism for chronic recording failure that involves neuronal cell loss, which we speculate is caused by chronic inflammation at the microelectrode brain tissue interface.",0.8104654769649879,0.8104654769649879,0.0,0.0

Large Majority of Americans—Including Gun Owners—Support Stronger Gun Safety Policies

Follow-up to survey conducted following Sandy Hook shooting shows support for gun safety policies remains strong

A large majority of Americans – including gun owners – continue to support stronger policies to prevent gun violence than are present in current federal and most state law, according to a new national public opinion survey conducted by researchers with the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Policy and Research at the Bloomberg School of Public Health.

The survey is a follow-up to one conducted by the same researchers in early 2013, shortly after the shooting at the Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut that left 26 dead.

The results are published online in Preventive Medicine.

""Two years after the tragedy in Newtown, our study of public support for two dozen specific gun policies found a large majority of Americans continue to favor a range of gun-safety policies,"" says lead study author Colleen Barry, PhD, MPP, an associate professor at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. ""Support was strongest – with little difference between gun-owners and non-owners – for universal background checks, barring people with temporary restraining orders for domestic violence from having guns and stronger regulations of licensed gun dealers.""

Support for requiring background checks for all gun sales remained high, with 85 percent of gun owners and 83 percent of non-owners favoring the policy. In the 2013 survey, 84 percent of gun owners and 90 percent of non-owners supported background checks for all gun sales. Support for banning assault weapons among all respondents decreased from 69 percent in 2013 to 63 percent in 2015, and support for banning the sale of large capacity ammunition magazines decreased from 68 percent to 60 percent. Notably, the small erosion in support for these policies occurred almost entirely among non-gun-owners.

The 2015 national survey was conducted two years from the date the 2013 survey was fielded, and used the same sampling approach and survey research firm, GfK. The latest survey included 1,326 respondents, while 2013 survey included 2,703 participants.

More than 11,000 people in the United States are killed each year as a result of gun homicides, and the firearm homicide rate in the U.S. is seven times higher than in the average high-income country.

""The extraordinarily high rate of gun violence in the U.S. is due in large part to weaknesses in our standards for legal gun ownership and laws to hold individuals accountable if they put guns into the wrong hands,"" says study author Daniel Webster, ScD, MPH, director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Policy and Research. ""Yet when we poll Americans, we see strong support even among gun owners for stricter standards and increased accountability.""

In the 2015 survey, the majority of gun owners surveyed support prohibiting a person convicted of a serious crime as a juvenile from having a gun for 10 years (73 percent), prohibiting people who have been convicted of public display of gun in a threatening manner excluding self-defense from having a gun for 10 years (75 percent), and prohibiting people convicted of domestic violence from having a gun for 10 years (76 percent).

Similarly, the majority of gun owners (67 percent) also support allowing cities to sue licensed gun dealers when the gun dealer's sales practices allow criminals to obtain guns and requiring a mandatory minimum sentence of two years in prison for a person convicted of knowingly selling a gun to someone who cannot legally have one (71 percent).

""All too often, pollsters ask Americans whether they support more or less gun control, or frame gun policies as controls on gun ownership generally rather than as measures to keep guns from criminals or other high-risk groups,"" Barry says. ""When you drill down to specific policies, you see that Americans are very much in support of common-sense regulations to keep their families and communities safe from gun violence.""

To loud cheers of victory, UCSC director of News and Media Relations Scott Hernandez-Jason stood before hundreds of students at Kerr Hall about 5:30 p.m. Thursday and announced that the university was committed to better serving its African, black and Caribbean-identified students.

To illustrate this, UCSC Chancellor George Blumenthal agreed to the Alliance's demands and made the following commitments:

• UCSC committed to extending up to a four-year housing guarantee to all students from underrepresented communities who applied to and live in the Rosa Parks African American Theme House.

• UCSC committed to converting the first floor lounge area of the Rosa Parks African American Theme House from housing back to a community lounge space.

• USCS committed to painting the exterior of the Rosa Parks African American Theme House in the Pan-Afrikan colors red, gold and green.

• USCS committed to delivering a mandatory ""educational diversity"" orientation to all incoming freshmen and transfer students.

Two hours earlier, an agreement that would end the three-day occupation did not seem likely. About 3:30 p.m., members of the Alliance leadership announced through a bullhorn that Blumenthal had declined to meet at Kerr Hall, citing concerns for his safety.

Instead, Blumenthal sent members of his administration, including campus diversity officer Linda Scholz, to speak with the students at the entrance of Kerr Hall. Surrounded by hundreds of chanting, screaming students, Scholz invited the leadership group of the Alliance to speak with Blumenthal in the nearby Thimann Labs building.

It initially appeared as if the Alliance would decline to speak with Blumenthal and, instead, insist the chancellor meet on their terms. However, the leadership group eventually accompanied the administrators to Thimann Labs.

After more than an hour in conference, the Alliance leadership and Hernandez-Jason returned to Kerr Hall to announce the university's decision and allow the students to celebrate their victory.

Hernandez-Jason said he assumed this agreement meant that Kerr Hall would now be vacated by the students, although he did not appear to have a written agreement from the Alliance.

The protest, which made national news, has not been without its controversies. The Alliance refused to speak to local media, verbally harassing and threatening to press unspecified charges against the Sentinel for covering the occupation. However, it did grant an interview to Tucker Carlson of Fox News.

The Alliance said local media was ""trespassing"" on property they had ""reclaimed.""

In addition, during the rally that preceded the occupation of Kerr Hall on Tuesday at Quarry Plaza, members of the Afrikan Black Student Alliance verbally attacked Jewish students, according to Santa Cruz Hillel Director Sarah Cohen Domont.

""Our students were, on three separate instances, subjected to protesters yelling, (expletives and anti-Semitic insults) and one of our Israeli flags was torn down,"" wrote Cohen Domont in a public statement. ""The ABSA called for protesters to stand in solidarity with their Palestinian brothers and sisters.""

The official mark of the new speed record is 106.966 km/h. The previous one of 73 km/h had stood for 26 years.

The main advantage of eVe is that it is not only an electric car, but uses solar power too. The car uses solar panels on the roof and also has a hood to charge a 60kg battery. However, the panels were switched off during the world-record attempt, leaving the car to run solely on the battery charge. According to the engineers, eVe can cover 800km from a single charge.

The world record was unofficially broken on July 23 at a racetrack in Geelong, Victoria, Australia. However, the record in this field must be officially approved by the International Automobile Federation (FIA), which is the world motorsport's governing body. And, finally, in October the organization issued a new update of the records and approved the Sunswift team's achievement.

Sunswift was founded in 1996 and it's Australia's top solar car racing team. This record is not their first. They have already set a world record for the fastest solar powered road trip from Perth to Sydney, and a Guinness World Record for the fastest solar car.

More than 100 students at the University of New South Wales (UNSW) have contributed to the record attempt over the past two years.

""It's not often you can confidently say you made history before you even graduated,"" Sunswift's project director and undergraduate engineering student Hayden Smith said in a statement.

With an official world record the team can now concentrate on a new challenge, which is to modify their car to meet road registration requirements. Smith said the car could be registered and appear on city streets within a year. The team is sure the car is ready for everyday use.

""Five hundred kilometers is pretty much as far as a normal person would want to drive in a single day,"" Smith said. ""It's another demonstration that one day you could be driving our car.""

""We've always wanted to keep pushing the cultural change towards electric vehicles, and this is another big step in that direction,"" he added. ""This record was about establishing a whole new level of single-charge travel for high-speed electric vehicles, which we hope will revolutionize the electric car industry.""

UNSW officials also expressed their feeling concerning the record.

UNSW Engineering Dean Professor Graham Davies said that for a student project to achieve a new world record for electric vehicle speed and endurance ""is truly remarkable.""

Although he was not well known to the public, Raymond Cattell (1905–1998) was one of the most influential research psychologists of the 20th century. He wrote 56 books and more than 500 journal articles in the fields of personality, intelligence, and multivariate analysis. He designed 30 standardized tests for measuring intelligence and personality, some of which are still in use.

During the course of this remarkably productive career, Cattell received many honors and awards, and in 1997, the American Psychological Association (APA) announced it would present him with the association's Gold Medal Award for Life Achievement. The 92-year-old Cattell traveled to Chicago from Hawaii, where he lived in retirement, to receive the honor, but two days before the ceremony the APA announced that the award was to be ""postponed.""

The reason? Two professional ""racism""-hunters — Barry Mehler of Ferris State University and Abraham Foxman of the ADL — had written the association complaining about Cattell's political views. The APA announced it would withhold the award until a Blue Ribbon Panel had looked into ""the relationship between Dr. Cattell's scientific work and his views on racial segregation."" This caused a furor, in the midst of which Cattell withdrew his name from consideration. The panel disbanded and issued no report; a few months later, Cattell died.

The Cattell Controversy is a book-length account of Cattell's career, with special emphasis on his little-known political writings that so exercised the anti-""racists."" The author, William Tucker of Rutgers University-Camden, is himself a professional anti-""racist,"" who supported the witch hunt, and who assures us that Cattell's views were so appalling that the APA would have disgraced itself by giving him its top honor. Instead, it is University of Illinois Press that has disgraced itself by publishing a volume of transparent dishonesty.

A remarkable scientist

Despite his obvious hatred for Cattell, Prof. Tucker admits that ""almost everyone who had worked with him, even for a short time, regarded Cattell with a mixture of awe and gratitude for his brilliance, his prodigious work ethic, and his ability to inspire others."" Prof. Tucker also concedes that Cattell was admired for ""his good manners, sense of humor, and ability to treat everyone with respect, no matter their status or background,"" but warns us that even Nazi exterminators could be loving husbands and fathers, and that ""it is hardly unusual to find considerable personal charm and kindness coupled with monstrous beliefs.""

Prof. Tucker also recognizes that Cattell was brilliant. He graduated at age 19 from London University with top honors in chemistry and physics. His interests changed, however, after attending a lecture by Cyril Burt on Sir Francis Galton, the father of eugenics. As a boy, Cattell had been deeply moved by the colossal massacre of the First World War and the poverty of London slums, and came to the early belief that such horrors could be alleviated by eugenics. He came of age at a time of great enthusiasm for the view that by understanding and controlling evolution mankind could enter a golden age. Cattell therefore abandoned the physical sciences for the social sciences which, he believed, would be at the forefront in guiding evolution in fruitful directions.

Cattell threw himself into the study of personality because he understood that evolution works on all aspects of personality, not just intelligence, and that any scientific eugenics program would have to make careful choices about which traits to encourage and which to discourage. His Sixteen Personality Factor Questionnaire was first published in 1950 and quickly became a standard instrument for assessing personality. What are now known as ""the big five"" personality traits — openness to experience, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness, neuroticism — though not developed specifically by him, are derived from his work.

Cattell also made important contributions in the study of intelligence. He recognized the need to measure innate ability independent of cultural influence, and his Culture Fair Intelligence Scales are still used today.

Cattell believed that if the traits and abilities of people could be measured at an early age, each citizen could be given the place in society in which he would be happiest and most productive, and that this would put an end to unearned privilege and class conflict. As the great British psychologist Charles Spearman put it, ""perfect justice is about to combine with maximum efficiency.""

Personality assessment had other uses. Cattell believed it could chart the progress of mental therapy, with patients taking periodic tests to see if they were becoming more normal. He also thought that if someone showed the qualities of a great research scientist, for example, he should be given considerable laboratory resources even before he had produced anything important. He believed it was possible to measure groups on",0.5097273806000457,0.8097273806000458,-0.30000000000000004,0.0

OTTAWA — The federal government has acknowledged that it deliberately excluded data indicating a 20% increase in annual pollution from Canada's oilsands industry in 2009 from a recent 567-page report on climate change that it was required to submit to the United Nations.

The numbers, uncovered by Postmedia News, were left out of the report, a national inventory on Canada's greenhouse gas pollution. It revealed a 6% drop in annual emissions for the entire economy from 2008 to 2009, but does not directly show the extent of pollution from the oilsands production, which is greater than the greenhouse gas emissions of all the cars driven on Canadian roads.

The data also indicated that emissions per barrel of oil produced by the sector is increasing, despite claims made by the industry in an advertising campaign.

""The oilsands remain Canada's fastest-growing source of greenhouse gas pollution, and they're the subject of a huge amount of attention and scrutiny in Canada and internationally,"" said Clare Demerse, director of climate change at the Pembina Institute, an Alberta-based environmental research group. ""So it's very disappointing to see Environment Canada publish a 500-page report that leaves out these critical numbers — especially when last year's edition included them.""

Overall, Environment Canada said that the oilsands industry was responsible for about 6.5% of Canada's annual greenhouse gas emissions in 2009, up from 5% in 2008. This also indicates a growth in emissions that is close to about 300% since 1990, which cancel out many reductions in pollution from other economic sectors.

The report attributes the 6% decrease in Canada's overall emissions to the economic slowdown, but it also credits efforts by the Ontario government to reduce production of coal-fired electricity as a significant factor.

Environment Canada provided the oilsands numbers in response to questions from Postmedia News about why it had omitted the information from its report after publishing more detailed data in previous years. A department spokesman explained that ""some"" of the information was still available in the latest report, which still meets Canada's reporting obligations under the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change.

""The information is presented in this way to be consistent with UNFCCC reporting requirements, which are divided into broad, international sectors,"" wrote Mark Johnson in an email.

He was not immediately able to answer questions about who made the decision in government to exclude the numbers from the oilsands or provide a detailed explanation about changes in emissions.

An industry spokesman said it favoured more transparency from the government, suggesting that some of the figures may be misleading because of changes in methods used to identify and calculate emissions.

""It's just too bad you weren't able to get a hold of (Environment Canada) on this one, because here I am telling you my understanding of what's going on, but really it's best to hear directly from them,"" said Greg Stringham, vice-president of oilsands and markets at the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers. ""We report the information to them, and they choose to pass it on — they must pass it on the UN. But then they choose how to disclose it and put it out there.""

Although Stringham said that the industry figures did not show any significant growth in emissions per barrel of oil produced, the full report noted an intensity increase of 14.5% from 2008 to 2009, ""mainly the result of a new integrated mining and upgrading facility as well as a new integrated in-situ bitumen extraction and upgrading facility,"" that were not operating at ""peak efficiencies.""

Emissions from a mining category, which includes oilsands extraction, saw a 371% increase in greenhouse gas pollution, according to the report. But other categories showed significant decreases due, in part, to the recession, but also because of changes in use of fuel and manufacturing operations.

Environment Canada's report recognizes that climate change is occurring, mainly due to an increase in heat-trapping gases in the atmosphere. The objective of the UNFCCC is to stabilize these emissions in order to prevent dangerous changes to the climate.

Critics have suggested the Harper government is deliberately trying to delay international action to fight climate change, following revelations, reported last fall by Postmedia News, that it had set up a partnership with the Alberta government, industry and several federal departments to fight pollution-reduction policies from other countries that target the oilsands through lobbying and public relations.

Environment Minister Peter Kent has said the federal government is committed to reducing Canada's greenhouse gas emissions and will introduce its plan to regulate pollution from the oilsands within months. But he has also acknowledged that existing federal and provincial policies would still result in an increase in emissions over the next decade.

Although the report was due in April, during the last election campaign, Canada was the last country to file its submission. Environment Canada even filed its submission after earthquake-stricken Japan, and was unable to explain in detail why its report was late.",0.7711290182072695,0.7711290182072695,0.0,0.0
259460,False,1024,"So you think you're a badass, crowing about Michael Flynn's resignation and making fun of Trump? You think you're a rebel, spelling his name tRump like a naughty eight year old kid from the forties? It's because ""rump"" means ""butt"", right? Is that the gag? Be careful you don't cut yourself on all that edge there, Lenny Bruce.

I don't expect this article to share particularly well. Progressives are still too intimidated by their liberal friends and acquaintances to openly defy the infamous echo chamber on the social media outlets I get most of my exposure on, but this is getting intensely stupid and somebody needs to say something. The way people are championing a cause that's also being championed by every multimillionaire on every channel on every show on every television as though they're being in some way rebellious and counter-cultural is beyond my understanding. The resignation of a National Security Advisor (a registered Democrat, by the way) who was working against the oligarchic push toward a military confrontation with a nuclear superpower, who was one of the few people telling the truth about America's arming of terrorists in Syria, and Democrats are singing and dancing like a bunch of Ewoks watching an exploding imperial death star.

Let me remind you gangstas that a 2014 Princeton University study showed clearly that the United States of America is an oligarchy, not a democracy. Here's a five-minute video breaking down what that means and how it works in clear and simple terms. Basically, in the current system, your wishes have essentially no impact on your country's legislation and policy unless you are very rich; your vote and the votes of the rest of the 99 percent change functionally nothing about the way your nation moves and behaves. So the fact that this guy was democratically elected to be the leader of the nation doesn't mean that he's actually in charge; ultimately, the real source of power is the large network of oligarchs and unelected manipulators collectively known as the Deep State.

That is what Bernie Sanders kept talking about when he spoke of America becoming an oligarchy, and that is where the real rebellion is. It is also the source of all of the current administration's internal struggles right now.

And this does indeed seem to be the major source of confusion and/or manipulation on America's political left. Clintonian liberals were having a hard time being branded as proponents of the political establishment; they were the squares, the obedient, color-inside-the-lines brown nosers of the rich and powerful. Remember those 'Bernie vs. Hillary' memes? That.

But then when Trump won, they took this as a sign that they get to be the cool kids now, because ""Look! Now he's in charge! That makes him the establishment, right?""

Wrong. The Deep State goes very deep, and the power structures entrenched therein are very old. The POTUS faces a long, hard, uphill slugfest of a battle in his attempts to restructure America's power systems, and the majority in both parties openly or secretly hate him and his stated agendas. It's still far too early to tell if Trump's new power dynamics will be more beneficial for America than the old ones, but he is clearly in conflict with the neoliberal power structures that have been choking America to death for generations.

It's not a coincidence that it was the Washington Post who originally broke the story of Flynn's phone call to Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak in one of its notorious reports from ""anonymous sources"" in the intelligence community, for example. WaPo is owned by Jeff Bezos, who as the fifth-wealthiest person on the planet makes Donald Trump look like a high school janitor, and who has personally received hundreds of millions of dollars directly from the CIA. WaPo has consistently been a devout mouthpiece for the political establishment, running sixteen smear pieces in sixteen hours against Bernie Sanders at the most heated and contentious period in the Democratic primaries, and running fake story after fake story fanning the flames of public hostility toward Russia. This is the Deep State at work, my liberal brothers and sisters, and it's working against Trump, not your buddies in the Democratic party.

This is not a defense of Trump; I see Trump as largely irrelevant and very low on the list of priorities America's political left should be focusing on. This is simply a reminder to liberal Americans that you cannot attack Trump without propping up the Democratic establishment, and you cannot prop up the Democratic establishment without supporting the oligarchs who own it. When you celebrate the Deep State's counteroffensives against the Trump administration, you are not cool, you are not anti-establishment, and you are not a rebel. You are a tool.

Happy Valentine's Day.

The Carolina Panthers announced Saturday that they have exercised LB Luke Kuechly fifth-year option in the coming months.

———

To no surprise, Panthers GM Dave Gettleman told reporters on Tuesday that they will exercise LB Luke Kuechly fifth-year option in the coming months.

""I'd have to be brain-dead not to,"" Gettleman said, per Joe Person.

Because Kuechly was a top-10 pick back in 2012, his fifth-year option will be based on transition tender for his position, which would be the average salary for the top-10 inside linebackers last year.

It's worth mentioning that this tender is guaranteed for injury only, and won't prevent them from working out a long-term contract extension in the coming months.

Kuechly, 23, already has a Defensive Player of the Year award and is clearly in the discussion for being the best inside linebacker in the league.

Kuechly is entering the final year of his four-year, $12.58 million rookie contract and stands to make a base salary of $2,105,265 for the 2015 season.

In 2014, Kuechly recorded 153 tackles, three sacks, one interception, a forced fumble, a recovery and 11 pass defenses for the Panthers. Pro Football Focus has him rated as the N0. 1 inside linebacker out of 60 qualifying players.",0.45807253320242114,0.6580725332024211,-0.1,-0.1

The €100bn project will focus on bandwidth, security and response times, minister for transport and digital infrastructure Alexander Dobrindt said.

Developments including virtual reality and the internet of things will bring enormous data growth, and the need for more bandwidth, reliable real-time transmission and intelligent networks, Dobrindt said.

The network will use ""the most advanced technologies, such as fibre and the future 5G mobile communications standard"", he said.

The Ministry for Transport and Digital services already invests around €4bn a year to bring broadband to under-served regions. From 2018 onwards, the department will invest a further €3bn a year, Dobrindt said.

Netzallianz Digitales Deutschland was founded in March 2014 and brings together most of Germany's major telecommunications firms. 75.5 per cent of households now have fast internet speeds of at least 50 Megabits per second, an increase of 26 per cent since the alliance was established, he said.

Germany's education department announced in October 2016 that it plans to invest €5bn over the next five years to provide faster internet connections, Wi-Fi and tablet computers to schools and colleges.

The government will make the money available to the country's federal states, which are responsible for education, said education minister Johanna Wanka.

256657,True,577,"If your yard is so badly flooded that quacking ducks are paddling gleefully under the clothesline, it's time to make some choices and get things under control. You can adopt the ducks and plant water lilies and a rice paddy, or you can remove the water. With nothing on hand but a garden hose, you may think you're up a proverbial creek without any oars. Not so -- that hose is worth its weight in gold as a siphon. Contrary to what you may have heard, you're not going to have to suck on the end of the hose to work a small miracle.

1 Locate a receptacle -- a spot to deposit the unwanted water where it won't hurt anything else -- such as a street drain or a nearby ditch or culvert.

2 Gather the hose into a loose coil. Drop one end of it into the middle of the flooded area.

3 Take a step or two toward the receptacle and submerge the rest of the coiled hose completely. Hold it under the water until you don't see bubbles coming to the surface from either end, which indicates the hose is full of water. It now contains powerful suction action that's just waiting for a place to happen.

4 Cover the hose end closest to you tightly with your palm to create a seal. This prevents water from leaking out of the hose and ruining the suction built up within it.

5 Hold the hose end as low to the ground as you can and drag it toward the receptacle. Keep checking backward to make sure the flood end of the hose remains under water or your siphon won't work.

6 Squat down at the receptacle. Lower the hose end as close to the ground as you can and point it at the receptacle. Remove your hand from the end of the hose. Water will gush out right away and will continue draining until the flood end is no longer submerged.

7 Move the garden hose around to any other flooded areas of your yard and repeat as needed.

Warning Pick up a middle section of the hose and keep it elevated while the water is running if the receptacle is at a higher ground level than the flood is. Once the siphoning process begins, the water molecules will continue to ""stick"" to each other and drag themselves out of the hose -- even uphill.

259847,True,767,"Four days around the New Jersey Devils and I'm convinced: This is really a team more people should be rooting for.

They're personable. They play hard. They also have a relatively exciting style that relies on a hard, two-man forecheck and creating turnovers that turn into offence.

They don't, by the way, block many shots.

They have game breakers (Zach Parise and Ilya Kovalchuk) and likeable pluggers (David Clarkson, Bryce Salvador, among others) and, of course, a 40-year-old legend in Martin Brodeur who is somehow looking spry again.

They even have a coach, in Peter DeBoer, who is a great success story after grinding out years and years in the OHL in relative anonymity.

(Asked about the penalty box getting stuck shut on Wednesday night at Madison Square Garden, preventing Travis Zajac from going in, DeBoer said, simply: ""Yeah, I have [seen that before] I coached junior for 15 years. I've seen just about everything.""

The Devils are also an underdog, as a sixth seed, and still finding ways to dominate teams like the Philadelphia Flyers through hard work and win games.

""We started every series on the road,"" Brodeur said after the Devils beat the New York Rangers to tie their series in Game 2. ""If we don't win on the road, we're in trouble.""

So why do I get the sense of either (a) apathy or (b) genuine dislike for this team?

Probably because of the jersey they wear.

Let's face it, the Devils may have been the least popular team in this country over the decade between when they won their first Stanley Cup (1995) and their last (2003), as they became the face of the neutral zone trap and the Dead Puck Era.

(What many overlook is how high scoring some of those New Jersey teams really were. They had the second most goals in the league in 1998-99 and 1999-00 and then led the league a year later.)

Stylistically, they've changed considerably under DeBoer, but perceptions for franchises are often very hard to shake.

To many, the Devils are still this no-nonsense, Scott Stevens led defensive squad that celebrated its three Cup wins in the parking lot -- even though they're now full of personality, led by Parise (who talked at length after Game 2 about how DeBoer pushes them to be aggressive in the offensive zone) and have a beautiful new rink that has a read-and-black pavilion out front to potentially parade around in.

Yes, this is another team with financial issues, with the new building not drawing as many fans as they'd like.

Yes, they're low on Canadian content, with Clarkson and Salvador two of only five skaters from this country.

And, yes, GM Lou Lamoriello has a reputation for being crusty even if, like his team, that perception isn't reality. (Few hockey execs are more reasonable to deal with or beloved by their fan base.)

But there's a good argument to be made that, if this roster was dressed up like the Buffalo Sabres or Chicago Blackhawks or Los Angeles Kings (who seem to be this year's darlings), their bandwagon would be filling up right now.

Give this Devils team a chance, get to know some of their players like Patrik Elias, Adam Henrique and Dainius Zubrus and watch their games while they're still in the playoffs.

They'll likely surprise you.

Our Mission Statement

Changing opinions based in ""no"" to opinions based in ""know.""

Overview

No-2-Know believes there is a need in the world to change peoples' perspectives on homelessness; specifically, the need exists to raise awareness as to how and why people become homeless and what plans society can implement to change an individual's homeless status once it occurs. There is a solution: Permanent Supportive Housing, which removes the homeless person from the street, gives that person a home of his or her own, and simultaneously provides services that lead to a permanent solution of one's homelessness. To do this, No2Know believes that people need to change their opinions based in ""no"" to opinions based in ""know:"" Knowing how people become homeless, knowing how to end an individual's homelessness, and most importantly, knowing why to help.


Who We Are...

256296,False,1024,"Extreme Competition Controls CDS

Usually, reviews about sim racing controllers cover controllers that can be bought new and are being produced at the time of writing of the review. Not this review. This review covers a controller that hasn't been produced for about six years now. One that has only been sold new in 1995 and 1996. A controller that, after being used or having gathered dust for six years, is still miles ahead of almost anything you can buy new today. The controller that opened up the market for high end sim racing equipment. This review is about a sim racing controller that just doesn't wear, and that you will occasionally be able to buy through Ebay or sim racing discussion forums. I'm going to talk about Extreme Competition Controls' (ECCI) first controller, the Competition Driving System (CDS).

I bought an ECCI CDS4000 myself in 1999, and ever since that day I'm trying to convince friends of mine to get on the high quality controller path as well. When I noticed a used ECCI CDS for sale last year, it didn't take long before I had convinced my friend Wouter van Geffen that he really should buy that wheel. To my utter surprise and joy, he did! My evil plan had succeeded: finally I could put this wheel to the test, and he seemed to be pretty happy with it as well. So, let's take a look at this six-year-old controller…

THE WHEEL UNIT - OUTSIDE

The housing of the wheel is an almost round cylinder, made of a stainless steel construction. It's pretty large, but 'cute' at the same time and it just breaths quality all over. The 28 cm (11 inch for you weird measuring folks) wheel itself is covered with black suede leather and hand-stitched with a red wire. An instant ""I need to touch this NOW"" sensation overwhelmed me when I first saw the wheel on my friend's desk. The wheel unit just looks terrific, and like Steve Smith once wrote in his Indycar Racing II Strategy Guide: it should be part of the New York Museum of Modern Art permanent collection.

The unit is not equipped with shifter paddles or a shifter stick. Instead, the wheel sports four buttons facing the driver. These buttons function as ordinary joystick buttons and can be used as such. Usually you will use them for shifting and looking left and right, but of course you can assign them to any function, if supported by the sim.

The unit is weighing in at a massive 16 pounds and doesn't need a clamping mechanism to stay put. Therefore, it doesn't have one, which makes it very easy to put the wheel aside when you need your pc for other things than controlling your virtual race car. As if you would ever want to put this controller aside… what a ridiculous thought!

The wheel unit rests on two 'feet': one at the front, one at the back. The height of the foot at the back can be adjusted. This enables you to change the wheel angle, increasing steering comfort for different seating positions.

THE WHEEL UNIT - INSIDE

The beauty of this controller doesn't end on the outside: the outside is just a starting point. When opening up the unit and revealing the inside, it's getting even more impressive. A massive shaft is connected to the steering wheel on one side, and to a rubber tube (which is connected to the high-quality Clarostat potentiometer) on the other side. This is not your usual plastic crap: it's a 0.75"" massive stainless steel shaft. This thing won't break, nor will it bend. A block of ball barings ensures the steering will stay smooth longer than most of us will live. Just about everything in this controller is made of steel or aluminium. The construction is way overdone and doesn't look like it could ever break or fall apart.

The steering unit contains two springs: one is wound up when steering to the left, the other is wound up when steering to the right. These springs are sure not to break either: they're very thick, and winding them up instead of stretching them (what's done on most other controllers) is much better for the lifespan of the spring and guarantees it will never start producing annoying creaking sounds.

More beauty lies in the way the springs are used. The springs are not wound up in a linear way. The thing driving the springs is ECCI's copyrighted cam system. This is a plate, of which the curved edges wind up the springs when turning the wheel. Through this system, ECCI has been able to finetune the steering characteristics of the unit. The result is that the increase of counter pressure you experience is not linear to the increase of the turning ratio of the wheel.

How 'Nightline' Got Inside Apple's Chinese Factories

Given the legendary secrecy of the world's most valuable company, you have to wonder: How am I seeing this? Well, a few years ago, I sent THIS to Steve Jobs, blatantly stealing the Apple beat from a more able colleague. I still feel guilty, but I don't regret it because I was genuinely taken with the second coming of Jobs and was unabashedly fond of Apple's products. My hope for a sweeping profile led to my covering a few launches and every six months we pitched them an ABC News special on the inner workings of Apple. They always politely declined.

But in recent months, the fond memorials for Steve Jobs and the company's record-breaking profits have been tarnished by some of the worst press in Apple's history, most of it related to its top Chinese supplier, Foxconn.

Just after a horrific rash of worker suicides at the Foxconn factory complex outside of Hong Kong in 2010, a monologist named Mike Daisey launched a one-man show called ""The Agony and The Ecstasy of Steve Jobs."" He described travelling to the gates of Foxconn and meeting people coming off 13-15 hour shifts on the Apple lines. He described a 13-year-old who spent her days cleaning iPhone screens.

PHOTOS: Inside Apple's Factories in China

Daisey's show was featured on NPR's ""This American Life"" in January and a listener named Mark Shields was so moved, he launched a petition drive online. Over 250,000 Apple users called on the company to build the first ""ethical"" iPhone, and protests were planned at Apple stores around the world.

It was around this time when Apple called me. They wondered if ""Nightline"" was interested in seeing their iPhone, iPad and MacBook final assembly lines at Foxconn during a first-ever audit by the Fair Labor Association. I said yes, very much, and immediately started imaging the reasons why they were offering such a scoop to me, of all people. Among the possibilities:

-I've said nice things about their products on the air.

-ABC News is owned by the Disney Corporation and Disney CEO Bob Iger serves on the Apple Board of Directors

-The Steve Jobs Trust is Disney's largest shareholder.

-They enjoy ""Nightline.""

It must be the last one, because the first three would have no bearing on my reporting and I'm pretty sure Apple knows it.

'I Think About Resting'

Apple promised complete access, no dog-and-pony, no Potemkin Village, but they denied my repeated requests to interview Apple CEO Tim Cook or the senior vice president of industrial design, Jony Ive.

In a three-golf-cart convoy, both Apple and Foxconn reps took us around to a half dozen production lines in Shenzhen and Chengdu, and there were always five to six people with us as we toured the factories and dorms. But aside from suggesting a visit to the counseling center or canteen, they never steered us to interviews and never interrupted.

For decades, Gillian Findlay has been one of the CBC's more trusted reporters. And last night, the BCIT grad's fifth estate investigation of Jian Ghomeshi's downfall marked a first step in the public broadcaster's effort to rehabilitate its reputation after the worst scandal in its 78-year history.

The show chronicled Ghomeshi's meteoric rise within the corporation and zeroed in on the role that the head of radio, Chris Boyce, had played in the delay in firing him as the host of Q.

The fifth estate's examination left viewers with the impression that management made no serious effort to seek feedback from Q employees after allegations surfaced of him beating and choking women.

This is despite CBC issuing a memo in late October claiming that it had conducted interviews with employees and management. This supposedly occurred after a reporter had asked a Q employee if Ghomeshi's ""behaviour may have 'crossed over' into the workplace"".

The fifth estate proved this with an extensive survey of Q employees in which none reported that they had been contacted.

In addition, Findlay revealed that the CBC management made no effort to reach freelance reporter Jesse Brown, whose research led to a lengthy Toronto Star investigation into Ghomeshi's behaviour.

It was pretty damning stuff.

In the meantime, the fifth estate still has a way to go before it can claim that its probe of the Ghomeshi affair is complete.

For example, I've wondered when Boyce and Chuck Thompson, CBC's head of public affairs, notified executive vice president Heather Conway and president and CEO Hubert Lacroix about the Toronto Star probe.

Were Conway and Lacroix informed of the Canada Day meeting, which managers attended after learning of allegations that Ghomeshi had punched and choked women?

That was still unclear after last night's broadcast. Conway, who oversees English-language services, told CBC chief correspondent Peter Mansbridge earlier this month that people who work at the corporation ""absolutely would not ignore a suggestion that he was punching women"".

Findlay didn't interview Conway for this documentary to respond to Boyce's comments or to discover precisely when she was told about this aspect of the story.

There are other unanswered questions, such as:

• How much was Ghomeshi being paid by the CBC before he was fired?

• Were any CBC executives or Ghomeshi receiving bonuses linked to the syndication of Q in U.S. markets?

• If bonuses were being paid, why hasn't CBC come clean about this more than a month after Ghomeshi was fired? CBC is not required to publish salaries and bonuses of its broadcasters and executives, so the public may never know the answer to that question.

• How much did Ghomeshi bill the corporation in expenses during his tenure as the host of Q? Were they in line with what others at his level were billing?

• Why do CBC executives only allow themselves to be interviewed by CBC journalists about the Ghomeshi affair?

• Why has no one at other media outlets been able to ask CBC president and CEO Hubert Lacroix when he became aware of allegations concerning Ghomeshi's conduct with women?

• Why did the Toronto Star wait until after Ghomeshi was fired to publish the findings of Brown's investigation?

• Why did CBC Radio allow Ghomeshi to veto coverage of Canadian arts and culture in favour of so many interviews with U.S. and British celebrities and foreign journalists when CBC's mandate is to promote Canadian culture?

• Why has CBC Radio under Boyce's leadership become so much more entertainment-focused and less news-focused? Perhaps it's all about ratings, even though the radio service isn't yet selling advertisements. According to a 2011 CBC news release, Boyce ""has been instrumental in the development"" of Q, Randy Bachman's music show Vinyl Tap, and Terry O'Reilly's advertising show Age of Persuasion, as well as the tech-oriented Spark and the medical program White Coat, Black Art.

• Why has CBC chosen to emulate CNN and other U.S. networks by turning its broadcasters into celebrities? It's not only the case with Ghomeshi, but also with Amanda Lang, Rex Murphy, Evan Solomon, and various correspondents on The National, whose faces constantly appear throughout their news stories.

• What role did the former head of English-language services, Richard Stursberg, play in the rise of Ghomeshi's career at the CBC before Stursberg was fired in 2010?

• How was Ghomeshi able to become an entertainment correspondent on The National and the host of Canada Reads, putting him in a position to undermine the brand of these important CBC franchises?

• How much effort has CBC management made in incorporating psychological research into its hiring practices?

256791,True,560,"Quebec Premier Philippe Couillard is being criticized for not speaking French in a speech at a recent conference in Iceland.

But Mr. Couillard snapped back that those taunting him should go to London or New York and see how far speaking French gets them.

There are times, especially on the international scene, when speaking English is required to be understood, he said. That's especially important when one is pitching a plan on the economic development of Quebec.

In the case of the Arctic Circle Assembly in Reykjavik, Iceland last week, where Mr. Couillard spoke in English only, no simultaneous translation was available.

The former prime minister of France delivered his remarks in English as did the president of Iceland and a Norwegian minister, Mr. Couillard noted.

""With all due respect, I think my colleague is exaggerating,"" Mr. Couillard told the National Assembly in response to a question from Coalition Avenir Québec leader François Legault, who was on the attack, saying the premier ""failed to live up to his responsibilities as a representative of the Quebec nation.""

""There are two angles when it comes to language: expression and comprehension. Here's a little challenge for him; go to the London and New York financial circles and pitch your remarkable economic plan … in French only.

""Let's see how that goes.""

It was Mr. Legault's second blast at Mr. Couillard on the subject. The first was Saturday at a CAQ policy convention.

Wednesday, Mr. Legault went at it again, saying in Question Period that it's the duty of every politician in the legislature to promote French in their official functions.

He said Mr. Couillard's initial explanation that everyone in the world already knows Quebecers speak French is not good enough and shows Mr. Couillard is ""naive or, worse, oblivious to his responsibilities to the Quebec nation.""

He called on Mr. Couillard to recognize his mistake and promise not to do it again.

But Mr. Couillard countered by saying he hopes Mr. Legault does not consider himself somehow ""superior"" in the business of defending French.

He said what Mr. Legault is neglecting to mention is that when Mr. Couillard was in China, he delivered all his speeches in French because translation was available and that numerous former premiers, including Parti Québécois ones, stuck to English on certain occasions.

""I submit the following hypothesis,"" Mr. Couillard said,""when we make important remarks, especially those involving the economic development of Quebec, it's usually a good thing to make sure everyone understands what we are saying.""

This is the dramatic moment an illegal Muslim prayer hall was blown up after cops allegedly discovered a stash of explosives inside it.

The building was captured on video being destroyed in a controlled blast by bomb disposal experts near the Russian city of Samara.

It came after cops reportedly found two pounds of explosives - and more than 50 young men, including at least one ' ISIS supporter' - inside the unassuming property.

Footage of the explosion shows a massive part of the prayer hall going up in flames, sending plumes of smoke and debris flying into the air.

Experts decided to blow up the building using jets from a water cannon after deeming the explosives too dangerous to remove, RT.com reports.

Earlier, Russia's special forces had stormed the prayer hall, leading to the detention of 53 men and the alleged discovery of the explosive substances.

256264,True,453,"Israel's defense minister said Tuesday that the country had interpreted Iran's conversion of some enriched uranium to fuel rods for civilian use as evidence that Iran had delayed ambitions to build a nuclear weapon.

The assertion, by Defense Minister Ehud Barak in an interview with The Daily Telegraph, a British newspaper, amounted to the first explanation from him as to why he and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu softened their position in September over the possibility of a military strike to thwart what they called Iran's drive toward imminent nuclear weapons capability.

Their tough position on Iran, which they consider Israel's most dangerous enemy, had generated tensions with the Obama administration, which has contended that Iran is many months away from the ability to make a nuclear weapon.

Mr. Barak, who was visiting London, was quoted by the newspaper as saying an immediate crisis had been averted this summer because Iran had chosen to use a third of its enriched uranium for use as fuel rods in a medical research reactor. The conversion of that uranium, which was reported by the International Atomic Energy Agency in August, makes it much more difficult to use militarily.

The Iranian decision, Mr. Barak said, ""allows contemplating delaying the moment of truth by 8 to 10 months.""

The state's IT team claimed that a DHS IP address repeatedly scanned Indiana's system. The attempted hacks occurred tens of thousands of times over a period of 46 days, beginning while Vice President Mike Pence was still the governor of Indiana.

""We know that between November 1 and December 16, we were scanned with about 14,800 scans, nearly 15,000 different times,"" DHS Indiana Secretary of State Connie Lawson told The Daily Caller.

Like Georgia, Indiana did not give DHS permission to scan.

Thomas Vessely, IT director for the Indiana secretary of state, told TheDCNF that ""we kindly declined [DHS] assistance because we were very comfortable in the work we were doing in monitoring our election system.""

So why did DHS allegedly go for it anyway?

Lawson said she ""always assumed it was because I was the incoming President of the National Association of Secretaries of State and because we declined their assistance.""

Georgia also declined ""help"" from DHS regarding its election system. Georgia Secretary of State Brian Kemp believes DHS may have been trying to intimidate him with the scans before he publicly opposed election systems being labeled as ""critical infrastructure"" by the Obama administration.

As for what was breached by the alleged DHS ""hacking attempts"" in Indiana, Lawson said, ""Our voter registration system was not penetrated."" There was, however, ""one slight penetration on an (election) website that was actually old and out of date, so it didn't go anywhere.""

Lawson added that she is ""very concerned,"" but hasn't decided whether or not to involve the DHS Office of Inspector General like Georgia did

Regarding the alleged penetration testing on Indiana's election system, a DHS spokesman said, ""DHS does not conduct scans of networks or systems without the cooperation and consent of the system owner.""

Idaho: Hey, DHS tried to hack our election website, too!

Indiana isn't alone with such recent DHS hacking claims as Idaho Secretary of State Lawerence Denney said he believes DHS may have attempted to hack its state election website around Nov. 8. It wasn't a Russian IP address mucking around in the state's affairs, but an IP address belonging to DHS, he said.

When Idaho ""looked at IP addresses that tried to get into our system,"" it didn't find ""a single IP address from a foreign country,"" but one from ""our own Department of Homeland Security.""

Denney also told the Post Register, ""I don't know what they [DHS] penetrated, or what they tried, I just know their IP address showed up as hitting our website. I don't know what they were doing. It would have been nice if they had told us.""

Denney expressed frustration that DHS conducted penetration tests without any warning or permission, adding that other secretaries of state across the country are also really concerned about what the election system designation of critical infrastructure will mean in the long run.

A DHS spokesman said it will address Denney's concerns, but ""when DHS conducts a cybersecurity scan of a network or system, we do so only with the cooperation and consent of the system owner.""

Similar hacking accusations by states that gave DHS permission to probe

After Georgia accused DHS of trying to hack its computer network and voter registration database, and DHS denied it , West Virginia Secretary of State-Elect Mac Warner accused DHS of attempting to hack West Virginia election records too, just as agency had allegedly tried to hack Kentucky's

Kentucky later claimed the alleged DHS IP address did not access ""public voter information and online voter registration websites."" Kentucky had granted DHS permission to conduct regular scans and concluded the ""IP address made no attempt to scan, attack, or infiltrate our system and that the visits appeared to be regular web traffic.""

Warner's claims about the West Virginia election records hack by DHS were disputed by then Secretary of State Natalie Tennant. Unlike Georgia, Indiana and Idaho, Tennant said West Virginia did grant DHS permission to do a ""cyber-hygiene scan prior to the election.""",0.4296376460685253,0.7296376460685253,-0.30000000000000004,0.0

WACO, Texas - Baylor University's Board of Regents announced today that the university has received a leadership gift - the largest capital gift in university history - from Elizabeth and Drayton McLane Jr. for Baylor's new on-campus football stadium alongside the Brazos River. With this naming rights gift, the McLane family asked that the new football facility be named Baylor Stadium. The generous gift will lead on-going fundraising to support stadium construction.

""We are fortunate to be a family that includes a number of proud Baylor University alumni,"" said Drayton McLane Jr., a 1958 Baylor graduate. ""We believe strongly in the University's distinct and important role as a Christian institution dedicated to academic excellence at the highest level. Our son Drayton III, a 1996 graduate of Baylor, and his wife Amy, and their sons Drayton IV, Brooks and Walker, as well as our son Denton, who graduated from Baylor in 1999, and his wife Amy, and sons Jeff and Jake, join us in joyfully making this gift to Baylor. As a family, we wanted to do something that would shine a light on the University we love, while enhancing student life at Baylor and impacting positively the city of Waco and Central Texas. This is an incredible time to be a Baylor Bear and all the McLane family is excited to part of the momentum that is leading Baylor to new heights.""

""Throughout our 167-year history, at what we now recognize as signature moments, visionary leaders have stepped out boldly to help propel Baylor and advance important University objectives,"" said Baylor President Ken Starr. ""We recognize that we are living in a remarkable time in the history of Baylor athletics, and we are blessed to have loyal, courageous and generous friends in Elizabeth and Drayton McLane, and their family, who have stepped forward to encourage all of us to take hold of a rare opportunity for our football program. Their significant leadership gift will secure Baylor's position among the nation's elite collegiate athletics programs, while providing our alumni, students and student-athletes a game day experience like none other in Baylor history. As a Baylor alumnus, Drayton has consistently demonstrated his profound love and support for Baylor through his distinguished service as a Regent and as chairman of the board. Previous expressions of generosity by the McLane family have impacted virtually every aspect of university life. We are humbled by this most recent gift which will create an important campus life tradition for our students and benefit all of Baylor Nation for generations to come.""

The new on-campus Baylor Stadium is expected to be built on a 93-acre site on Interstate 35, one of the nation's busiest highways, traversed by more than 42 million drivers annually. The stadium will hold 45,000 spectators, with the flexibility to expand to 55,000 in the future. It also will feature a bridge crossing the Brazos River and connecting the stadium to the campus, canopy shading for half of all seats throughout the day, open concourses with views directly into the stadium, suites, loge boxes, indoor and outdoor club seating, designated seating for Baylor students and the Baylor band, and an event center and Stadium Club for year-round use.

""We are extremely grateful, humbled and honored by the McLane family's generous lead gift for the new on-campus Baylor football stadium,"" said Bears' head football coach Art Briles. ""Their love and passion for Baylor is truly incredible, and this gift will impact not only Baylor football, but our great University, well into the future. The vision shown by both the McLane family and our University leadership will ensure continued success for our football program. I look forward to leading the Bears out of the tunnel and onto the field of the new Baylor Stadium.""

Baylor's Director of Athletics Ian McCaw also expressed his appreciation. ""We are deeply indebted to Drayton McLane and his family for this generous leadership gift. Drayton's vision and passion to develop a state-of-the-art, on-campus football stadium at Baylor will have a powerful and lasting impact on the football program, the University, Waco and Central Texas.""

The Baylor football team under Coach Briles completed a record-setting year in 2011, finishing 10-3 and No. 12 in the final ESPN/USA Today coaches' poll and 13th in the AP poll, the highest final rankings since 1986. Baylor's Valero Alamo Bowl championship team set or tied 129 school records, while Baylor quarterback Robert Griffin III won the Heisman Trophy, the most prestigious award in college football presented to the nation's best player.

Baylor football has been a mainstay on the Texas collegiate football landscape having played its first football game in 1899 at Carroll Field, an on-campus field adjacent to the university's academic buildings. Baylor played the majority of its home football games on campus until 1936, when it moved into the newly built Waco Stadium, where it played through the 1949 season.

Matt LeBlanc has reportedly signed a brand new Top Gear hosting deal worth a huge £2million after the BBC lost Great British Bake Off to rival Channel 4.

While co-host Chris Evans bowed out of the show after being panned by critics, the former Friends star fared a lot better, and is said to have been negotiating with the broadcaster to serve as the solo host after his contract expired in June.

According to a report, the BBC - feeling the pressure after losing GBBO - has now agreed to his stipulations, including working around filming of his US sitcom.

The Sun reports that the deal, agreed by BBC TV controller Charlotte Moore, will see most of his pay packet paid through the broadcaster's commercial arm BBC Worldwide, which means his salary won't be made public.

An insider told the newspaper: ""Bake Off going to Channel 4 was a disaster and a real blow. Losing Matt because of a few diary arrangements would have spun Top gear into crisis yet again.

""Charlotte looks like she has really aged in the last couple of weeks and had even offered Paul Hollywood a role on Top Gear to try and get him to stay.

""In the end they just wanted to sign up Matt as he's great with the fans and gives the show stability as it's due to start filming within days.""

Chris quit the show quit in June - a year into his three-year contract - after the final episode pulled in its lowest viewing figures since 2002.

Matt was paid an estimated £500,000 for the last series.

258631,False,1024,"Do you find it irritating having to set up an ad blocker on your computer web browsers, smart phones, and tablets? I sure do. And then there are some 'smart' devices at home that don't appear to have ad blocking software of any kind. Well, I learned about Pi-hole which is ad blocking software for your pi board and it blocks all the advertisements on your home network before they get to your various devices. It gives you the ability to black list or white list any domain, plus it has a great dashboard that gives you insights into your home network's most accessed domains/web sites, most active devices, and most frequent advertisers.

Pi-hole was really targeted to run on the Raspberry Pi but I wanted to know if it would work on my inexpensive Orange Pi running Armbian Linux. Well, it absolutely does! Below is my process for getting Pi-hole up and running quickly.

Installing Pi-hole

Installing Pi-hole is done using the terminal, so open a terminal on your Orange Pi's desktop or ssh into the pi board.

You will be downloading the software, so navigate to a directory of your choosing, making sure that you have write privileges. Like this:

cd <your preferred directory>/

I deviated from the ""one command"" installation on the Pi-hole home page. I mean, they do say right underneath that command that ""piping to bash can be dangerous"" and that a local install is ""safer."" So, here's my local installation steps:

git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/pi-hole/pi-hole.git Pi-hole cd Pi-hole/automated\ install/ ./basic-install.sh

If you are not logged in as the root user, then the basic-install script will prompt you to enter your password before continuing. If needed, the script will download and install some prerequisite Linux packages. Then it'll provide you with a simple blue/red graphical interface, prompting you to answer a few questions about how you want Pi-hole configured. In my experience, simply accepting the defaults was fine and I later discovered that the Pi-hole web application enables you to change settings like DNS provider.

The script will tell you what the password is for Pi-hole both in the graphical interface and in the terminal. Do take note of that password!

The script will also tell you the web address for Pi-hole, which should be like this:

http://<your pi's IP address>/admin

or even something like:

http://orangepipc/admin

You will need enter your Pi-hole password, and then you should get a nice dashboard that looks something like this:

Remember to change the DNS setting on your home network router so it that uses the address of your pi board. Otherwise, the ads won't be filtered!

The instructions above are more or less the same as the alternative ""safe"" method as provided by the Pi-hole web site despite the fact that Armbian is not listed as an officially supported operating system. I believe that these instructions should work on a Raspberry Pi or other pi board running some form of Debian based Linux operating system. However, I haven't tested that and I would be interested to hear your experience (just drop me a brief comment, please).


Thoughts and Observations

After running Pi-hole for a while an studying the information in the Pi-hole dashboard, I found that there was a lot more network activity going on than I was aware of, not all of which did I approve of. For example, there were some 'interesting' connections going out from my kid's devices related to game apps that I wonder about, plus social networking apps were apparently sending some data continuously which bothered me. Altogether, whether it was benign traffic or not, I was glad to reduce the traffic load even if by a little…I mean, why should I be content to allow apps and ads to eat up my network traffic for things I don't want or care about? Well, now they are blocked. Period.

Setting up an Orange Pi for ad blocking like this is cheap, easy, and helps to put my mind at ease about limiting some unwanted traffic to/from my home network (especially where the kids are involved). If you are interested, you can see my previous post about how to easily setting up an Orange Pi and check out how cheap the Orange Pis are at the links below. I believe that it is a worthwhile investment.

""It doesn't make any sense,"" he said. Completing such a filing, he continued, would be a ""waste of time."" He was supposed to file his current financial information on May 15, but was granted an extension.

During the primaries, Sanders called for ""complete transparency regarding the funding of campaigns."" Now, says NBC News, ""in the teeth of a Democratic primary where Sanders posed a bona fide threat to Clinton, voters couldn't definitively know whether Sanders — historically one of the Senate's least wealthy members — suddenly parlayed his political fame into personal profit. Or, for that matter, whether he sustained financial distress. The form Sanders didn't file would have detailed his finances through the middle of May 2016.""

There's a reason Sanders hasn't turned in his paperwork: like all good socialists, he gets touchy about his own finances. And he games the system.

This week, Sanders tweeted, ""To my Republican colleagues: If you don't have the guts to defend your ideas in a free election, get another job."" To which I quickly responded, ""You endorsed Hillary and then bought a vacation home, socialist hero.""

Charlie Shrem faced 30 years in prison…

Charlie is one of the earliest bitcoin millionaires.

He started a company called BitInstant in 2011. At its peak, the company handled 30% of all bitcoin transactions.

Shrem wanted to help unhook people from the banking system.

With BitInstant, everyday people could send funds anywhere in the world instantly… for fractions of a penny.

The profits were huge.

Charlie quickly realized the potential of bitcoin and amassed a personal fortune reported to be north of $20 million.

But his career got sidetracked…

In 2014, Charlie was charged with facilitating $1 million in unlicensed bitcoin transactions on the now-defunct drug-buying website Silk Road.

He initially faced 30 years in prison… but pleaded guilty to a lesser charge.

The judge in the case thought two years would be sufficient. Charlie eventually was released after serving a little more than a year.

In court, Charlie took responsibility for his crime. And he vowed to ""change the world"" by showing he had learned from his mistake.

And that's what he's doing today…

Changing the World… Again

Charlie is a pioneer in applying blockchain technology to business problems.

He did it first in the money transmission industry.

Now, he's dragging another market kicking and screaming into the 21st century.

Charlie and his business partner Jason Granger are using the same technology behind bitcoin (called the blockchain) to do it.

[The blockchain is a decentralized, secure digital ledger. It's revolutionizing the realm of digital transactions—everything from trade to music to real estate.]

It's a new way to invest in private enterprises while unlocking $4.2 trillion in ""frozen"" capital.

I'm talking about the private equity (PE) market…

PE is the money put into private companies that don't yet trade on public exchanges.

In traditional PE transactions, investors put money into a fund and a management company invests the money in private enterprises.

After seven to 10 years, the fund is liquidated and the investors get their money back, along with (hopefully) a good investment return.

Charlie and Jason are completely upending this practice. And giving investors control of their money back.

They've created a blockchain fund to make private investments. Here's how it works…

""Unfreezing"" $4.2 Trillion in Assets

Since 1989, the PE market has exploded from just a few billion to more than $4.2 trillion.

The problem is technology hasn't kept pace with the growth in assets.

Here's what I mean…

PE shares have virtually zero liquidity. Unless you are willing to pay large fees (10%–20%), you can't sell them and you can't borrow against them.

Compare that to the U.S. stock market. Nearly $20 trillion in public assets can be bought, sold, or borrowed against virtually any time of day or night.

That's because technology has made it easier, faster, and cheaper to buy, sell, and borrow against stocks. You can do it with the click of a mouse.

The same can't be said about PE shares. Your money is literally trapped until the private company goes public or is bought out.

Tying up $4.2 trillion in private capital is an enormous waste of resources.

But that's all about to change.

Charlie and Jason are creating a blockchain to fund and track private investments.

Here's how it works…

A New Type of Investment Fund

The name of Charlie and Jason's fund is Mainstreet Investment LP. The fund will invest in companies that are proven, profitable businesses.

The fund's diversified portfolio includes real estate assets, Main Street businesses, and blockchain opportunities.

Investors can buy cryptocurrency tokens that give them a stake in the fund. The tokens are essentially ""shares"" and are issued in an initial offering.

The plan is to distribute profits right back to the token holders.

So just like stockholders, token holders will receive cash dividends from companies in the portfolio.

Now here's what makes this project so special….

The transparent and tamper-proof nature of the blockchain makes it very easy to prove the value of each token. You can see what each token represents and its cash-flow history.

The digital tokens also make it easy to sell, lend, or borrow against their private holdings. And you can do all of that for zero commissions.

That has never existed before in the world of private equity.

But there is one drawback…

Currently, Mainstreet is only open to non-U.S. investors. If",0.0,0.7912983102723956,-0.8,0.0

Initially, Crews opted not to name the ""high-level Hollywood executive"" who allegedly groped him. But in a powerful interview with Michael Strahan on Good Morning America Wednesday, Crews spoke freely and frankly, holding no details back.

""Back in February 2016, I was assaulted by Adam Venit,"" Crews began, ""who is the head of the motion picture department at William Morris Endeavor, one of the biggest agencies in the world.""

The 49-year-old Brooklyn Nine-Nine actor attended an event with his wife and Adam Sandler, who is a client of Venit's. Though Crews knew many actors repped by Venit, he'd never met him before this first, disturbing encounter.

Crews described fielding stares from Venit all night and that Venit was ""sticking his tongue out"" in a way that made Crews uncomfortable. When Venit approached him, Crews offered to shake his hand. Instead, Venit squeezed Crews' genitals. Despite Crews' negative reaction, he said Venit just laughed and continued to harass him.

""I have never felt more emasculated, more objectified. I was horrified,"" Crews said. The actor credits his wife, Rebecca King, for encouraging him to exit the situation without violence.

As reported by Deadline last week, Crews filed a report with the Los Angeles Police Department against Venit for sexual assault. ""People need to be held accountable. This is an abuse of power. He's one of the most powerful men in Hollywood,"" Crews told Strahan.

Venit is currently on leave from his position at the head of WME's motion picture group.

He also represents Emma Stone, Diane Keaton, Shawn Levy, Vince Vaughn, Kevin James and Eddie Murphy. Venit began his career with Endeavor in 1996, before the company merged with William Morris Agency in 2009.

Crews faced criticism for sharing his story on Twitter without naming names.

""I will not be shamed. I did nothing wrong.""

But he added that when he did open up, encouraged by so many others coming forward, he felt an immense sense of relief. ""It freed me. I knew instantly, I had to tell my story, so that other people can be free.""",0.7224656492722127,0.8224656492722127,-0.1,0.0

Adrian Wade, 20, received a six-year prison term, after he pleaded guilty in D.C. Superior Court to assault with a deadly weapon and possession of a firearm in connection with the shooting.

JaJuan Smith, 18, obtained a two-year prison sentence, after he pleaded guilty to charges of acting as an accessory to the shooting and possessing an unregistered firearm and ammunition. But his sentence was suspended on the condition that he finish 18 months of supervised probation.

The shooting happened Feb. 7 on the 100 block of O Street SW, two blocks west of Nationals Park.

Wade first flashed a gun during an encounter with four juveniles near the Friendly Food Market at 1399 Half St. SW, prosecutors said. The victims then fled down the block.

Soon after, Wade encountered the group again about a block west of the market, prosecutors said. He then fired his gun at them four times, striking a 16-year-old boy in the ankle.

After unloading the shots, Wade handed the gun to Smith, who fled the scene and tossed the weapon in a bush, prosecutors said. Police recovered the gun and matched bullet casings at the scene to the weapon.

256893,False,1024,"Graham Adams shares his personal observations, experiences, and conversations from around Xinjiang. For Part I and Part II see here and here respectively.

Omnipresent state propaganda exhorts Uyghurs and other local ethnic groups to love and protect the Chinese state, which even in Xinjiang is ironically dubbed the ""motherland."" However, despite public campaigns as well as patriotic education in schools, it is clear that bright youth are questioning official political, historical, and religious narratives. Based upon interactions with students from all over Xinjiang (East Turkestan), it is clear that they are not passively absorbing and accepting official propaganda. On the contrary, they are thinking critically about their identity, their history, the role of the Chinese state in their lives, and most importantly, their collective future.

A common fear among Uyghur students is that the government is weakening and eroding the bilingual language policy currently in place. Although the government is eager to showcase its policy as evidence that it respects minority rights, in fact the bilingual schools are anything but bilingual. A Xinjiang high school teacher stated that although her students attend nine class periods per day, the only class conducted in Uyghur is the actual Uyghur language class. Teachers are not supposed to instruct students in other classes in Uyghur, even if the teacher and students are all native speakers and feel more comfortable speaking in Uyghur. Students revealed to me their concern that the ultimate goal of the government is assimilation. ""They don't want us to be Uyghur,"" they complained, ""they want us to be Chinese.""

Students and teachers in Xinjiang are prohibited from attending any religious activities. They are not allowed to pray at a mosque or fast during Ramadan. One teacher noted that in Kashgar, students are kept on campus during the early afternoon so that they cannot attend midday prayers. College students also lose college credit if they are caught attending religious activities on campus. Moreover, if teachers or students in Xinjiang fill out any official government form that asks for a religious identification, they must write ""none."" They are explicitly told that they can believe in nothing more than Marxism, despite China's constitutional guarantee of religious freedom.

The political situation in Urumqi is particularly tense now that the Party Congress is taking place. During noontime prayers on Friday, a Uyghur teacher must stand by the outer gate of an assigned mosque and make sure that none of his students attempts to enter the premises. If one does, he will receive a demerit from his school. A Chinese teacher accompanies the Uyghur teacher to ensure that the latter does not turn a blind eye to student rule-breaking. In addition, there are cameras inside and outside the mosque, as well as public security officers in the streets, to ensure that students do not enter. If students are caught, the teachers who failed to stop them are reprimanded as well.

The Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region government also forbids students and teachers from wearing headscarves or traditional hats on school campuses. One Uyghur professor with whom I spoke argued that these head coverings are a cultural marker, rather than strictly a religious marker. In fact, many Uyghurs have remarked that the July 2009 riots acted as a major turning point in their society. Since that time, the number of Uyghur women wearing headscarves has increased dramatically. They argue that they wear them to stand in solidarity with other Uyghurs as well as identify themselves as Muslim.

One day, I encountered a handful of students on a college campus wearing traditional hats and headscarves. I asked one of the young women why she chose to cover her head in spite of the ban. ""It's part of our culture,"" she responded. When I subsequently inquired what might happen if she continued to defy the ban, the student said that the school could choose to expel her. Such acts of resistance, albeit on a small scale, seemingly indicate the desire of Uyghurs and other Central Asian ethnic groups to assert their own identity as well as their rights.

Uyghur teachers are increasingly unemployed as more teaching jobs go to Chinese. I asked a teacher why it is difficult for young Uyghur college graduates with strong Chinese language skills to find employment in schools. She said that Uyghurs are asking the same question. Upon receiving applications from potential teachers with similar backgrounds, she has noticed that schools tend to give preference to Chinese applicants. The government has also imposed a new requirement that Uyghur teachers, even those who only teach Uyghur language classes, must have a certain level of proficiency in Chinese or they lose their jobs. This stipulation has proven challenging for many older Uyghur teachers.

One student to whom I spoke began to discuss Xinjiang's Central Asian neighbor, Uzbekistan. ""Our neighbors,"" he mused, ""share with us a similar language, a similar",0.7448016550827712,0.8448016550827712,-0.1,0.0

PORT ST. LUCIE — The city, the state and former Digital Domain CEO John Textor all will get multimillion-dollar payouts from a settlement in the two-year-old lawsuit against the defunct Digital Domain Media Group.

Port St. Lucie and the state — which both provided economic incentives to bring Digital Domain here in 2009 — each will get about $3 million, according to the settlement, which was approved Friday by a federal bankruptcy judge. Textor — who presided over both the creation and the bankruptcy of the high-tech digital-animation studio — will receive more than $8 million.

The state Department of Economic Opportunity filed the suit in July 2014 against 23 defendants, including Textor, claiming the company fraudulently secured millions of dollars from the state. The city joined the suit after it was filed.

The state said the company circumvented normal channels to secure $20 million in state incentive money, which it later used as leverage to secure millions more from Port St. Lucie and West Palm Beach, according to the lawsuit.

According to the lawsuit, company officials were able to work around normal economic-development channels by ""wooing"" former Gov. Charlie Crist.

Port St. Lucie gave Digital Domain $51.8 million in incentives, including land and a fully equipped, state-of-the-art studio in exchange for jobs and economic development. It will receive $3.2 million in the settlement, city officials said Tuesday. The state, which gave Digital Domain $20 million, will get about $3 million, state officials said.

""There was concern over throwing good money after bad, but we moved forward and fought the good fight,"" Mayor Greg Oravec said in a statement Tuesday. ""This prudent decision resulted in ... a big win for our citizens. This recovery does not fully repay the original investment. But, with the building sold to a caring and community-oriented new property owner, and this seven-figure payment soon to be in hand, we have made the most of a difficult situation.""

The state, too, considers the settlement a victory, although it blamed Crist for his swift support of the failed venture.

""The deal with Digital Domain was approved in 2009 under Gov. Charlie Crist,"" Cissy Proctor, executive director of the Florida Department of Economic Opportunity, said in a statement Tuesday. ""In 2011, under the leadership of Gov. Scott, DEO restructured the incentive process to prioritize accountability and transparency for the state's taxpayers, to ensure a deal like this doesn't happen again.""

Textor will receive an $8.5 million reduction on a mortgage on a property in Telluride, Colorado, according to court documents. Textor used the home to secure a $10 million loan for Digital Domain, he said.

Textor said he considers the ruling vindication.

""Had the court not ruled that the management team acted truthfully, the management team would be contributing to the settlement,"" Textor said Tuesday.

Textor said he would not be receiving a payout if there was evidence of wrongdoing on his part.

""After two years of evidence, the court ... and mediator further acknowledged there was no untruth told,"" Textor said. ""Obviously, we're pleased by the view of the court and the mediator.""

The payouts will be made by Digital Domain's insurance policy.

Digital Domain shuttered its doors in late 2012, just nine months after moving into its studio in Tradition, leaving more than 300 employees jobless and the city deep in debt. The city last year sold the 115,000-square-foot building to Christ Fellowship church for $13 million. It still owes approximately $35.2 million on the project, which includes interest.",0.4307442708148044,0.7307442708148044,-0.30000000000000004,0.0

Raven

""I am Raven, airborne death!""

The Raven is a form of ground attack aircraft armed with two Dark Lances and one Splinter Cannon. They are often used to annihilate the enemy's armour to make it easier for Raiders to move about the battlefield. Once they are done, they will continue to take down infantry until a path has been created for the main attack forces.

Tactics

By itself, the Raven is a decent anti-infantry vehicle and can even do moderate damage to vehicles. However, it is fragile and not as cost effective as Reaver Jetbikes against infantry. The key to the Raven is using it as a compliment in a quick moving advance. Be sure to travel with units equipped with Dark Lances, such as Ravagers or Scourges. Warp Beasts eat through armor fast too if you have them. The Raven can render enemy vehicles and structures impotent with the Short Circuit ability, and its partners can then quickly slice the target up with Dark Lances or teeth before they have a chance to strike back. This greatly increases the survivability of the powerful but fragile Dark Eldar. While Short Circuit is recharging Ravens can fulfill an anti-infantry role, using its mobility to escape when outmatched. Against other air units, Short Circuit should often be avoided. Many are weak enough that against Dark Lances they will drop too fast for Short Circuit to be worthwhile, others are fast enough to retreat until Short Circuit wears off. It can still be useful against powerful air units to buy time or fragile air units that can't escape in time.

SALT LAKE CITY — Police on Monday identified a man killed Saturday evening in a shooting in Sugar House.

About 7 p.m. Saturday, a motorist driving near 1224 E. Parkway Ave. noticed a man lying on the ground unconscious and not breathing. The motorist called police after realizing the man, later identified as Christian McDonald, 24, of West Valley City, had been shot in the torso.

McDonald was taken to a local hospital where he was pronounced dead, according to Salt Lake Police Sgt. Robin Heiden.

On the scene, police found a handgun with McDonald, as well as a blood trail leading a block east to Elizabeth Street.

Upon further investigation, police discovered McDonald was with another man in the area. The two got into an altercation and shot each other, Heiden said.

The other man went to a local hospital, where staff contacted police. The man has not been arrested, but police have identified him, according to Heiden. She said the man's relationship with McDonald is unclear and the investigation is ongoing.

""It wasn't a random event,"" Heiden said.

257051,True,318,"A white variant of Nokia's Lumia 1520 has popped up online sporting Verizon branding. And now begins the inevitable speculation. Having heard reports about a possible announcement later this month, it's been mostly unclear on which carriers we'll see the device end up. AT&T seems like a logical home. But now Verizon? With Nokia's Lumia brand set to pass on, perhaps Nokia's 1520 will be its last hurrah before spectacularly burning out. Better that then to fade away, or so the saying goes.

Found deep within the confines of China's Weibo, the picture reinforces some elements of the device's rumored design, and also some differences: 20-megapixel camera, dual-LED flash, and a potentially large display; we've been hearing it'll be 6-inch full HD, which will be made possible by Microsoft's upcoming GDR3 update for Windows Phone set to hit in (we think) October. Seeing as this device is headed to Verizon, it could be a model exclusive. Whereas AT&T got the 920, Verizon got the 928. This situation might play out in a similar fashion.

WPCentral isn't too convinced by the photo's authenticity, so let's take this with the usual grain of salt. With so many Android and iOS flagships flooding the market this holiday season, a Windows Phone phablet might not be the most enticing proposition out there. But, given that Microsoft will be in control of Nokia's handset business, this will likely be one of the last Lumias we'll see.",0.7095153461949104,0.7095153461949104,0.0,0.0

259385,True,622,"It hasn't been a good time to be one of the Bruins starting defenseman.

In each of the past four games, a defenseman has gone down to injury in the first period. After today's game, here's where the Bruins D men were in terms of regular season ice time (all situations, via stats.hockeyanalysis) and their status. Three of those four injuries were to top four defenseman, and the fourth was to their sixth defenseman.

Let's start with a quick rundown of the potential plays that injured the Bruins defensemen, and the dates

Game 81 vs Ottawa Senators, April 6

Torey Krug - Lower body

Defensemen TOI:

Game 82 vs Washington Capitals, April 8

Brandon Carlo - Upper body

Defensemen TOI:

Playoff Game 1 vs Ottawa Senators, April 12

Colin Miller - Lower body

Defensemen TOI:

Playoff Game 2 vs Ottawa Senators, April 15

Adam McQuaid - Upper Body

Defensemen TOI:

Over these past four games, the Bruins have been down to five defensemen for just under 80% of the time, with 179:29 out of a possible 257 minutes spend down a defenseman. The least amount of time in a game spent like this? The 45 minutes after Colin Miller's knee injury in game 1. He returned to the bench in the second period, but didn't take a shift past 15 minutes into the game. Which defensemen are eating up those minutes lost? Looking at the difference in their ice time the past four games compared to their regular season averages can give us a clue. Since Charlie McAvoy didn't play in any regular season games, we have nothing to compare him to, so whatever minutes he gives the Bruins is just found money.

Some quick takeaways:

Charlie McAvoy has gotten the trust of Cassidy, and fast. Although it's not like he's had any choice given his options on the right side

Kevan Miller has seen his ice time rise considerably, rising to Chara levels in the regular season

Chara has had a more measured increase in ice time, mainly because there's only so many more minutes he can play

Looking back at the game two defensemen ice time, there was a clear top three that Cassidy leaned on, the two non injured top six defensemen from the regular season, and the fresh faced rookie, all over 27 minutes, with the fourth D man 7 minutes away, and the fifth defenseman at about half the ice time of the big three

Pretty obvious: They can't keep losing a defenseman every game, and they EVENTUALLY have to get one or two (Colin Miller and/or Brandon Carlo seem like the likely candidates, with Torey Krug the outside shot)

I'll take the blame for McQuaid getting hurt. And I really hope I didn't jinx Kevan Miller as well, he's been solid.",0.0,0.6361925471876617,-3.6,0.0

Variety is reporting that Youtube will acquire Twitch for over $1 billion dollars. According to the article, both Youtube and Twitch have declined to comment at the time. Google's YouTube has reached a deal to buy Twitch, a popular videogame-streaming company, for more than $1 billion, according to sources familiar with the pact.


The deal, in an all-cash offer, is expected to be announced imminently, sources said. If completed the acquisition would be the most significant in the history of YouTube, which Google acquired in 2006 for $1.65 billion. The impending acquisition comes after longtime Google ad exec Susan Wojcicki was named CEO of YouTube earlier this year.

The article also states that YouTube is prepared for the deal to be challenged by the Justice Department, as the two companies together account for a large share of the online video market.

The talks are at an early stage, and a deal isn't imminent, the people said. The potential purchase price couldn't be learned. Twitch also has considered raising additional funding instead of selling the company, according to one of the people.

257863,False,1024,"During the period of fast economic growth in the 2000s, how did poor minorities fare? Some heartening answers have been provided in a Columbia University paper by Panagariya and More (Poverty by Social Religious and Economic groups in India and its Largest States, 1993-94 to 2011-12). Poverty has declined much faster for dalits and tribals than for upper castes or the overall population. And it has declined faster for Muslims than for Hindus or the national average.

Using the so-called Tendulkar poverty line (which is close to the UN and World Bank's poverty line), the two economists calculate that in the seven years between 2004-05 and 2011-12, the all-India poverty ratio fell by 15.7%. The decline was much higher at 21.5% for dalits and 17.0% for tribals. The decline in the poverty ratio of the upper castes was much lower, at 10.5%.

This represents very substantial progress in poverty reduction. In the earlier decade, between 1993-94 and 2004-05, the decline was only 9.6% for dalits and 3.7% for tribals. The overall poverty ratio declined by 8.0%.

In as many as 12 states, the poverty ratio for dalits was actually lower than the national average. This is an astonishing achievement which shows that the caste gap, which once yawned as wide as the Brahmaputra, is now closing fast. In the Hindi heartland (nicknamed the BIMARU states), dalit progress continues to be modest. But in southern and western India, dalit poverty has fallen dramatically. It is lowest in Kerala and Tamil Nadu.

The news for Muslims is also good. Their poverty ratio declined in this seven-year period by 18.2%, faster than the 15.6% for Hindus. The absolute level of Muslim poverty remains higher than of Hindus. But the gap has almost halved, from 6.1% in 2004-05 to 3.5% in 2011-12. In rural areas, the difference has almost disappeared. But in urban areas it remains high. Muslim literacy and school graduation rates are far lower than for Hindus, partly because of lower school enrolment of girls. Unsurprisingly, this leads to a poverty gap between the two communities. The good news is that the gap in both poverty and school enrolment is closing.

The Sachar Committee in 2006 portrayed Muslims as a disadvantaged community, especially in education, bank loans and representation in government jobs. But it revealed that Muslim poverty was declining much more sharply than Hindu poverty. That trend has continued.

Panagariya and More provide a whopping surprise: in as many as seven states, Muslims are less poor than Hindus. This is unsurprising in Kerala, where Muslims have been major beneficiaries of migration to and remittances from the Gulf. But the ratio is even lower in Tamil Nadu. In four states it is below 10%, and in the fifth, Gujarat, it is 11.4%.

The authors also look into the rural and urban divide. Astonishingly, the rural Muslim poverty ratio is lowest of all in Gujarat, at 7.7%. This is much lower than the urban ratio, and so raises the question whether it is a statistical quirk. Muslims in Gujarat were victims of terrible violence in 2002, and many still feel unsafe. But their economic position has improved a lot.

Poverty is lowest for Jains, followed by Sikhs and Christians. So, most minorities do well in India. Muslims are an exception.

The Sachar Committee implied that Muslims were in some ways as badly off as the dalits. Not so for poverty ratios. In 2011-12, 25.4% of Muslims were below the poverty line, much better than dalits (29.4%) or tribals ( 43%).

Some caution is required in interpreting the data. First, 2004-05 was a bad monsoon year while 2011-12 witnessed a good monsoon, and this may exaggerate the achievement in this period. Second, the year-wise variations in some states look very steep, and seem to need a pinch of salt. Third, the government has decided to create a new poverty line, and all the data will have to be recast after that. Yet there can be no doubt that the overall trend is excellent.

Panagariya and More conclude that rapid GDP growth in the seven years between 2004-05 and 2011-12 must have been the main cause of record poverty reduction, with its attendant inclusiveness for dalits and Muslims. Some socialists will disagree, saying poverty fell mainly because of government schemes like MNREGA, the rural employment programme. But this cannot explain the especially sharp fall of poverty in urban areas. Income inequalities as measured by NSSO surveys do not show improvement, and indeed have worsened slightly. The main cause of declining poverty has",0.0,0.7540195893883801,-1.2000000000000002,0.0
255891,False,1024,"Puerto Ricans like to say that politics is the national sport, and who could argue with that? With a participation rate hovering near 80% and campaigning that features elaborate floats, loud music, and a carnival atmosphere, election day on the island comes off like a mix between Super Bowl Sunday and Mardi Gras. So when the results came in this week that a majority island voters had selected the statehood option on this year's plebiscite, it would seem to be an unprecedented, game-changing event.

After all, in two of the three previous plebiscites, Commonwealth--the current status, which supporters call ""free associated state"" and detractors call ""colony,""--was the clear winner. When the dust cleared and the 2012 tally was in, the numbers were striking: 61.2% of 1.8 million voters said they were in favor of statehood! The world would hold its breath to see if Congress could allow a 51st star would be added to Old Glory.

But it's not quite that simple. This was not your everyday straightforward plebiscite with Statehood, Commonwealth, and Independence (remember that?) options. It came out of a tortured political process that involved consultation with the President's Puerto Rico Task Force and in the end was never authorized by Congress. The plebiscite that Puerto Ricans voted for Tuesday involved a two-step process.

The first part of the vote asked ""Are you satisfied with the current territorial status?"" On that question, 54% voted no. Keep in mind that if you voted no here, you weren't necessarily against Commonwealth per se, you simply weren't satisfied with the current version of Commonwealth. The second question was ""Which status do you prefer?"" and the choices were Statehood, ""Sovereign Free Associated State"" (an as yet undetermined non-territorial hybrid of commonwealth and independence), and Independence.

This vote went to Statehood (61.5%), with ""Sovereign Free Associated State"" winning 33.3% of the vote and Independence 5.5%. A clear victory, right? Not exactly. During the campaign leading up to the vote the Popular Democratic Party, which represents the Commonwealth option, had been urging their followers to simply enter a blank vote in protest of the way the plebiscite was constructed, in their opinion to favor the statehood-supporting New Progressive Party.

So if you factor in the 466, 337 blank votes, Statehood only wins 45.1% of the total votes, and if you add the Sovereign Free Associated State and the blank ballots together, that would come to 51% of the votes, in other words, the same result of the plebiscites held in 1967 and 1993. In fact, it's almost a mirror image of the 1998 plebiscite, which was won by ""None of the Above,"" the option campaigned for by the PDP in protest of that statehood-party authored plebiscite, by a margin of 50.3% to 46.5%.

To complicate matters even further, Luis Fortuño, the incumbent pro-statehood governor, was shockingly defeated by his Commonwealth party rival Alejandro García Padilla, leaving the statehood victory without its primary advocate. ""This was first and foremost just an opinion poll that was never a binding resolution,"" said William Ramirez, head of the ACLU in Puerto Rico. ""It's up to the party in power to go to Washington and slap it on someone's desk and fight for it.""

In fact, all that incoming governor García Padilla is obliged to do under the law is send a letter to Washington stating the results. It can be argued that even if Fortuño won, he would have faced difficulty explaining why statehood should be considered when the option won only a plurality and not an absolute majority (over 50%) of the votes.

It is conceivable that Pedro Pierluisi, the island's incumbent resident commissioner (non-voting member of Congress), who is not only pro-statehood but a member of the Democratic Party with ties to Obama, might be able to argue the case, but that seems dubious given the absence of power of his office. Pierlusi was running again as running mate to Fortuño (who is staunchly Republican). He was re-elected to Resident Commissioner. A recent paper published by Latino Decisions in anticipation of Tuesday's vote states that ""lawmakers are not likely to accept the outcomes of a status plebiscite that was not authorized by Congress.""

For his part García Padilla has already announced that he will hold a Constitutional Convention in Puerto Rico in 2014 and seek a new plebiscite that would be approved by Congress.

Still, the incoming governor would do well to address the dissatisfaction with the current status that has been expressed by a majority of Puerto Ricans. Certainly the trend over the last several years has been disen",0.6375960735688833,0.7375960735688832,0.0,-0.1

The move further promotes the Apple Watch as a health and fitness tracker with a focus on using it at work.

9to5Mac Happy Hour

The centerpiece of your corporate wellness program. From practicing mindfulness to reaching fitness goals, wellness keeps employees healthy and energized. Apple Watch is designed to work seamlessly with your corporate wellness program so employees stay active, healthy, and productive throughout the day.

Apple promotes apps including Vitality, Lose It!, and Virgin Pulse that are available on the Apple Watch and have been used in wellness programs so far. A dedicated email address (corporatewellness@apple.com) is also available for companies to contact Apple with when exploring an Apple Watch wellness program.

Apple Watch tracks steps, calories burned, and specific workouts which companies can incentivize to encourage healthy behavior and boost productivity. The microsite also highlights apps like Messages, Calendar, and Hours Tracker that can be used at work.

Apple says companies with fewer than 100 employees can start their own wellness program with Apple Watch by buying hardware at Apple Stores; companies with 100+ employees can contact Apple ahead of time.

Next, Apple says pick a wellness program focus and which apps will be used in the program. Finally, Apple offers personalized assistance for each employee in the wellness program as part of the initiative.

Earlier this year, healthcare company Aetna announced its own wellness program that relies on the Apple Watch to encourage activity and healthy living.

255544,True,921,"In the race to move energy off Canada's West Coast, David Black hasn't garnered much attention. The soft-spoken newspaper magnate is, after all, an outsider, a man with a giant dream to build a refinery near Kitimat, B.C., but pockets too small to make it happen.

Now Mr. Black says he is a month away from signing an early agreement toward a staggering $25-billion in debt financing to build pipelines, supertankers and one of the largest refineries on Earth.

""We hope to sign this within the next 30 days. We haven't signed it yet,"" the founder of Victoria-based Black Press Ltd. said Wednesday. ""It is a memorandum of understanding that is fairly broad, and we'll be negotiating the details down the road, which is typically the way these things are done.""

Story continues below advertisement

In the oil patch, the refinery plan has been met with skepticism, given that Mr. Black's experience lies in newspapers, not the complex and enormously expensive world of refining crude. Industry analysts have expressed doubts about his ability to sign firm contracts for fuel sales. They say it could be tough to persuade Canadian oil companies to sell their product in British Columbia, which could curb their ability to secure high prices in the competitive Asian marketplace.

On Wednesday, in a breakfast speech before the Vancouver Chamber of Commerce, Mr. Black sought to quiet some doubters.

For the past several months, he has worked with Oppenheimer Investments Group, a Swiss firm that has financed airports around the world and a new city in the Middle East.

""When we put a project together, we don't do the traditional funding and walk away,"" said Richard Cooke, Oppenheimer's senior managing director for the Americas and Africa. ""We are there from start to finish. So we will be working with David from the permitting to the building to the final end, when the refinery is producing.""

Unveiled last August at a cost of $13-billion, the Kitimat project is now expected to cost $25-billion: $16-billion for the refinery, $6-billion for an oil pipeline, $2-billion for a natural gas pipeline and $1-billion for supertankers.

Oppenheimer has never done anything on that scale.

""Our specialty is in $1-billion to $3-billion projects. We have done projects over $10-billion,"" Mr. Cooke said in an e-mail.

Story continues below advertisement

Story continues below advertisement

But, he told the Vancouver audience, initial deals are in place to cover the entire cost. ""We have arranged and we have the funding committed to do this whole project,"" he said.

The Kitimat project is the single-largest private investment ever envisioned in British Columbia.

Mr. Black envisions a 550,000-barrel-a-day diluted bitumen refinery that would transform oil sands product into fuels like gasoline, diesel and jet fuel. If built, it will bring with it 3,000 operational and 6,000 construction jobs, and a way to have B.C. profit from oil moving across its territory.

Mr. Black has also argued for its environmental merits, saying greenhouse gas emissions – which he is hoping to cut in half using new technology – will be produced whether oil is refined in Canada or China.

Coastal waters, he says, will be easier to clean up in case of an accident with refined fuels. And he says there is an economic case to be made for a B.C. refinery, which can use cheaper parts manufactured in Asia and secure access to cheaper oil from Alberta.

The latter calculation may, however, prove difficult. Canada's energy industry has sought Pacific exports largely because it wants higher Pacific prices.

That could make it difficult for Mr. Black to secure Alberta oil – and analysts say it may be dangerous to build a project on the assumption that North American oil will stay cheap for decades to come.

""You're not going to see these $40 discounts like you are today. They're not going to last,"" said Steve Fekete, manager of downstream energy consulting with IHS.

The sheer cost of the project, and its remoteness, are also likely to prove difficult hurdles, he said.

(Or, reading tips for dealing with fake 'racist uncle' think pieces this Thanksgiving.) But, yes, those parade floats are wonderful! And as harmless as their six-foot-wide grins and bulging eyes the size of car windshields might seem, there's an element of danger in 70 people marching a Spongebob that contains 16,200 cubic feet of helium through Manhattan once a year.

Go ahead, Google ""Macy's Day Parade,"" and you'll find an entire Wikipedia section dedicated to ""Incidents and Injuries."" There are entries every few years with phrases like ""head ripped off"" and ""impaled."" But there was one year in particular, 1997, that was a total goddamn disaster. High winds caused chaos and destruction on the New York streets and one woman ended up in a month-long coma.

On Thanksgiving morning 1997, an estimated two million people gathered along the parade route to catch The Pink Panther, Barney, Cat in the Hat, and others happily float between the Manhattan skyline. But, as The New York Times reported the next day:

""At times, the balloons were not gliding but instead were careering as their handlers on the ground struggled to keep control in winds that reached as high as 43 miles an hour. For a while, the balloons seemed to be falling like flies. Barney suffered extensive damage and had to be removed at 51st Street. The Pink Panther succumbed at 42d Street. Quik Bunny and the Cat in the Hat limped away at 36th Street.""

A video from that day (see above) captures Barney's particularly violent death.

Notice the drama of the handlers trying to keep control.

And the surges of cheers/yells as the balloon rips apart. There's wind ripping at the camera, and the kid's cryptic commentary as Barney goes down.

Meanwhile, ""As the Pink Panther lurched about, while simultaneously imploding, a police inspector shouted, 'Somebody give me a knife, quick!' An officer quickly handed him a 5-inch-long knife and he punched a hole through the feline's tail, a move that almost immediately stabilized the balloon.""

But the worst problem that year occurred at 72nd Street and Central Park West, when a six-story-tall Cat in the Hat struck a lamppost. As Pat Klem, who videotaped the incident, told the Times:

""You thought it was going to bounce off,"" he said. ""But the second time it snapped -- it was suspended for an instant, then it spiraled way down ... The parade just stopped. There was a prolonged silence. Your thoughts go from happy, joyous Thanksgiving to prayers.""

Maria Clohessy and Kathy Caronna both suffered head injuries during the incident. And, a year later, CNN reported that Caronna ""Suffered a skull fracture from falling debris and was in a coma for nearly a month. Caronna, who is still recovering and says the accident caused permanent brain damage, filed a $395 million lawsuit against the city, Macy's and the lamppost manufacturer.""

In response to what happened at the Macy's Day Parade in 1997, organizers implemented new size rules, that ""balloons can be no larger than 70 feet high, 78 feet long and 40 feet wide. That meant bidding farewell to a few lumbering creatures: the Pink Panther, Woody Woodpecker and the Cat in the Hat.""

258423,True,692,"JavaScript Hoisting

Hoisting is JavaScript's default behavior of moving declarations to the top.

JavaScript Declarations are Hoisted

In JavaScript, a variable can be declared after it has been used.

In other words; a variable can be used before it has been declared.

Example 1 gives the same result as Example 2:

Example 1 x = 5; // Assign 5 to x


elem = document.getElementById(""demo""); // Find an element

elem.innerHTML = x; // Display x in the element


var x; // Declare x Try it Yourself »

Example 2 var x; // Declare x

x = 5; // Assign 5 to x


elem = document.getElementById(""demo""); // Find an element

elem.innerHTML = x; // Display x in the element

Try it Yourself »

To understand this, you have to understand the term ""hoisting"".

Hoisting is JavaScript's default behavior of moving all declarations to the top of the current scope (to the top of the current script or the current function).

The let and const Keywords

Variables and constants declared with let or const are not hoisted! Read more about let and const in JS Let / Const.

JavaScript Initializations are Not Hoisted

JavaScript only hoists declarations, not initializations.

Example 1 does not give the same result as Example 2:

Example 1 var x = 5; // Initialize x

var y = 7; // Initialize y


elem = document.getElementById(""demo""); // Find an element

elem.innerHTML = x + "" "" + y; // Display x and y Try it Yourself »

Example 2 var x = 5; // Initialize x


elem = document.getElementById(""demo""); // Find an element

elem.innerHTML = x + "" "" + y; // Display x and y


var y = 7; // Initialize y Try it Yourself »

Does it make sense that y is undefined in the last example?

This is because only the declaration (var y), not the initialization (=7) is hoisted to the top.

Because of hoisting, y has been declared before it is used, but because initializations are not hoisted, the value of y is undefined.

Example 2 is the same as writing:

Example var x = 5; // Initialize x

var y; // Declare y


elem = document.getElementById(""demo""); // Find an element

elem.innerHTML = x + "" "" + y; // Display x and y


y = 7; // Assign 7 to y Try it Yourself »

Declare Your Variables At the Top !

Hoisting is (to many developers) an unknown or overlooked behavior of JavaScript.

If a developer doesn't understand hoisting, programs may contain bugs (errors).

To avoid bugs, always declare all variables at the beginning of every scope.

258134,True,537,"(Reuters) - California Governor Jerry Brown signed new insurance requirements on ridesharing companies into law on Wednesday, but the regulations come at a far lower cost to the industry than previously written into the bill, officials said.

Companies such as Lyft, Sidecar and UberX, which is a part of black-car service Uber, allow passengers to summon paid rides using apps on their smartphones and have gained in popularity in dozens of U.S. cities over the past few years.

But they face opposition from taxi companies that argue the upstarts do not face the same stringent regulations as do traditional cabs, and insurance companies want ridesharing drivers to carry more expensive insurance policies.

The law requires ridesharing companies' insurance to cover drivers from the moment they turn on their app, not just from when they accept a ride on their app, according to information from the office of California Assemblywoman Susan Bonilla, who championed the bill.

Drivers under the new law must maintain primary liability insurance coverage of at least $50,000 per person and $100,000 per occurrence for death and personal injury during the time they log on to the application, as well as $30,000 for property damage, her office said. The insurance can be paid by the driver or the rideshare company.

An earlier version of the bill required $750,000 worth of insurance coverage in that window, down from $1 million in the previous draft, it said.

The move to dictate more extensive coverage stems from a New Year's Eve incident in San Francisco when an UberX driver killed a child while his app was on, but before he had accepted a ride.

""We have agreed to a compromise that provides clarity for the ridesharing community in California,"" Lyft spokeswoman Chelsea Wilson said in a statement.

Uber spokeswoman Eva Behrend said: ""We are our proud that our governor has recognized that Californians love Uber.""

The companies, which initially opposed stricter requirements, ultimately supported the final bill after Bonilla agreed to lower the amount of insurance required when drivers do not have passengers in their vehicles, Bonilla's office said in a statement.

The driver must also maintain $1 million for personal injury and property damage from the time a ride request is accepted until the passenger exits the vehicle, her office said.

256729,False,1024,"With tapering looming on the horizon, and many observers predicting the Fed to start hiking interest rates very soon, the rupee has been plunging downwards to record lows. Low interest rates in the US have long been a major reason why liquidity has flowed into emerging economies, but the tide could now be turning.

India and the rupee are particularly vulnerable to the change in expectations, due to its sizeable current account deficit amounting to $18.1bn in Q1, and $31.9bn in the previous quarter (equal to 3.6% of GDP and record 6.7% of GDP). Concerns that India will not be able to fund the shortfall through capital inflows, such as foreign direct investment, result in depreciation of the currency.

Especially large imports of crude oil have raised some alarm, seeing as oil prices react to events relating to Syria, and with India importing nearly 80% of its oil, it is in a highly vulnerable position, where higher oil prices would lead to higher inflation and thus larger current account deficit.

At this point, the rupee has lost 20% of its value in 2013, making it one of the world's worst-performing currencies. According to Vishnu Varathan, economist at Mizuho Bank Ltd. ""this is unprecedented, and we are in uncharted territory for the rupee,"" adding that he expected the rupee to fall to the 70 mark against the US dollar. In vain attempts to stop the rupee from sliding, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has implemented various measures, such as

restricting the sums that companies and individuals may send out of the country

increasing the duty on gold imports three times in 2013

increasing the RBI's interest rate on lending to other banks and capping banks' daily borrowings

while nevertheless having the nerve to deny that any of these amount to real capital controls: ""There is no question of us putting any restriction on outflows… There is no control of outflows of dividends, profits, royalties, or on any kind of commercial outflows"", according to Department of Economic Affairs Secretary Arvind Mayaram. ""With rising NPAs, corporates are getting more and more into difficulties… So looking into their balance sheet before they are allowed to invest abroad is all that has been proposed. Hence, it is not capital control"". Furthermore, Mayaram argued that ""Gold, silver, platinum are what we believe as non-essentials. We have put curbs on that"".

Despite the unwillingness to call capital controls by their real name, RBI worry is even clearer in another attempt at stopping the rapid depreciation, namely a pilot project that will be launched soon, according to a source familiar with the RBI's plans to curb the plummeting currency. This project has the stated goal of making Indian banks buy up gold from private households.

The RBI will ask the banks to buy back jewellery, bars and coins for rupees, because the 31,000 tonnes of commercially available gold in the country – worth $1.4 trillion at current prices – could patch up the current account, even if only some of it was bought up. India imported 860 tonnes of gold in 2012 alone, and the hope is that if a little of that privately held gold is monetized, the current account deficit will be taken care of.

This idea completely ignores the fact that Indians buy gold to get out of the rupee. Specifically, Trade Minister Anand Sharma said that in a country with 31,000 tonnes of declared gold ""even if 500 tonnes is monetized at today's value it takes care of your current account deficit"".

At the end of the day, capital controls by alternative names and gold monetization schemes do not resolve anything, so long as India's current account deficit remains as gaping as ever. Little will change, and the rupee will suffer. The Banyan blog on the Economist lists three options for the Indian government:

let the rupee fall further . Most countries like a cheap currency, since it boosts exports ceteris paribus, but in the case of India, its industry is too small and too bound in red tape, so a weaker currency may add to inflation and to subsidies, worsening the current account deficit.

This, however, will hurt domestic industry, which is already struggling, and probably increase bad debts at banks too. Inducing a credit crunch in India might make things even worse.

257576,True,808,"← Beginning Fortran | Fortran simple input and output →


In programming, a variable is a container for data that the program can change. You typically declare variables before you use them to provide information on what kind of data they should store. However, Fortran allows variables to be created implicitly. Absent an IMPLICIT statement, undeclared variables and arguments beginning with I through N (the ""in"" group) will be INTEGER , and all other undeclared variables and arguments will be REAL .

Many consider using variables without declaring them bad practice. If you want to be forced to declare variables, code IMPLICIT NONE first.

Examples of variables:

INTEGER , PARAMETER :: num_days_week = 7 ! declare a constant, whose value cannot be changed INTEGER :: i , j ( 2 ), k ( 0 : 1 ), m ( 3 , 4 ) ! declare i as an integer, j as an array of 2 ! integers from j(1) to j(2), k as an array ! of 2 integers from '''k(0)''' to k(1), and m as a 2-dimensional ! array of 12 elements REAL :: c ( 0 : 3 ) ! declare c as an array of 4 floating point numbers from c(0) to c(3) CHARACTER ( LEN = 5 ) :: word ! declare word as a string of length 5 LOGICAL :: tf ! declare a boolean variable with values .TRUE. or .FALSE.

The following does exactly the same thing, but in the shorter, more archaic form:

INTEGER , PARAMETER :: num_days_week = 7 DIMENSION j ( 2 ), k ( 0 : 1 ), m ( 3 , 4 ), c ( 0 : 3 ) CHARACTER * 5 word LOGICAL tf

If memory layout counts to you, note that m(1,1) is followed in memory by m(2,1), and not by m(1,2).

A variable can be set by placing it before an equal sign, which is followed by the value to which it is set. Given the declarations above, the following assignments are possible:

i = 3 * 4 ! set i to 3*4 = 12 j = ( / 1 , 4 / ) ! set j(1) to 1, j(2) to 4 c = ( / 1.0 , 4.0 , 5.0 , 9.0 / ) ! set c(0) to 1.0, c(1) to 4.0, c(2) to 5.0, c(3) to 9.0 word = 'dog' ! set word = ""dog "" . The variable word is padded with spaces on the right tf = . TRUE . ! set tf to True

A variable can appear on both sides of an assignment. The right hand side is evaluated first, and the variable is then assigned to that value:

i = 3 ! i has value 3 i = i ** i ! i has value 3**3 = 27

Variables can be converted from one type to another, but unlike in C++ or Java where you would typecast the variable, in Fortran you use the intrinsic procedures:

REAL :: r = 1.5 DOUBLE PRECISION :: d = 1.5 INTEGER :: i = 1 PRINT * , DBLE ( r ), DBLE ( d ), DBLE ( i ) ! Convert number to a double precision PRINT * , REAL ( r ), REAL ( d ), REAL ( i ) ! Convert number to a single precision (REAL) PRINT * , INT ( r ), INT ( d ), INT ( i ) ! Convert number to an integer

This pic is


bigger

A boy, seemingly wounded, sits quietly in a brand new, very well equipped ambulance. At a point he touches what looks like a wound on his left temple. He shows no reaction to that touch.

The two minute

), from which the pic is taken, shows the boy being handed from the dark above to some person in a rescue jacket and carried into the ambulance. There he sits quietly, unattended, while several people take videos and pictures of him. One other kids, not obviously wounded, is then carried to the ambulance.

As the story is told:

Mahmoud Raslan, a photojournalist who captured the image, told the Associated Press that emergency workers and journalists tried to help the child, identified as 5-year-old Omran Daqneesh, along with his parents and his three siblings, who are 1, 6 and 11 years old. ""We were passing them from one balcony to the other,"" Raslan said, adding: ""We sent the younger children immediately to the ambulance, but the 11-year-old girl waited for her mother to be rescued. Her ankle was pinned beneath the rubble.""

An internet search for ""Mahmoud Raslan"", the claimed ""photojournalist"", finds no other pictures or videos attributed to that name.

There are about 15 men standing around the scene and doing nothing. (Next to a ""just bombed"" site in a warzone? No fear of a double-tap strike?) At least two more men, besides the videographer, are taking pictures or videos.

Another kid is carried into the ambulance. In the background there is someone with a white helmet wearing a shirt of the U.S./UK financed ""White Helmets"" propaganda group.

An animated wounded man is walked towards the ambulance.

Like the boy, the man seems to have a wound at the upper head. But like the boy he is not bleeding at all. There is some red colored substance on his face but no blood is flowing. That is astonishing. When I rode ambulances as a first-responder, people with head wounds always bled like stuck pigs (they often messed up the car which I then had to clean). As WebMD notes:

Minor cuts on the head often bleed heavily because the face and scalp have many blood vessels close to the surface of the skin. Although this amount of bleeding may be alarming, many times the injury is not severe ...

The amount of red colored substance on the boy and the man do not correspond to the amount one would expect from even a minor head wound. There are also no bandages applied or anything else that could have been used to stop an actual head wound from bleeding.

Compare the above to this recent picture from a boy in west-Aleppo. (No ""western"" media showed this boy and his suffering. He is not on ""our side"".) The boy suffered a head wound after an improvised missile from al-Qaeda and its associates hit his neighborhood. He is in care, the bleeding has been stopped. The amount of blood on his body and soaked into his cloth is a multiple of that seen in the above pictures. The blood is also mixed with the other dirt on his face, not painted over. This looks like those patients in my ambulance. This looks real.

All attributes of the ""boy on orange seat"" scene and of the video are the same that can be found in dozens of ""White Helmets"" videos. It is the same theme that occurs over and over again in our picture collection Dramatic Rescue! Man With Kid Runs Towards Camera!.

I am inclined to believe that the video above is just as staged as the other ""White Helmets"" videos and pictures. The look of the boy's wound is a bit more realistic than usual but the lack of bleeding, that no one attends to the boy, his non-reaction to touching the ""wound"" and the general setting of the video scene lets me believe that it is staged.

This new, widely distributed propaganda item comes again at a moment where al-Qaeda and its associates in Syria are in trouble. The Russian air force is hitting them in the rear area of their attack on west-Aleppo and it is hurting them badly. A ""humanitarian ceasefire"", which can then be used to reorganize and resupply, is urgently needed. The propaganda helps to increase the pressure for such a demand.

Some of its sponsors want the ""White Helmets"" nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize. The organization itself lobbies for it on its website. Has anyone else ever done such?

257703,True,370,"Only six percent of Americans think minor marijuana possession should be punishable by jail time, according to a new Reason-Rupe poll. The poll also found that a strong plurality of Americans think the use or possession of small amounts of marijuana should not be punishable at all.

When asked, ""Which approach do you think government and law enforcement should take toward someone found smoking marijuana or in possession of a small amount of marijuana?"", six percent of respondents said possession should be punishable with jail, 20 percent said it should result in mandatory substance abuse counseling, 32 percent said users should incur a fine, and 35 percent of respondents said people caught with small amounts of marijuana should not be punished at all.

The Reason-Rupe poll is one of the few instances--possibly the first--in which the usual polling dichotomies of incarceration v. treatment and criminal penalty v. civil penalty have been expanded to include no penalty whatsoever. The results suggest that Americans are comfortable with the idea of decriminalization--which reduces the penalty for minor marijuana possession to a civil fine--and more sympathetic than ever to the idea of fully legalizing possession.

256122,True,359,"""Meow"" means ""Whoa, man... that's deep."" Bubbles that will drive your kitteh bonkers

Made from catnip oil for an irresistible scent

8 ounces of catnip bubble solution and bubble wand

The person who wrote the first sentence of the Wikipedia article on catnip deserves a high-five: ""Nepeta cataria is mostly used as a recreational substance for feline enjoyment."" So true, random contributor, so true. With the effects that 'nip (as it's known on the streets) has on the average kitteh, it's amazing the stuff isn't illegal. Kittehs on the 'nip have been known to roll around with reckless abandon, chase after things that aren't there, drool excessively, and suffer from extreme wide-eyed paranoia.

Nepetalactone is the organic compound in catnip that causes your kitteh to go wild, that is, unless your particular kitteh lacks the 'nip gene. One in four cats will never do 'nip; they're just not interested. Cosmic Catnip Bubbles are the new drug on the street, luring many a kitteh into 'nip abuse much like ""cheese"" lured dumb middle schoolers into getting hooked on heroin. (We're pretty sure your cat is smarter than the average middle schooler... at least until catnip is involved.) Cosmic Catnip Bubbles are made just like regular bubbles, but with the addition of catnip oil for maximum kitteh craziness. Each bottle contains 8 ounces of bubble solution and a bubble wand for you for optimal bubbly Nepetalactone delivery.

An Android Tool Time Pro Tip

If you've written much Android code, you've probably made this mistake at least once:

Toast.makeText(MainActivity.this, ""This will not be displayed"");


What if I told you there was a way to guarantee you can avoid this mistake, and also use fewer keystrokes?

What is this magic I speak of? Live Templates!

If you're an experienced IntelliJ user, you're probably already aware of Live Templates — in which case skip ahead to the Android-specific templates included in Android Studio

Unless you're getting paid by the keystroke, no one wants to write repetitive boilerplate code. It's easier to show than explain, so here's how they work.

Live template to (correctly) create and display a new Toast

As you can see, Live Templates are shortcuts displayed as code-completion options that, when selected, insert a code snippet that you can tab through to specify any required arguments.

For example, as shown above — typing ""Toast"" then hitting the Tab key inserts the code for displaying a new Toast with argument placeholders that you can enter, before hitting tab and moving on to the next argument.

256537,True,446,"For a few open jobs, statistics and performance count when general manager Matt Klentak and his skipper review each player on the bubble to decide the four reserve slots on the Philadelphia Phillies.

The Nitty-Gritty:

When it comes to choices, necessity always trumps luxury because more of a strength doesn't fix a weakness.

For the most part, the bench has the only positional competition: two outfielders, one infielder and a backup catcher. And even though the decisions involved appear small, each spot is important during almost every game. Rarely does a manager finish a contest without considering his reserves for pinch-hitting, late-game defense or a double switch for an overextended pitcher. To complicate things, moreover, regulars drop any experimentation and use the last three weeks to prepare for the campaign.

If you consider their status, the two backups with a shot to go north in April are roster-protected players and invitees. However, Klentak must remove or disable someone from the 40-man roster if an extra participant makes the squad. In other words, those athletes are at a disadvantage from day one.

Entering camp, Andrew Knapp had the inside track for the back half of the catching tandem, but he isn't hitting or ready to play first base. Of course, the plan was for Knapp to back up the regular receiver and starting first baseman, while Jorge Alfaro would handle the games behind the plate for the Triple-A Lehigh Valley IronPigs. However, if this position is still a problem at March's end, Klentak has backstops Ryan Hanigan and Bryan Holaday.

While Tom McCarthy's team recently broadcasted a weekend game, two fans watching at home voiced their evaluation regarding the infielders. One asked the other who besides Andres Blanco is going to be a utility man. Will it be Jesmuel Valentin, Hector Gomez, Pedro Florimon or Taylor Featherston? Well, Valentin was at Lehigh Valley last summer and his father and uncle played in the majors. Yeah, I thought his name sounded familiar, but who are the others?

One other consideration: For years many sellers have complained about clumping in search results - when only a few seemingly select shops/items are displayed in the first page(s) of a search for a specific item; sort of like what is described in the original post. I've seen Etsy responses to some of those complaints and they assure everyone that ""clumping"" is not something they do, but that they do look into the issue on a regular basis. Perhaps, over time, they've discovered something that could be causing ""clumping"" and have taken action to prevent it, hence giving everyone a fair shot at having their pencil case show up on the first page.

The outbreaks of police violence at a handful of polling locations served to heighten tensions in the Catalan capital, potentially boosting turnout for a vote that could have significant consequences for the autonomous region's future, and that of Mariano Rajoy's Spanish government.

After polls closed Rajoy made a televised address reiterating that voters had been tricked by Catalonia's political leaders, and that the national police had simply responded in accordance with their orders.

Ricard Gene, 56, a commercial lawyer who had volunteered to help at a polling station inside the Miquel Tarradell secondary school in Barcelona's Ciutat Vella - or Old City - said he was shocked by the images of violent police tactics that played out across his city, as ordinary citizens sought to vote in a referendum that Spain's constitutional court had already declared illegal.

""We thought it would be hard, but never this hard,"" he told CNBC as he handed out ballot papers to Catalans who trickled in to the secondary school's entrance hall.


He had walked just fifteen minutes that morning from home to his assigned voting location, where the school foyer was filled with tables, ballot boxes and fellow volunteers. By mid-afternoon his team had ushered ""hundreds, maybe thousands"" of voters through the process.

259624,True,545,"Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro at a rally at in Caracas on June 14. (Marco Bello/Reuters)

All this year, as they trudged through an unprecedented economic implosion, Venezuelans have been gearing up for what was meant to be the defining political event of the year: a referendum on whether to recall our increasingly loathed authoritarian president, Nicolás Maduro. The tense buildup suddenly ended Thursday as five separate (and supposedly independent, but c'mon now) lower courts approved injunctions to suspend the recall, closing down Venezuela's last best hope for a peaceful solution to its long-running political crisis.

Even for battle-hardened Venezuelans, it all came as quite a shock. A major signature-gathering drive to officially activate the recall vote was scheduled for next week. Opposition activists were busy preparing their plans to get out their voters to sign. No one, not even the military, seemed to have been expecting this.

Today has been a day of sober reckoning in Caracas, as Venezuelans process the death of the recall process and its implications. It's easy to overdramatize these things, I realize, but it's also important not to lose the forest for the trees: a relatively large, relatively sophisticated major oil producer just three hours' flying time from the United States has just become the second all-out, no-more-elections dictatorship in the Western Hemisphere.

This is serious. A turning point.

See, for 17 years, political scientists have been casting about for a suitable way of describing the strange in-between political system Hugo Chávez invented for Venezuela. It wasn't quite democracy in the usual sense, clearly, but it also wasn't a normal dictatorship. The government might not have had much time for the fine print of constitutional rule, but in broad terms people were basically free to associate, speak and vote. What do you call that? Competitive authoritarianism? A hybrid regime? An illiberal democracy? None of the labels seemed to stick; what did stick was the lasting impression of in-betweenness, of Venezuela as not-quite-a-dictatorship.

For Venezuela's pro-democracy activists, fighting a regime that has instituted dictatorship by tiny increments has been an exhausting ordeal. Which is why today, mixed with the genuine anger at the subversion of our constitutional right to a recall, you can detect just a hint of gratitude for the clarity this brings.

We're rid of the adjectives. We are finally through with the academic circumlocutions.

Almost 200 hectares of the city's 2,270-hectare historical texture now boast world heritage status.

Yazd is now the only UNESCO-listed Iranian city where people still live. It is also believed to be the world's largest inhabited adobe city.

Registering the site on the coveted list was a tougher task than Iranian officials had hoped. The ancient city's dossier was supposed to be considered for inscription last year but was deemed incomplete by UNESCO's assessors who gave Iran a long list of shortcomings that had to be redressed to improve its chances of inscription on the coveted list.

Cultural heritage authorities have envisioned a buffer zone of around 665.93 hectares for the designated area.

Yazd is home to UNESCO-listed ancient Persian qanats as well as Dolatabad Garden, which is one of nine Iranian gardens inscribed collectively on the World Heritage List as ""the Persian Gardens"".

The city is known for its adobe architecture, Zoroastrian fire temples and tall structures known as badgirs, or wind-catchers, which in ancient times functioned as natural ventilators in large buildings.

With 22 world heritage sites, Iran is ranked first in the Middle East and 11th worldwide. The 11-day session of the World Heritage Committee will end on July 12.

Parents told the governor that officials would not listen to them when they drew up their list of names of missing children, reaching 234.

The discrepancy in the figures could not immediately be resolved.

""There are ways to fix such dangers. One option would involve allocating public funds to repair and revitalize the infrastructure in question. Of course, such services are difficult in an era of reduced tax revenues and massive public resistance to financial support of infrastructural projects in the first place.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - In his first call as president with Russian leader Vladimir Putin, Donald Trump denounced a treaty that caps U.S. and Russian deployment of nuclear warheads as a bad deal for the United States, according to two U.S. officials and one former U.S. official with knowledge of the call.

When Putin raised the possibility of extending the 2010 treaty, known as New START, Trump paused to ask his aides in an aside what the treaty was, these sources said.

Trump then told Putin the treaty was one of several bad deals negotiated by the Obama administration, saying that New START favored Russia. Trump also talked about his own popularity, the sources said. The White House declined to comment. It referred Reuters to the official White House account issued after the Jan. 28 call, which did not mention the discussion about New START.

It has not been previously reported that Trump had conveyed his doubt about New START to Putin in the hour-long call.

New START gives both countries until February 2018 to reduce their deployed strategic nuclear warheads to no more than 1,550, the lowest level in decades. It also limits deployed land- and submarine-based missiles and nuclear-capable bombers.

During a debate in the 2016 presidential election, Trump said Russia had ""outsmarted"" the United States with the treaty, which he called ""START-Up."" He asserted incorrectly then that it had allowed Russia to continue to produce nuclear warheads while the United States could not.

Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said he supported the treaty during his Senate confirmation hearings. During the hearings Tillerson said it was important for the United States to ""stay engaged with Russia, hold them accountable to commitments made under the New START and also ensure our accountability as well.""

Two of the people who described the conversation were briefed by current administration officials who read detailed notes taken during the call. One of the two was shown portions of the notes. A third source was also briefed on the call.

Reuters has not reviewed the notes taken of the call, which are classified.

The Kremlin did not immediately respond to requests for comment. CONCERNS OVER PHONE CALLS

The phone call with Putin has added to concerns that Trump is not adequately prepared for discussions with foreign leaders.

Typically, before a telephone call with a foreign leader, a president receives a written in-depth briefing paper drafted by National Security Council staff after consultations with the relevant agencies, including the State Department, Pentagon and intelligence agencies, two former senior officials said.

Just before the call, the president also usually receives an oral ""pre-briefing"" from his national security adviser and top subject-matter aide, they said.

Trump did not receive a briefing from Russia experts with the NSC and intelligence agencies before the Putin call, two of the sources said. Reuters was unable to determine if Trump received a briefing from his national security adviser Michael Flynn.

In the phone call, the Russian leader raised the possibility of reviving talks on a range of disputes and suggested extending New START, the sources said.

New START can be extended for another five years, beyond 2021, by mutual agreement. Unless they agree to do that or negotiate new cuts, the world's two biggest nuclear powers would be freed from the treaty's limits, potentially setting the stage for a new arms race.

New START was ratified by the U.S. Senate in December 2010 by a vote of 71 to 26. Thirteen Republican senators joined all of the Senate's Democrats in voting for the treaty, although Republican opponents derided it as naive.

The call with Putin was one of several with foreign leaders where Trump has turned to denounce deals negotiated by previous administrations on trade, acceptance of refugees and arms control.

In a phone call with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, Trump questioned an agreement reached by the Obama administration to accept 1,250 refugees now being held by Australia in offshore detention centers.

Selfie statue in Sugar Land, Texas. (Photo: Sugar Land Parks and Recreation via Facebook)

Venus figurines from the Paleolithic Period. King Tut's mask, sculpted by the ancient Egyptians. Michelangelo's David during the peak of the Renaissance. Even Mount Rushmore in the 1900s.

These are all key points along the evolutionary timeline of sculpture, and are viewed as quintessential representations of the art form during their eras. (Yes, I took art history in college. Don't judge me.)

A bronze statue recently erected in Sugar Land, Texas, may have captured the next benchmark in the annals of art history.

Sugar Land, a suburb of Houston, unveiled a ""selfie statue"" in Town Square Plaza, outside City Hall.

The statue shows two girls posing for a selfie, and it has pretty much everything you could expect from two girls posing for their next Instagram post.

To run through the checklist:

• Infinity scarf. Check.

• Rain boots. Check.

• Slightly-above-eye-level phone positioning for optimal downward angle. Check.

• The quasi-squat, because standing normally just doesn't cut it. Check.

The statue is part of a 10-piece collection donated by Sandy Levin, a Sugar Land resident through the Sugar Lane Legacy Foundation, according to the city's website. The selfie statue was installed along with a statue of a man playing guitar, a project valued at $32,500.

Plans for the sculpture have been in the works since at least 2014, according to a city Parks and Recreation agenda from spring of that year asking the City Council to review the statue proposal.

The project was part of the City Council's mission of ""Building Community: Diverse Cultures, Leisure, Arts,"" according to the document.

A public works agenda from September 2014 shows the measure passed through City Council — the recommended action became ""accepting donation from Sugar Land Legacy Foundation.""

As one could expect, the city is facing some backlash on social media.

It was his real-time, face-to-face conversations with the people he met that earned Crawley friends from across the country, said Eric ""Ferg"" Ferguson, now general manager at Hooters on South Westnedge Avenue.

Steven D. Crawley, 45, formerly of Dowagiac, died Wednesday, Feb. 20. He had been undergoing regular kidney dialysis for more than a year, Ferguson said.

Crawley and Ferguson were roommates in their days as students at Western Michigan University , and worked together as doormen -- bouncers-- at Waldo's in the early 1990s, Ferguson said, before working their way up to bartender status. ""He loved the kids, loved the excitement"" of working in a campus establishment, Ferguson said. ""He was always upbeat.""

Crawley was a talker, Ferguson said, and could easily regale the bar with stories, even those he may have told before, of growing up in Dowagiac and the mischief he and his brother got into. But he was also a great listener, allowing patrons to guide the course of the conversation, his co-worker said.

Always upbeat and cheerful, Crawley had the knack of being honest with people, Ferguson said. ""If stuff was wrong, he'd tell you. If someone was bitching and moaning about something"" that was basically their own fault, ""he'd tell them, 'You know, you caused that.' ""


Crawley was an avid Los Angeles Lakers fan, and loved the University of Michigan, but his conversations went far beyond sports.

""He was a very smart individual, and could talk about anything ...,"" said Ferguson, ""whatever the topic of the day was.""

Crawley also had that special trait of a good bartender. ""He knew what everyone wanted to drink at all times, and that's a huge skill. You want your drink, don't want to wait,"" Ferguson said.


He said his friend had been on disability leave for quite some time, and was undergoing kidney dialysis a few times a week for more than a year-and- half before his death.

He kept up his spirits throughout, Ferguson said. ""He was either up, or getting up,"" he said.

When news of his death reached the patrons at Waldo's on Wednesday night, ""I bought a round and we offered up a toast"" to Crawley, said Bruce Hayes, the general manager at Waldo's.

He, too, was a friend and former roommate of Crawley. He said people have been dropping in this week to reminisce and inquire about arrangements, even though it has been three years since Crawley last worked there.

Hayes said Crawley was well liked by employees and customers alike, and could as easily speak to young college students as he could their professors.

""He remembered details about people,"" Hayes said.

Hayes said Crawley concocted a popular drink of flavored vodka, lime juice and little water that he named after himself, and ""in the past few days, people have been ordering them.""

Ferguson said: ""There are a lot of folks that miss him and love him throughout the country, and he has friends all over. A lot of people ... wish they could have come by and said goodbye.""

256387,True,726,"A group of protesters at Amherst College in Massachusetts has released a set of demands that include punishing students who produced a poster celebrating free speech by subjecting them to re-education for the sake of ""racial and cultural competency.""

In response to ongoing protests at the University of Missouri, which saw an attack on journalists Monday trying to cover the event, some students at Amherst this week put up small posters on campus. The posters read ""In memoriam of the true victim of the Missouri protests: Free Speech (1776-2015),"" and included a short ""eulogy"" which reads as follows:

Who is constrained by the invisible barriers of our generation's safe spaces. Censored for the open forum of non-conflicting opinions. Trod upon to build a community of comfort. And violently persecuted for a safer, less vitriolic world. Let us honor the life of the first amendement, and the heroes that it protected: Journalists, Educators, Philosophers, and Free Thinkers everywhere.

The poster never mentions race, and ends with a short quip ""If you want to protest this sign, feel free. Because that's why the First Amendment exists.""

But Amherst activists want to do far more than proest. They want the people responsible for the poster punished, along with those responsible for producing signs which said ""All Lives Matter."" A coalition of more than 50 campus groups held a ""sit-in"" Thursday night, which led to them producing a lengthy list of demands that includes punishing anybody who made the signs:

""President [Biddy] Martin must issue a statement to the Amherst College community at large that states we do not tolerate the actions of student(s) who posted the 'All Lives Matter' posters, and the 'Free Speech' posters,"" the list of demands says. ""Also let the student body know that it was racially insensitive to the students of color on our college campus and beyond who are victim to racial harassment and death threats; alert them that Student Affairs may require them to go through the Disciplinary Process if a formal complaint is filed, and that they will be required to attend extensive training for racial and cultural competency.""

Let that sink in: A poster celebrating the First Amendment was ""racially insensitive"" and requires ""extensive training for racial and cultural competency.""

Students demand a great deal more as well. They request that Amherst's honor code be updated to include ""reflect a zero-tolerance policy for racial insensitivity and hate speech,"" meaning students could be punished and perhaps expelled for racial insensitivity, which apparently includes defending free speech. They also demand that the school suppress its unofficial sports mascot Lord Jeff, whom they say has an ""inherent racist nature.""

The demands are endorsed by students from more than 50 Amherst student groups, including the Black Students Union, Amherst United Left, and Amherst Christian Fellowship.

Amherst has been given until Nov. 18 to respond to the student protesters. If the school considers any punishment of faculty, staff, or administrators who support them, they warn it will ""result in an escalation of our response.""

FALSE

Example: [Collected via e-mail, December 2002]


They work more effectively against us than the enermy's armies. They are a hundred times more dangerous to our liberties and the great cause we are engaged in. It is much to be lamented that each state, long ago has not hunted them down as pests to society and the greatest enemies we have to the happiness of America — The Jews.

It is much to be lamented that each state, long ago has not hunted them down as pests to society and the greatest enemies we have to the happiness ofJews.


Origins: Anti-Semitic screeds are nothing new; neither, unfortunately, is the practice of attempting to legitimize them by attributing them to the pens and tongues of

respected figures. After all, if as esteemed a person as George Washington — the Father of Our Country, the first President of the United States of America, the man who ""could not tell a lie"" — said that Jews were a dangerous scourge who should be hunted down as pests, there must be something to it. At the very least, the apocryphal attribution lends an unwarranted credibility to those who would repeat it for their own racist purposes.

This quote is a recasting of something Washington did say, providing just enough of an aura of authenticity to sound believable. What Washington actually wrote referenced currency speculators who sought to profit by taking advantage of soldiers and others during the Revolutionary War:


This tribe of black gentry work more effectually against us, than the enemy's arms. They are a hundred times more dangerous to our liberties, and the great cause we are engaged in. It is much to be lamented that each State, long ere this, has not hunted them down as pests to society, and the greatest enemies we have to the happiness of America.


Washington's private life and writings reveal no evidence of anti-Semitism, and his public attitude towards religious tolerance was well expressed on a 1790 goodwill visit he paid to Newport, Rhode Island, during his first term as President. When a goodwill address was presented to him by the Hebrew Congregation of Newport, Washington responded by penning ""the first presidential declaration of the free and equal status of Jewish-American citizens"":


The Citizens of the United States of America have a right to applaud themselves for giving to Mankind examples of an enlarged and liberal policy: a policy worthy of imitation. All possess alike liberty of conscience and immunities of citizenship. It is now no more that toleration is spoken of, as if it was by the indulgence of one class of people that another enjoyed the exercise of their inherent natural rights. For happily the Government of the United States, which gives to bigotry no sanction, to persecution no assistance, requires only that they who live under its protection, should demean themselves as good citizens.

(WHNT) - Many went back to work at Redstone Arsenal on Monday. Many others have to wait out a government compromise.

But when we questioned Congressman Mo Brooks (R-District 5) about the shutdown, he downplayed the overall economic effects.

""A government shutdown has an adverse effect on our economy, although we've had through the 1970s and 1990s, we've had 17 government shutdowns, and as you know, we had a thriving economy in the 80s and in the 90s.""

Brooks says spending has spun out of control, and he says he'll use all possible tools to curtail it.

""I am quite willing to do whatever I can with respect to continuing resolutions, appropriation bills, debt ceiling votes, to try to get those in Washington who are financially irresponsible to start doing the right thing,"" said Rep. Brooks.

But is there any hope for those tactics that brought the government to a halt?

Congressman Brooks thinks Republican House leadership could still get its way.

He says even now he can envision a circumstance where the Democratic Senate votes to push back the Affordable Care Act.

""Under the right circumstances it's possible. We'd have to see how those circumstances unfold. Today, unlikely. Tomorrow, maybe,"" he said.

But for Brooks, it always comes back to spending, and he's not scared of using government shutdowns or debt ceiling hikes to make his point.

""If I have to use those bills to cajole them to start thinking about the long-term consequences of spending money we don't have, then I'll do it.""

Plus, Congressman Brooks has a slightly different view of the consequences of hitting the debt ceiling.

""There is no circumstance in which America would default on its loans unless that's what the President wants to do to punish the American people under the circumstances that we're in. We have roughly $2.5 trillion in revenue per year, and interest on our debt is in the neighborhood of a quarter of a trillion dollars.""

But at the same time, the congressman continues to warn of the dangers of the government's mounting debt, claiming we could hit outright bankruptcy soon.

""It would be this decade. If we continue borrowing money at a rate of a trillion dollars a year, then we will probably see an insolvency and bankruptcy within this decade,"" Rep. Brooks said.

He does add, ""Don't get me wrong. I believe we're in a circumstance where we have to raise the debt ceiling, but at the same time, we have to be good stewards of taxpayers money and demand -- demand -- that there be a concurrent decrease in our spending so that we're on a path to solvency as opposed to a path of bankruptcy and insolvency.""

More than 48,000 global citizens have now signed a petition at www.nukefree.org asking the United Nations and the world community to take charge of the stricken Fukushima nuclear plant. Another 35,000 have signed at www.rootsaction.org . An independent advisory group of scientists and engineers is also in formation.

The signatures are pouring in from all over the world. By November, they will be delivered to the United Nations.

The corporate media has blacked out meaningful coverage of the most critical threat to global health and safety in decades.

The much-hyped ""nuclear renaissance"" has turned into a global rout. In the face of massive grassroots opposition and the falling price of renewable energy and natural gas, operating reactors are shutting and proposed new ones are being cancelled.

This lessens the radioactive burden on the planet. But it makes the aging reactor fleet ever more dangerous. A crumbling industry with diminished resources and a disappearing workforce cannot safely caretake the decrepit, deteriorating 400-odd commercial reactors still licensed to operate worldwide.

All of which pales before the crisis at Fukushima. Since the 3/11/2011 earthquake and tsunami, the six-reactor Daichi site has plunged into lethal chaos.

For decades the atomic industry claimed vehemently that a commercial reactor could not explode. When Chernobyl blew, it blamed ""inferior"" Soviet technology.

But Fukushima's designs are from General Electric (some two dozen similar reactors are licensed in the US). At least four explosions have rocked the site. One might have involved nuclear fission. Three cores have melted into the ground. Massive quantities of water have been poured where the owner, Tokyo Electric (Tepco), and the Japanese government think they might be, but nobody knows for sure.

As the Free Press has reported, steam emissions indicate one or more may still be hot. Contaminated water is leaking from hastily-constructed tanks. Room for more is running out. The inevitable next earthquake could rupture them all and send untold quantities of poisons pouring into the ocean.

The worst immediate threat at Fukushima lies in the spent fuel pool at Unit Four. That reactor had been shut for routine maintenance when the earthquake and tsunami hit. The 400-ton core, with more than 1300 fuel rods, sat in its pool 100 feet in the air.

Spent fuel rods are the most lethal items our species has ever created. A human standing within a few feet of one would die in a matter of minutes. With more than 11,000 scattered around the Daichi site, radiation levels could rise high enough to force the evacuation of all workers and immobilize much vital electronic equipment.

Spent fuel rods must be kept cool at all times. If exposed to air, their zirconium alloy cladding will ignite, the rods will burn and huge quantities of radiation will be emitted. Should the rods touch each other, or should they crumble into a big enough pile, an explosion is possible. By some estimates there's enough radioactivity embodied in the rods to create a fallout cloud 15,000 times greater than the one from the Hiroshima bombing.

The rods perched in the Unit 4 pool are in an extremely dangerous position. The building is tipping and sinking into the sodden ground. The fuel pool itself may have deteriorated. The rods are embrittled and prone to crumbling. Just 50 meters from the base is a common spent fuel pool containing some 6,000 fuel rods that could be seriously compromised should it lose coolant. Overall there are some 11,000 spent rods scattered around the Fukushima Daichi site.

Dangerous as the process might be, the rods in the Unit Four fuel pool must come down in an orderly fashion. Another earthquake could easily cause the building to crumble and collapse. Should those rods crash to the ground and be left uncooled, the consequences would be catastrophic.

Tepco has said it will begin trying to remove the rods from that pool in November. The petitions circulating through www.nukefree.org and www.moveon.org , as well as at rootsaction.org and avaaz.org, ask that the United Nations take over. They ask the world scientific and engineering communities to step in. The Rootsaction petition also asks that $8.3 billion slated in loan guarantees for a new US nuke be shifted instead to dealing with the Fukushima site.

It's a call with mixed blessings. The UN's International Atomic Energy Agency is notoriously pro-nuclear, charged with promoting atomic power as well as regulating it. Critics have found the IAEA to be secretive and unresponsive.

But Tepco is a private utility with limited resources. The Japanese government has an obvious stake in downplaying Fukushima's dangers. These were the two entities that approved and built these reactors.

While the IAEA is imperfect, its resources are more substantial and its stake at Fukushima somewhat less direct. An ad hoc global",0.28230120019289107,0.7823012001928911,-0.4,-0.1

259792,False,1024,"Luigi Auriemma is truly and iconically a visionary.

Now, there are a lot of specifications and definitions out there, so I'll save you the legwork of researching for clarity:

Visionary - noun: a person of unusually keen foresight; a person who is given to audacious, highly speculative, or impractical ideas or schemes; (and finally, probably most relatable) dreamer.

Don't believe me? Take it from the person who probably knows best. Here's UConn Associate Head Coach Chris Dailey from ""UConn '95: Birth of a Dynasty:

""We really focused on what we had. We didn't get caught up in what we didn't have. We focused on Geno & I as coaches. Our vision.

Starting a program, building a program. Being apart of that foundation. Right from the beginning, we've always focused on 'here's what we have:'

We have good people.

A toughness.

People who know how to play basketball.

& those players helped us recruit more talented players but still, with the same mindset.""

At the time, it just seemed like common sense. Nothing too farfetched or overdramatic.

Fast forward to now, 999 wins later. Everyone wants to know the secret. Everyone wants into UConn's practice.

Everybody (now that Stewie's gone) wants to play UConn since they can't simulate what playing them is like. Everybody wants a piece of the pie.

But, Geno has been and will always be the first to tell you, it's just basketball. UConn just does it better than anyone else, and it's not a special drill or special potion. It begins and ends (not really — there's a ton of help from CD that goes unseen) with the Geno Auriemma effect.

Born from Italian parents who emigrated to Norristown, Pennsylvania when he was seven-years-old, Auriemma is the embodiment of the oft-misplaced concept of the ""American Dream."" Thankfully for basketball junkies like myself, the dream he chose to chase was his own.

Given his first opportunity to coach at St Joseph's University a year after graduating in 1978, Auriemma got to learn from one of the absolute best in Jim Foster, who is still coaching and currently serving as the head coach of the Chattanooga Mocs of the Southern Conference.

Ironically enough? His fellow assistant coach on that staff was none other than Notre Dame Head Coach Muffet McGraw. Talk about iron sharpening iron. It's no wonder they've all been successful. Imagine having your late night basketball junkie conversations consist of that caliber of IQ. I salivate just thinking about it.

Following a two-year return to coaching his high school boys team, Auriemma joined the University of Virginia women's basketball coaching staff as an assistant for four seasons under the incomparable Debbie Ryan. Immediately, two legends in the game — Ryan remained the UVA coach until retiring following the 2010-11 season, opening the door for current Head Coach JoAnne Boyle (who coached my sister) — got to show Geno Auriemma the ropes.

So, as much as one might try and call it luck of the draw, something is revealing to me that this was more destiny. A calling, if you will.

The last interview of the bunch, Auriemma was up against a strong selection of female coaches ready to take the reins of the UConn program for themselves. One of those names? Chris Dailey. Lore shows that if Geno had turned down the position, she would've been the hire. Maybe this will kill the question about why CD never leaves. She's where she wanted to be all along.

Remember the vision from before? Well, please bear in mind: This was literally, just a vision.

""Anything that remotely would describe what you would need to recruit good players to come to Connecticut? None of that was here.

There was no 'hey, come play at Connecticut.

Hey, come play in our conference.

Hey, come play in our building. Come to this school & get a great education.

Hey! Come live in this beautiful, vibrant college community.'

No. 'Hey! Come stay in our world-class dorms.'

No. There wasn't one tangible thing that you could put your finger on & say 'this is why you should come to Connecticut.""

Wife Kathy even goes on to say, confidently, that she never imagined staying at UConn, and never got an inkling of such from Geno early on either. He was even quoted as saying he would ""do three or four years here then move on to a real school that takes women's basketball seriously.""

It was the spring of 1981, I was 3 weeks old and my 27-year-old mother brought me in for a well-baby check up. After listening to my outrageously loud heart beat the doctor told her, ""I don't think your baby's heart has formed properly."" He then took me away from her for hours of tests and shortly discovered that I had a Ventricular Septal Defect (VSD). In layman's terms, I have a hole in my heart, a condition that many Americans are born with. I have to be monitored throughout my entire lifetime and find doctors who intimately understand my case for possibly over 90 years (I expect to have a long life). The likelihood that my doctors retire or kick the bucket before I do is pretty strong. In fact, it's already happened. My transition from my beloved pediatric cardiologist to my series of adult cardiologists has been a 15-year struggle causing panic, frustration and a whole heck of a lot of confusion.

In 1981, doctors didn't really understand the extent of my problem. In fact, to this day they are still learning about it. Back then, doctors would have had to cut open my chest and crack open my rib cage to get to my heart. As a newborn, doctors felt that surgery would have been more fatal than living with the condition itself.

I was fortunate to have a cutting edge specialist in pediatric cardiology in my hometown at the University of Kentucky, Dr. Jackie Noonan. Dr. Noonan closely and intimately monitored my condition for my entire upbringing. She believed the hole would begin to close over time and was not too eager to cut into me in order to fix it. She was right. However, it never completely closed. She continued to see me once a year for EKG's and ultrasounds to check my condition for changes or improvements. She discussed the possible need for surgery, but being a believer in science, she encouraged my parents and I to wait for medical advancements before operating.

When I was 18 years old, I moved to NYC for college and had to visit a doctor on the Upper East Side for my yearly check-up. When the Doctor walked in, she took my mother aside and said, ""I think we have a problem... this issue is serious...her heart is putting pressure on her lungs...and it's our recommendation that she has open heart surgery now to fix this."" Of course, my mother panicked and then told ME NOT to panic (yeah right?!). She drove all night (12 hours) to get to the pediatric cardiology unit at UK for Dr. Noonan to take a look at me. Dr. Noonan did tests on my heart and my lungs and then reported that I was totally fine-- my lungs were perfect and nothing was any different with my heart than the year before.

Well, that was the last time I went to any other doctor besides Dr. Noonan for 10 years! I would fly home to KY every year to have my heart checked and she would tell me I was good to continue living as ""normal."" And, I did! In those 10 years, I led a very active life. I ran 5 miles a day at least five days a week, biked or walked to and from my jobs in NYC, and performed 8 shows a week in three high intensity Broadway shows.

At 28 years old, I moved to Nashville, TN to pursue my lifelong dream of writing and singing country music. Dr. Noonan had retired and I found a recommended adult cardiologist at a hospital in Nashville known for their heart healthcare. The doctor called me within 10 days of my visit with a solemn voice that sounded like he was about to break some bad news... He said there were serious abnormalities, arrhythmias and that I would need to get open-heart surgery within 4-6 months. HUH?! He then went into the details of the operation, the size of my scar, the recovery time and started listing dates I could have the surgery on. I was in shock! I had an album that was due to come out in four months along with a lot of performance dates on the books. My dreams were coming true and I was thinking (in my scrappy hood speak), ""Um, I don't care if I'm dying, this album is coming out and I am going on tour before you cut on me, okay?? Or I will cut YOU!""

So what do I do?? I am now an adult. My health is in MY hands now. So, I called the University of KY department of pediatric cardiology to find Dr. Noonan. She agreed to come back in to see me so I drove to Kentucky. Can you imagine a",0.49346017927235475,0.7934601792723548,-0.30000000000000004,0.0

259375,False,1024,"The British people must be told the brutal truth about the damaging consequences of leaving the European Union, and not be duped into believing that they can ""keep all the goodies and forget about the costs"", the Polish minister in charge of EU policy says.

In an outspoken interview with the Observer, Rafał Trzaskowski, Poland's secretary of state for European affairs, who met David Cameron 10 days ago in Warsaw, says that if political leaders do not tell the people of the UK the facts in advance of the planned in/out referendum, many will vote to leave, unaware of the devastating consequences.

50 Conservative MPs ready to lead campaign for EU exit Read more

The minister, who reiterates his country's refusal to accept Cameron's central demand – that social benefits should be denied to all EU migrants for at least four years after arriving in the UK – says Britain would no longer be an important player, in Europe or the world, if it left the EU. He warns that the ability of British people to travel as freely as they do now, and to work and buy homes in other EU countries, would also be lost, and that UK businesses would suddenly face new problems, as the country would no longer be able to influence the rules of the internal market.

Trzaskowski, reflecting growing fears in the EU that the UK government is setting itself unrealistic targets for reform which British people are being led to believe are achievable, says all European leaders want Britain to stay in the EU, but not if it means undermining EU principles, such as the free movement of labour. ""No one in Europe says, 'We don't care, take it or leave it.' No, we say, 'Guys, OK, some of your fears are justified, some of your sensibilities should be taken into account, and some of your idiosyncrasies, even though for us they might seem strange. We should talk about it.' We do not say ship out. But there are certain red lines. We cannot start questioning the cornerstones of integration, because it will have far-reaching consequences.""

Asked whether he fears the British people might vote to leave, he says: ""It really depends on how the whole thing is depicted by British political parties to the British people – what kind of alternative is painted. If you say you can leave and still be part of the internal market, keep your [second] houses, that you will still be free to travel, that there will be no customs duties, and so on – but that you will not have to accept free movement of workers, and you will not pay into the EU budget, of course people will vote [to leave] … but this is simply not true.""

Trzaskowski adds: ""If Great Britain leaves, it will minimise its role. I am not trying to be patronising. I think we have to be frank with the British people when we talk about their future in the European Union. Many people in Europe want to be accommodating … but if the demands are too extreme, they are not going to be met.

""You cannot keep all the goodies and forget about the costs. Britain will still have to pay into the EU budget, just as the Swiss and Norwegians do. It would have no influence over the decisions yet it would have to subscribe to all the rules. London would not be that sexy a place for capital movement because it would have much looser links to Europe.""

German chancellor Angela Merkel suggested last week that her country would do all in its power to try to meet British demands during a wide-ranging renegotiation of its membership ahead of the referendum. But it is understood that Berlin also believes that the key British demand – to deny migrants who are in work the same social benefits as UK residents – would amount to a fundamental breach of EU law.

Cameron is now urging fellow European leaders to reach an outline deal on the UK's demands, which also include an opt-out from the EU commitment to ""ever-closer union"", by the end of this year, in time for the referendum to be held next year. Should he fail to secure reform on his terms, more than 50 Tory MPs are poised to lead the campaign for the UK to quit the EU. Former cabinet ministers Owen Paterson and John Redwood are among backers of the newly formed Conservatives for Britain (CfB) that will initially support the prime minister's bid to renegotiate terms of membership for the UK, according to the Sunday Telegraph.

Poland, whose economy has strengthened since it joined the EU in 2004, now sees itself as a central player in the union and is determined to defend the rights of the 700,000 Polish citizens in the UK, the vast majority of whom are in work.

Trzaskowski says that just because Cameron feels strengthened by his general election victory, Poland will not roll over. ""We cannot say simply that we sit around the table and you say, 'This is my manifesto and",0.07657084971996497,0.776570849719965,-0.7000000000000001,0.0

Diabetes mellitus is one of the most common metabolic disorders that causes micro- and macro-vascular complications. Because of additive effects of hyperglycaemia and hyperlipidaemia for cardiovascular diseases, lipid abnormalities should be evaluated in diabetes. As vitamin C is known for its beneficial effects on serum lipids and glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c), we evaluated the effect of different doses of vitamin C on blood glucose, serum lipids and serum insulin in individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus.

METHODS:

A total of 84 patients with type 2 diabetes referred to Yazd Diabetes Research Center, Iran, were included in the study. They received randomly either 500 mg or 1000 mg daily of vitamin C for six weeks. Fasting blood sugar (FBS), triglyceride (TG), total cholesterol (TC), low and high density lipoprotein (LDL, HDL), glycated haemoglobin HbA(Ic) and serum insulin were measured before and after vitamin C consumption and the results were analyzed.

RESULTS:

A significant decrease in FBS, TG, LDL, HbA1c and serum insulin was seen in the group supplemented with 1000 mg vitamin C. The dose of 500 mg vitamin C, however, did not produce any significant change in any of the parameters studied.

INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSION:

Our results indicate that daily consumption of 1000 mg supplementary vitamin C may be beneficial in decreasing blood glucose and lipids in patients with type 2 diabetes and thus reducing the risk of complications.",0.8228921744456847,0.8228921744456847,0.0,0.0
256177,True,896,"A nature trail leads away from the campgrounds in the center of Reston, Virginia's Lake Fairfax Park. (Fritz Hahn/The Washington Post)

Human beings love being outside — an estimated 8 billion visits are made annually to natural protected areas, a number that's larger than the total world population.

But could spending time in natural scenery also have larger implications for how we behave politically, or how we treat one another?

A new study suggests the answer is yes.

The paper, just out in the Journal of Environmental Psychology, is by psychologist John M. Zelenski and several other colleagues from Carleton University in Ottawa, Canada. In the study, the researchers wanted to test the idea that there's a link between actually experiencing the natural world, and behaving in a sustainable way. ""We hypothesize that participants exposed to nature will make more cooperative, and thus sustainable, choices,"" they wrote.

How do you study this idea? The research design was a series of experiments with college undergraduates, who, in the first of three studies, were asked to watch a 12 minute video. In some cases, it was a nature video — BBC's ""Planet Earth,"" no less. In others, it was a documentary about New York City's impressive — but also quintessentially urban — architecture.

Then the subjects played a game that the researchers called a ""fish-themed commons dilemma."" In the game, a group of people decide how many fish to catch over the course of a number of ""seasons."" Players receive 10 cents per fish caught (but it costs 5 cents to travel out to sea to catch them); the ocean initially contains 50 fish; and over seasons, fish regenerate at a fixed rate.

The participants were playing against other simulated fishermen who had been programmed to ""behave relatively cooperatively,"" rather than greedily (i.e., catching too many fish to maximize their profits, but ultimately crashing the fishery).

The results showed, sure enough, that those who had watched the nature video ""harvested significantly fewer fish per season."" And moreover, the virtual oceans in which they fished supported sustainable fishing for longer. In contrast, those who watched the architecture video harvested more fish early on, going for the money.

""By season 15, 49.09% of the architecture condition's oceans went extinct, compared to 28.57% in the Planet Earth condition,"" wrote the authors.

In several subsequent studies, meanwhile, the researchers modified the experimental conditions in order to test the strength of the results, a common practice in psychology studies. Thus, in another study, three different nature videos now showed a forest, a pack of wolves hunting, and a destructive flood. The architecture videos, meanwhile, showed an exciting Las Vegas scene and an old rundown house. Thus, people saw both pleasant and unpleasant images of nature and a built environment.

Even so, the nature focused videos once again had the effect of ""producing more pro-social responses"" in the fishing game. ""These effects do not depend on nature's pleasantness,"" noted the authors.

So why does viewing nature — as opposed to something constructed by humans — seem to have this effect? The authors say they don't know the exact mechanism, though they speculate that it has something to do with ""shifting people's preferences from immediate gratification to larger but more distant payoffs.""

The study also evokes E.O. Wilson's well-known biophilia hypothesis, which suggests that we have an evolutionary yearning to be in natural environments and among other creatures due simply to where we ultimately come from, back in deep time. The idea here, wrote the authors, is that ""we evolved in natural environments and, thus, they still support optimal human functioning.""

If nature exposure works to change our behavior and make us more cooperative, there could be considerable implications for environmental campaigns. Thus, the authors suggest that climate change advocates might consider using nature-focused messages, rather than economic or national security framings, to advance their cause. After all, global warming is ultimately an issue of the people of the world dumping too much of their waste into the atmospheric commons, and thus far failing to cooperate adequately on strategies for reduction.

The overall results, the paper concluded, also ""suggest that societies might consider investing more in nature.""",0.672870569925454,0.772870569925454,-0.1,0.0

More NFL: Photos | Videos & GIFs | Training Camp updates | Manziel watch

NFL fans with unrealistic expectations for their team might soon overtake 'college girls on spring break' as the most profitable customers in the tattoo industry.

Back in June, we wrote about a Lions fan who got a '2015 Super Bowl champs' tattoo on his leg. Now we have a Cowboys fan who thinks that Lions fan is wrong and to prove it, he got his own tattoo.

As you can see at the top of the page, this tattoo says the Cowboys will be '2015 World Champs.'

One of these guys is definitely going to regret getting his tattoo, but more likely, both of them will regret it. Any laser removal specialists reading may want to follow these guys on Twitter and give them a call in February after the Lions and Cowboys don't win the Super Bowl.

If Dallas doesn't win it all though this year, maybe our optimistic Cowboys fan can alter that '2015' to say '1995 World Champs' and then he can show off his tattoo to any fans old enough to remember Super Bowl XXX. Neil O'Donnell probably wouldn't approve, but who cares what Neil O'Donnell thinks.

By the way, the guy swears his Cowboys tattoo is real and he's even willing to pinky promise. He also thanked his tattoo artist after putting pictures of his new ink on Twitter.",0.7231519497755196,0.7231519497755196,0.0,0.0

259016,True,750,"Get used to Obama and Netanyahu not seeing eye to eye.

Don't be confused by the squirming disclaimers by U.S. spokespeople as they try every which way to quell the storm after anonymous senior officials called Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu ""chickenshit"" and various other invectives.

The denials from the White House and State Department sounded about as sincere as the semi-apology a few months ago by Defense Minister Moshe Ya'alon after he called U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry ""messianic and obsessive."" The crisis in ties between Israel and the United States is alive and well and here to stay.

Netanyahu is convinced that this latest attack against him originates in U.S. President Barack Obama's closest inner circle. But even if Obama's senior advisers didn't make those remarks, as White House officials insist, or even if the officials quoted by Jeffrey Goldberg in The Atlantic spoke without authorization, their words faithfully represent the Oval Office's attitude toward Netanyahu.

The expressions used by those U.S. officials to refer to the prime minister also recall harsh things that a long line of American presidents and cabinet members have said about Netanyahu over the past 20 years.

In an article a few years ago, senior U.S. diplomat Aaron David Miller mentioned that Secretary of State James Baker had boycotted Netanyahu when the latter was deputy foreign minister and temporarily banned him from the State Department. And President Bill Clinton walked out furious from his first meeting with Netanyahu in 1996, wondering if the Israeli prime minister thought his country was the superpower.

But why hark back to the distant past? The same Jeffrey Goldberg reported four years ago that then-Defense Secretary Robert Gates told Obama that Netanyahu was an ungrateful ally and that his policy on the Palestinian issue threatened Israel's future.

The U.S. officials behind the current attack were apparently trying to influence Israeli public opinion by revealing what the administration really thinks of Netanyahu; to signal to Israelis that their prime minister is seriously damaging strategic relations with the United States and endangering their national security.

But the insults and coarse language will produce the opposite, at least in the near term. Netanyahu, who believes he's already in an election campaign, took advantage of this incident to portray himself to Israelis as an innocent victim; someone being attacked simply because he's fighting to defend Israel's security interests and the Jewish people's holy places in Jerusalem.

Beyond the release of steam and expression of frustrations the White House has accumulated about Netanyahu over the past five years, the latest attack is a harbinger of how Washington will conduct policy toward the Netanyahu government after next week's congressional elections, during Obama's last two years office. The close security and intelligence cooperation will continue, but America's diplomatic defense of Israel at the United Nations and other international forums will not be immediate and obvious.

In the face of the diplomatic attack Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas plans to launch against Israel at the United Nations, the Americans will suffice with casting their veto in the Security Council. But regarding anything else, they'll let Abbas run amok as he pleases.

It will be the same regarding European initiatives for sanctions against the settlements. As far as the Americans are concerned, Netanyahu can lie in the bed he has made for himself.",0.7914547696709633,0.7914547696709633,0.0,0.0

A Swimmer is a type of Pokémon Trainer that first debuted in the Generation I games. Originally, the only Swimmers to appear in-game were male—Swimmer ♂ (Japanese: かいパンやろう Swimsuit Guy)—but in Generation II, female swimmers, Swimmer ♀ (Japanese: ビキニのおねえさん Bikini Lady) were introduced. Swimmers are found in the sea, usually just off the coast, and in some Gyms. From Generations II through V, they were formatted as Swimmer♂ and Swimmer♀.

When female Swimmers are paired with male Tubers in Double Battles, they are called Sis and Bros. Pairs of one male and one female Swimmer are known as Swimmers, while a pair of two female Swimmers is known as Swimmer Girls.

They specialize in Water-type Pokémon. In Generation VII, they keep their Pokémon in Dive Balls.

255222,True,894,"Sonic Boom officially welcomed the public to its brand-new space in the Robertson Building at 215 Spadina Ave. last month (and held a massive funeral party for its former Honest Ed's digs ). The change of address for the iconic record store, which has spent the last 13 years serving audiophiles in the Annex , with a newer location in Kensington Market , comes reluctantly after the sale of Mirvish Village forced them to vacate the lower portion of Honest Ed's . Thankfully, the big move hasn't wiped out the store's inventory or aesthetic.

Many frantic hours were spent prepping the new Boom for its grand opening on September 27. The space was most recently used as an American Apparel factory outlet , and while the staff already had their work cut out for them to exorcise the ghosts of improperly dyed metallic jeggings from the premises, an equally difficult task was combining inventory from two separate stores into one unified location.

As you may recall, Sonic Boom's original Bloor Street flagship was bigger than the one in Honest Ed's, hence the second branch in Kensington Market to house the overflow of vinyl and old-school paraphernalia. But with these new digs measuring a solid 13,000 square feet and centrally located on the southern edge of Chinatown, it made sense to bring everything together under one roof again.

Walking up Spadina's east side, I was immediately greeted by the storefront's expanse of large windows, one emblazoned with the distinctive orange and blue logo. These massive glass panes will soon be filled with Sonic Boom's signature window displays designed by Tim Oakley, but for now they let a flood of sunlight wash over the front room. High ceilings and exposed wooden beams make for a decidedly more urban-chic feel than previous iterations of the shop.

""The top floor is kind of a smaller representation of the store as a whole,"" says owner Jeff Barber. It has a little of everything, including new releases on CD and vinyl, audio accessories like Urbanears headphones and Crosley turntables, plus Herschel bags and other fashion accessories. The entirety of their book collection is shelved along the back-right wall, with a pretty replete catalogue of 33â…"" paperbacks that's tough not to geek out over.

The merch on this level is accented with a bit of quirky decor that'll be new to you unless you visited the Bathurst location during it's final days. The ""Captain Fantastic"" Elton John pinball machine is charming and totally makes sense in the midst of all this vintage music gear; the animatronic stuffed bear looming over a container of batteries may need to be explained to me, though.

Descending down the stairs at the back of the room leads me into the vastly bigger basement, which contains the bulk of the music selection. The rows-upon-rows of new and used stock will be totally recognizable to any previous Sonic Boom patron - every music genre is still well-represented here, though with particular emphasis on rock and indie.

A pretty sizable DVD and Blu-ray collection is starting to fill out the front half of the room, while display cases towards the back show off cool box-set and oddball collectables (for example: thanks to this setup, I now know that a Celine Dion/Anne Geddes collabo exists. Amazing).

That back end of the basement is where Sonic Boom will continue the tradition of in-store concerts, which in the past have featured the likes of Dinosaur Jr., Sloan, Aimee Mann and The Weakerthans , just to name a handful. The stage isn't set up yet, but the stack of guitar amps and mic stands against the wall are a sure enough sign of live tunes to come.

Leaving the Annex behind was surely a tough sell for both Sonic Boom's customers and crew, who've come to consider the store an integral part of the neighbourhood. But the new address' increased foot traffic, expanded space and close proximity to Queen and Spadina's many hip hangouts should ensure that not much will change for Toronto's largest independent music shop. ""We're sad to leave the Annex,"" Barber says, ""but we're excited about becoming a part of this neighbourhood.""

Two teenage girls suspected of plotting an attack against a Parisian concert hall have been arrested and presented to an anti-terrorism judge.

The Paris prosecutors office confirmed in a message to the Associated Press that the girls, aged 17 and 15, were arrested on Wednesday by counter-terrorism agents as part of an investigation for criminal conspiracy in connection with a terrorist enterprise that had been opened a day before. BFMTV channel first reported the news.

255165,True,513,"Ok, so this is a fairly short and not all too in-depth TL;DR this week for a couple of reasons. 1) If you watched our Music Monday on B.A.P.'s ""Power"" you'd remember that Martina lost her voice. It's still lost. Slowly coming back, but she sounds like a 439 year old witch whose lungs are made of dust. So, I had to do this TL;DR by myself. Also 2) I'm kinda sick. Not voice-losing sick, but coughing up randomly and uncontrollably. So, the less talking the better. Kinda can't do that when your only job is to talk on camera! Ah! So, like the shorter and easier Music Monday, we've got a shorter and easier TL;DR.

But it's good that I did this one on my own, because it's a question that's geared at me specifically, about being a tall guy in Korea, which Martina can't really answer. Though she did remember a lot of the things that I don't remember about being tall in Korea, like almost bumping my head on low-hanging signs. Some of these things you get so used to that you just don't think of anymore!

I definitely can say that I feel like Korea is a smaller country than Canada. Geographically, obviously, since Canada's the second biggest country in the world, but in terms of real estate and architecture: things in Korea are a lot more crammed, and so – being a big guy – I feel it a lot more than other people would, I think. Or maybe I don't? Maybe short people feel cramped more than I do? Maybe all of the people ricocheting off my body affect you more than it does me? I don't know. Sometimes I feel like flipping a car over to try to get some room.

Just in case you don't know where this is from, it's from long time ago when we did an episode of Star King with Super Junior. Super Junior, and everyone else for that matter, were quite short compared to us.

259322,True,750,"Russia said Thursday it has withdrawn its world-beating team of racewalkers from all international competitions to avoid ""disgrace"" in the wake of a series of doping allegations.

More than 25 Russian walkers have been punished for doping in recent years, with at least 20 of them trained by coach Viktor Chegin, who is under investigation by athletics' world governing body and the Russian anti-doping agency.

Chegin also announced his retirement Thursday, Russian media reported

Regional media in the city of Saransk, where Chegin serves as head coach of the national training center, reported that he had announced his retirement. He was not reported as giving a reason for his decision, but quoted by website Pro Gorod Saransk as saying that he hoped the investigation into his alleged involvement in doping would be ""objective and without pre-judgement'' and that he wished his team greater success in the future.

Since the start of last year, four Russian Olympic racewalking champions have received doping bans.

The Russian athletics federation said in a statement that it has withdrawn its walkers from competitions ""to avoid causing damage to the image of Russian athletics and Russian sport as a whole.""

The team will not compete until the Russian anti-doping agency finishes its investigation into Chegin, which was announced Wednesday.

That is ""99 percent"" likely to mean no Russian walkers will compete at next month's world athletics championships in Beijing, the federation's acting president Vadim Zelichenok told Russia's R-Sport agency. The only chance for them to compete will be if the investigation concludes very swiftly, he added.

""At the moment, there is the suspicion that this discipline [of athletes] could bring us disgrace at the world championships,"" Zelichenok said.

Zelichenok welcomed the news of Chegin's retirement.

""I heard he was supposed to make this statement. It's probably the only decision he could make in this situation,'' he told R-Sport. Zelichenok added that Chegin's national training center ""needs to be cleaned up'' but would not be closed. Two directors of the center, not including Chegin, have also been forced out in the past year because of doping bans.

Russia won two of the three walk events at the 2013 world athletics championships. One of those gold medalists, Elena Lashmanova, was banned for doping a year later but kept her world gold medal and the Olympic gold she won in 2012.

In January, three more Olympic-champion Russian walkers were banned, leading to the resignations of both the president of the Russian athletics federation and the head coach.

The federation said Thursday that its athletes have been instructed not to work with Chegin or they could face sanctions. It was not immediately clear what this would mean for Russia's national walking training center, which is named in Chegin's honor and where he is the head coach. The federation, which does not directly oversee the center, said it had requested he be suspended from his job there.

Earlier in the day, Russia swept the podium in the women's 10,000-meter walk at the European junior championships.

The Russian anti-doping agency said Wednesday that Chegin is suspected of having doping substances and either providing or attempting to provide them to unnamed athletes.

Both the World Anti-Doping Agency and track and field's world governing body, the International Association of Athletics Federations, are also investigating Russian athletics as a whole after a German TV documentary, broadcast in December, alleged doping was commonplace and organized by senior officials.",0.8101725372764795,0.8101725372764795,0.0,0.0

India, as seen through the eyes of three artists, two local and one from Mumbai, is the theme of the exhibition at the Parker Hill Branch Library in Mission Hill. The paintings, photographs and drawings that make up the exhibit are on view now through the end of February 2014.


Artist Maddu Huacuja planned to spend only two weeks in India. Invited to visit Rajasthan, she went with her daughter in 2005, and was captivated by the land and enthralled by the culture and people, and stayed six weeks instead. The magic of India also enchanted Lucilda Dassardo-Cooper who first went to India on a yoga retreat in 1994. She returned to live and travel in India for three years. Mumbai artist Jyoti Puri, exhibited her artwork in Washington, D.C. in the early nineties and it was here that Puri and Dassardo-Cooper met – introduced by the cultural attaché at the Indian embassy. The two found they had much in common and remain firm friends.


At a public reception at the library on January 23, from 5:00 – 7:00 pm, north Indian classical music will be performed by Philip Kaplan, who has been performing, composing and teaching music since graduating from the New England Conservatory of music in 1979. Kaplan plays his remarkable invention he calls ""the guitarod"" a modified electric guitar with a sound similar to the sarod, that has delighted and amazed audiences locally and internationally. He is accompanied on tabla, Indian drums, by Ajit Acharya who is based in New England and also studied in India. All are welcome to this evening of food, music and art of India, and to meet the performing and visual artists.


The Inspired by India exhibition was organized by the Community Exhibitions Initiative, a program of the Center for Arts and Community Partnerships (CACP) at the Massachusetts College of Art and Design. This initiative curates and installs ongoing exhibitions at three community sites in Mission Hill: the Parker Hill Branch Library, Butterfly Coffee and the Sparring Partner Exhibition Windows.

255394,False,1024,"Daniel Greenfield, a Shillman Journalism Fellow at the Freedom Center, is an investigative journalist and writer focusing on the radical left and Islamic terrorism.

Akayed Ullah, a Bangladeshi Muslim living in Brooklyn, really hated Christmas. He hated Christmas so much that he used Christmas tree lights (along with a battery and some wire) as a trigger for a pipe bomb. He filled the pipe bomb with screws so that when it went off, metal shrapnel would tear bloody holes through morning commuters in Manhattan.

Wearing a hooded jacket and a backpack to cover the pipe bomb strapped to his body, Ullah got on the F Train at the 18th Avenue elevated subway station off Little Bangladesh. Like the Duke Ellington song says, he switched over to the A Train at Jay Street. It was early morning, but there were plenty of people riding the train. Jay Street is a major transit hub. But Ullah was waiting to blow up somewhere else.

He got off in the crush at the 42nd-St. Port Authority station. Here a whole lot of people can be found rushing up and down crowded staircases and shoving their way through cramped corridors.

Ullah took the long underground corridor that runs between the Port Authority station and Times Square. He strode past movie and beauty ads. He walked under the discouraging poem, ""Overslept, So tired, If late, Get fired, Why bother? Why the pain? Just go home. Do it again."" But he wasn't going home. And there would be no opportunities to do it again. The Muslim terrorist was right on time.

Rush hour was just getting started in the city that never sleeps. The Muslim terrorist probably passed hundreds of people: not to mention a saxophonist or drummer trying out his act on tired commuters.

But he was waiting for something else. Finally he saw it. A Christmas poster.

That's when he detonated the pipe bomb using a Christmas tree light near a Christmas poster. Because if there was one thing that Akayed Ullah, like his ISIS masters truly hated, it was Christmas.

Last month, ISIS supporters had circulated a poorly photoshopped poster of Santa next to a box of dynamite overlooking Times Square. ""We meet at Christmas in New York... soon,"" it read.

As he walked toward Times Square, Ullah appeared determined to carry out the ISIS threat. Using a Christmas tree light in his bomb and detonating near a Christmas poster was a clear statement.

Ullah came to this country in 2011. Three years later, he had already been 'radicalized'. The Bangladeshi terrorist had come here on a chain migration link that began with a diversity lottery visa. But Ullah didn't actually like diversity. He didn't want to share a city or country with Christians.

And so he set out to kill them.

In Ullah's native Bangladesh, Christian churches have shut down midnight mass before due to threats of violence.

""This is the first time in my life that I find Christians celebrating Christmas with such panic and fear,"" the Bangladesh Christian Association secretary general had said.

But with the diversity visa lottery, you don't have to be a Christian living in Bangladesh to be terrorized by Bangladeshi Muslim violence.

And maybe that's a diversity we could do without.

That same year, Bangladeshi authorities stopped a Christmas Day plot that involves a suicide bomb vest. But this year, America had its very own Bangladeshi suicide bomber. Christians are readying to celebrate Christmas in Bangladeshi churches this year with metal detectors and thousands of security personnel.

But these days that's not just Christmas in Bangladesh. It's Christmas in Europe.

Muslim Christmas violence spread terror across Europe last year. These ranged from the 'Kindergarten bomber', a 12-year-old Iraqi who planted a nail bomb in a German Christmas market to the Tunisian refugee who rammed a truck into another German Christmas market killing 12 people and wounding 68. These days, German Christmas markets come with car barriers that are gift wrapped with bows.

An estimated 29 'lone wolves' were arrested last year in Christmas terror plots in the UK, France, Brussels and Australia. A number of these plots targeted Christmas markets, carnivals and cathedrals.

The year before, a Pakistani married couple had opened fire at a Christmas party at the Department of Public Health in San Bernardino. The worst half of the couple had groused about the Christmas decorations. Previous attack plots had included the Christmas Day bomber (the Nigerian terrorist also known as the underwear bomber) and Portland's Somali Christmas tree lighting bomb plot.

This is what a religious war looks like.

Muslim violence spikes around Ramadan, and around Christian and Jewish holidays, because Islamic violence is inherently religious in nature. Islamic Supremacist terrorists like Ullah are lashing out at non-Islamic religions in",0.0,0.7796836382614734,-1.0,0.0

259997,True,360,"Amazon Studios said today that Stephen Root has landed the title role in The Man in the High Castle, its adaptation of Philip K. Dick's alt-history novel about life in the former United States after the Allied Powers lost World War II.

He'll play the mysterious figure tied to the Resistance movement who collects the enigmatic films that seem to depict alternate versions of reality — the ones the Japanese and Nazis want to find and destroy. Watch a clip of his character above.

Season 2, which starts streaming December 16, picks up with political tensions mounting between Germany and Japan. Juliana Crain (Alexa Davalos) facing the consequences of her decision to betray the Resistance and allow Joe Blake (Luke Kleintank), a suspected Nazi agent, to escape the Pacific States with a film originally bound for the Man in the High Castle. Joe returns a hero to the Reich and finds himself thrust into the Nazi capital of Berlin, face to face with the father who abandoned him. Meanwhile, Frank Frink (Rupert Evans) becomes increasingly radicalized and drawn further into the Resistance after seeing images of his own execution in the mysterious films. DJ Qualls, Joel de la Fuente, Brennan Brown, Bella Heathcote, Callum Keith Rennie, Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa and Rufus Sewell co-star.

Veteran actor Root has appeared in dozens of films as Selma, Trumbo, Boardwalk Empire and Finding Dory and played Milton in the cult classic Office Space. His recent TV credits include Turn, Brooklyn Nine-Nine and voice roles in Adventure Time, Gravity Falls and Kung Fu Panda: Legends of Awesomeness.

256897,True,560,"Kurt bought this guitar from Chris Cobb of Real Guitars in San Francisco, CA. It is one of only two known 1960's Mark IV Gospels. The other is owned by Mosrite founder's daughter Michelle Moseley. A small number of these were reissued in Japan and usually sell on ebay for around $1000.
This is perhaps the most auctioned off Cobain guitar to date. The initial auction estimate was $75,000. It was initially auctioned on April 27, 2004 at the Dallas Guitar Show by Odyssey/Heritage Auctions. At the 2004 auction the closing price was $117,500. The second auction ended on April 14, 2006. The closing price was $131,450.
From the Press Release
""This instrument is unusual in a couple of ways. It is the only known example of a Mark IV style Mosrite Gospel model. While Kurt owned and smashed many cheap (usually Univox) copies of Mosrite guitars during his career, this was one of only two actual Mosrites he owned. (The other was damaged and given away.) It was also one of his favorite guitars, which saved it from the usual fate of the instruments he used for live performances. Kurt purchased the guitar in San Francisco in 1990. ""According to Earnie [Bailey], 'Kurt had only one Gospel, and this is a beyond rare guitar. At the time Kurt died, I was secretly working with Loretta Mosley to build Kurt a lefty Gospel... in some cool color.' Unfortunately, Kurt passed away as Earnie was gathering photos to send to Mosrite of Kurt's original. 'Loretta sent me a nice letter after it ended, as she had recently lost Semie (husband, founder of Mosrite) and was now running Mosrite on her own... she had sent me some sales literature of another Gospel, but could find no history of ever having made one based on the Mark IV guitar.'"" (Quote reprinted from www.kurtsequipment.com.) Kurt had painted the very small Mosrite dot markers with white-out to make them more visible in a live setting. Although the current owner removed this simple modification, residue is still visible on the instrument. This is a factory right handed instrument, so it was modified for Kurt with a strap button added to the treble side horn, and the original metal string guide has been flipped to allow it to be strung left handed. The original case bears the words 'NIRVANA' and 'Fuck Elvis' in white paint which, while painted over with the same white paint, are still visible on inspection. Est. 250,000-up.""

Tucked at the bottom of Amazon's press release for the new Fire TV Stick 2 are partial answers to both of those questions. Amazon says the new interface ""will be available for all Fire TV customers"" through an over-the-air update. Later this year, the Fire TV Stick 2 and the Fire TV 2 will receive the update first, and the Fire TV Stick 1 and Fire TV 1 will follow.

As for new features, apart from the complete interface overhaul, the press release says there will now be ""a customizable apps list on the home screen,"" which is a feature that so many of us Fire TV owners have been wanting for a long time. Amazon also says the new interface ""will present a cinematic experience"" and let ""customers access the content they want more quickly – without the need to open and close multiple apps."" I'm not entirely sure what that means, but my guess is they're referring to a tighter integration of Amazon Channels, which do let you view content from other networks through the Fire TV's default interface, instead of individual apps.

The central rally in the north of the Strip was reportedly attended by nearly 100,000.[1] The anniversary celebrations also included a large military parade by Hamas' military wing, the 'Izz Al-Din Al-Qassam Brigades.[2]

Senior Hamas officials who spoke at the marches and rallies stressed that the movement would never recognize the Zionist entity or be satisfied with a Palestinian state within the 1967 borders, and called for continuing on the path of resistance and jihad until all of Palestine, from the river to the sea, is liberated. Al-Qassam Brigades spokesman Abu 'Ubaida thanked Iran for providing Hamas with funds, weapons and missiles and thus helping it to build its army, with its many advanced units. He also declared that Hamas would soon bring about the release of Palestinian prisoners through prisoner-exchange deals.

At the same time, the speakers warned of an impending ""explosion"" if Gaza does not receive the recovery funds it was promised. They did not spare the Palestinian Authority (PA) and its leaders from their criticism, calling them ""traitors"" and urging the people of the West Bank to rise up against them.[3]

It should be noted that Hamas political bureau head Khaled Mash'al was conspicuous in his absence at the anniversary celebrations, whereas senior officials Mahmoud Al-Zahhar and Al-Qassam Brigades spokesman Abu 'Ubaida were conspicuously involved and publicly participating. A recorded speech by Mash'al was to be broadcast at a mass rally in Hebron, but this rally was canceled following intervention by the PA and Israeli security apparatuses.[4] A special interview with Mash'al on the occasion of the anniversary was posted on the website of Hamas' mouthpiece Al-Risalah.[5]

Mahmoud Al-Zahhar: Palestine Stretches From Egypt To Lebanon, And From Jordan To The Sea, We Will Establish Our Rule Over The West Bank

Speaking at a December 12 rally in Khan Younes, Hamas political bureau member Mahmoud Al-Zahhar said: ""Anyone who thinks that we will recognize the existence of the [Zionist] entity or the 1967 borders is deluded... Palestine stretches from the Egyptian border in the south to Lebanon in the north, and from Jordan in the east to the Mediterranean sea in the west, and we will never recognize anything less than this."" He added: ""If part of our land is liberated, we will establish our state in that part without relinquishing even an inch of the rest. Just as we liberated Gaza and established a genuine administration in it, [with] an army and security apparatuses that defend us, rather than the Israeli enemy [unlike those of the PA], we will do the same in the West Bank, as a prelude to attaining all of Palestine.""

Al-Zahhar called to grant freedom of action to the people in the West Bank, ""who invent means of resistance that the occupation never imagined, such as vehicular [attacks] and stabbings."" He also harshly attacked the PA and its president, accusing them of treason against the Palestinian people, saying: ""The West Bank is suffering from two conflicts: [a conflict] with the Israeli enemy, which is directing its weapons at its face, and [another conflict] with the PA, which is stabbing it in the back while purporting to govern Palestine... Al-Zahhar called on the people of the West Bank to ""get rid of the traitors first, so that we can get rid of the occupation."" He also urged Fatah ""to become real partners in the liberation of Palestine, and [steer] clear of [intra-Palestinian] squabbling.""[6]

258739,True,496,"The Cleveland Browns, San Francisco 49ers and New York Giants all hit the road this week as big underdogs at the sportsbooks hoping to earn their first wins of the season.

For the Browns and 49ers, that fact is not surprising at all. But when it comes to the Giants, oddsmakers and bettors alike could not have imagined that they would be sitting at 0-5 heading into Week 6. The other New York team – the Jets – were supposed to be battling Cleveland and San Francisco for the top overall pick in the 2018 NFL Draft.

Instead, though, injuries have made it a real possibility that the Giants could end up going 0-16. In fact, of the three winless teams, only the Browns have lower odds of finishing that way at +800 (bet $100 to win $800). New York's number is currently at +950, while San Francisco's is +1200 at sportsbooks monitored by OddsShark.com.

The odds of any team going 0-16 for the second time ever is +300, while the price on that not happening is still a strong favorite at -400 (bet $400 to $100). The 2008 Detroit Lions remain the only team in league history to go winless with a 16-game schedule.

Cleveland went 1-15 in 2016 and picked up its lone victory in Week 16 at home against the San Diego Chargers. This year, the best bet for the Browns might be beating the Chargers again on the road in Week 13, especially since Los Angeles does not really have any real home-field advantage since relocating to the StubHub Center in Carson.

The 49ers will host the Giants in Week 10 before their bye and play in a weaker division (NFC West), so maybe that is why their odds are not as low as the other two winless teams. San Francisco managed to pick up two wins in 2016, sweeping the Los Angeles Rams, and they nearly defeated them a fourth straight time earlier this season.

New York plays in arguably the league's toughest division (NFC East) and has a very difficult schedule the rest of the way. The Giants host the Rams in Week 9 after their bye before visiting the 49ers and might go winless if they lose both of those games. Last year, they won nine of their last 11 games after a 2-3 start and made the playoffs.",0.6157932364412378,0.7157932364412378,-0.1,0.0

259324,True,887,"Perceptions of Vulnerability and Changes in Behavior

About two-thirds of investigative journalists surveyed (64%) believe that the U.S. government has probably collected data about their phone calls, emails or online communications, and eight-in-ten believe that being a journalist increases the likelihood that their data will be collected. Those who report on national security, foreign affairs or the federal government are particularly likely to believe the government has already collected data about their electronic communications (71% say this is the case), according to a new survey of members of Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) – a nonprofit member organization for journalists – by the Pew Research Center in association with Columbia University's Tow Center for Digital Journalism.

Thus far, concerns about surveillance and hacking have mostly fallen short of keeping many journalists from pursuing a story or a source; Just 14% say that in the past 12 months, such concerns have kept them from pursuing a story or reaching out to a particular source, or have led them to consider leaving investigative journalism altogether.

Still, these concerns have led many of these journalists to alter their behavior in the past 12 months. Nearly half (49%) say they have at least somewhat changed the way they store or share sensitive documents, and 29% say the same of the way they communicate with other reporters, editors or producers.

And among the 454 respondents who identify as reporters, 38% say that in the past year they have at least somewhat changed the way they communicate with sources.

When it comes to external protection from digital threats like surveillance and hacking, these investigative journalists do not put much stock in their internet service providers (referred to as ISPs). Just 2% have ""a lot of confidence"" their ISP can protect their data from being accessed by unauthorized parties, while 71% have not much or no confidence at all.

News organizations get mixed reviews for their ability to protect the security of their employees' communications. Among those who work for news organizations (589 of the 671 journalists surveyed), half say their employer is not doing enough to protect journalists and their sources from surveillance and hacking, while about the same share (47%) says they are doing enough. Just 21% say their organization has taken steps or implemented policies in the past year to protect journalists and their sources, while 36% say their organization has not, and 42% do not know. About half (54%) report getting no formal training or instruction on electronic security issues from professional sources such as journalism associations, news organizations or journalism schools.

Still, other issues are more pressing for the profession than surveillance and hacking. When asked to rank four challenges facing journalists today, an overwhelming majority (88%) of journalists identify decreasing resources in newsrooms as their top concern. No other issue comes close. Following far behind are: legal action against journalists (5%), electronic surveillance by governments or corporations (4%) and hacking targeted at journalists or news organizations (1%). Furthermore, relatively few journalists (27%) have spent at least ""some time"" in the past 12 months researching how to improve their electronic security.

Overall, these data paint a complex picture in which investigative journalists on the whole feel vulnerable to surveillance and hacking, but not to the degree that most are changing their journalistic practices dramatically or investing energy into figuring out how to do so. And nearly all of those surveyed (97%) say that for today's journalists, the benefits of digital communication like email and cellphones outweigh the risks. Just 3% say the risks outweigh the benefits.

About This Survey

The analysis in this report is based on an online survey conducted from December 3-28, 2014, with a representative sample of 671 journalists who are members of Investigative Reporters and Editors, Inc.

257711,True,429,"A Muslim 'community leader' has criticised figures showing a fall in 'hate crime' cases in Lancashire, claiming that Muslims are living in ""fear"" in the wake of the Berlin terror attack.

Lancashire Council of Mosques chairman Abdul Hamid Qureshi argued Islamophobia is an ""increasing problem"", and that the figures don't mirror the reality of the situation for the religious community.

The statistics show that the number of hate crime reports has fallen in both Qureshi's own locality, East Lancashire, and the county as a whole since the June referendum in which Britain voted to leave the European Union (EU).

The declining number of reports fails to reflect Muslims suffering in the wake of Islamic terror attacks, the community leader told the Lancashire Telegraph asserting that Islamophobia is growing.

""I think the reason it is falling is because people still don't feel confident coming forward and the third party reporting helpline is still in its fairly early stages.

""But those figures don't reflect what is really going on, especially for Muslims. There is an atmosphere of fear of intimidation. That only gets worse when there are terrorist attacks. At the moment there is an increasing problem of Islamophobia, with women becoming an increasing target,"" Qureshi added.

Rises in reported hate crimes are presented in the media as evidence that Britain is in the grip of an ""epidemic of hate"", and are used by bodies like the UN and NGOs like Human Rights Watch to demand politicians keep quiet on issues such as immigration.

However, a key pillar of the UK government's strategy against hate crime is to raise the number of reports. Much of what is outlined in the ""plan for tackling hate crime"" is dedicated to furthering this goal, with the Home Office unveiling a whole host of measures which are being introduced ""with a view, ultimately, to increase reporting.""

The document states: ""[An] increase in recorded crime is welcome as it is likely to reflect improved police practice and victim confidence in coming forward to report crimes.""",0.7495305018036719,0.7495305018036719,0.0,0.0

AP Photo/Mikhail Metzel Donald Trump Jr's emails about his meeting with Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya reference ""the crown prosecutor of Russia,"" a position that does not exist in the country.

Donald Trump Jr. released Tuesday what he claims to be the full text of his emails with music publicist Rob Goldstone, who arranged his meeting with a Russian lawyer to allegedly receive damaging information on then-presidential candidate Hillary Clinton.

Gladstone works for Emin Aglarov, a Russian pop star whose family has ties to Russian President Vladimir Putin.

In one email, Goldstone tells Trump Jr. that ""the crown prosecutor of Russia"" met with the elder Aglarov and ""offered to provide the Trump campaign with some official documents and information that would incriminate Hillary and her dealings with Russia and would be very useful to your father.""

There's only one problem — there is no such thing as a ""crown prosecutor"" in Russia.

Goldstone may have been referring to the office of the prosecutor general, who heads Russia's judiciary system and is the highest ranking official in that government branch. Russia's prosecutor general is responsible for overseeing the country's court and legal system and supervising all the highest branches of the law.

The title is currently filled by Yury Yakovlevich Chaika, appointed to the role by Putin in 2006. Chaika has ties to Veselnitskaya and is a very high-level official in the Russian government, the New York Times reported on Tuesday.

""This is obviously very high level and sensitive information but is part of Russia and its government's support for Mr. Trump,"" Goldstone wrote in the email.

The United Kingdom has an official with a similar name to the crown prosecutor, the Crown Prosecution Service, which is headed by the attorney general. State prosecutors in the United Kingdom and other Commonwealth states are typically referred to as crown prosecutors.

Goldstone is originally from Manchester, England, which may explain why he referred to the ""crown prosecutor of Russia.""",0.7657693579038818,0.7657693579038818,0.0,0.0

Now, he plans on making the franchise pay up.

The Detroit News reports that Mohamad Bazzi, 32, saw a sign in the window of a Dearborn, Mich., Little Caesars on March 20 announcing it served halal pepperoni, meaning the food meets Islamic guidelines—the equivalent of being kosher in Judaism, explains the Detroit Free Press.

He says he ordered a pie that he began eating with his wife at home before they realized the pepperoni was not halal. Bazzi previously worked at a pizza shop and says he was able to see the difference, while his wife, a converted Muslim, tasted the difference having grown up eating pork.

According to court documents, the pair say they became sick and filed a police report three days later. Bazzi returned to the franchise in May and ordered another halal pepperoni pizza, which he claims again contained pork.

When he complained in a recorded conversation, the manager claimed he asked for a regular pepperoni pizza with a halal sticker on the box, which he denies.

""They have no regard for people's religious beliefs,"" says Bazzi's lawyer. ""This is a violation of the Muslim faith."" A rep for Little Caesars says they cannot comment on pending litigation, but are taking the claim ""very seriously."" Click On Detroit has photos of the franchise's signs advertising the halal option as well as Bazzi's receipts.

258599,False,1024,"Two questions have dogged me lately: If I could go back 18 years, would I raise my children in Louisiana? Would I still view this as a place that would nurture and educate them, offer opportunities for personal and financial growth and help my wife and me imbue in them the values important to us?

When my son and daughter were born, I believed the answer was yes. I had hope. Even three years ago, I still had faith in Louisiana, as I wrote in a column to young people who considered abandoning the state: ""Stay here, find like-minded people, organize them, expand your influence, demand change, but don't give up on this amazing, beautiful place. Its good people -- flawed as we might be -- are worth your efforts.""


When I wrote that, I believed Louisiana had brighter days. I hoped there was a small flame of desire to recreate something great here. I thought Louisiana's people wanted to redeem their state.

I was wrong.

Today, I ask only, ""Is this as good as it will ever be?"" The answer, I believe, is yes. It's not getting better and could get much worse.

For all its rich and diverse culture and abundant natural resources, Louisiana is the sick man of the United States. We're an economic basket case and a toxic waste pit of environmental neglect and misconduct.

We are the state most adept at missing opportunities and abusing and wasting our abundant natural resources.

Louisiana is my home in every way and, at 59, I cannot imagine living anywhere else. And yet it's time to admit this is a place with no visible promise and little hope. To pretend otherwise is to engage in delusional thinking. We must face facts.

I'm not saying everyone should give up and leave. I'm staying and fighting for our future. There is much work to do, and I believe I can make a difference. I suspect most of you feel the same. But if we're staying, we must be honest about Louisiana's deplorable condition and bleak future.

Blame our leaders, if you like. But the problem is us. On average, we aspire to mediocrity; we are happy with good enough. We live in a land of plenty but view the world from an attitude of scarcity.

We mask our state's profound illness and disease with colorful festivals and spicy food.

We tolerate -- sometimes celebrate -- our corrupt politicians. (Witness the recent outpouring of affection for disgraced former Gov. Edwin Edwards on his 90th birthday.)

Speaking of celebrations, nothing makes us happier than college football, which is our true religion. In the fall, we worship on Saturday nights in Tiger Stadium, the state's holy shrine. Meanwhile, what transpires across campus -- in the classrooms and lecture halls -- barely concerns us.

Our elected leaders sell their souls to big oil and the chemical industry. The first has spoiled our land, pillaged our resources and damaged our coast, while the other has poisoned our air and water.

We are 47th in environmental quality. Perhaps it's no coincidence we have the nation's highest cancer rate.

Almost a third of our children live in poverty, the third-highest rate in the nation. That's not changed for decades.

We have the seventh-lowest median household income and the third-highest unemployment rate. After decades of so-called ""reforms,"" we still have the worst public schools in the country. We've cut higher education funding more than almost every other state.

I could go on. We are first in almost everything that's bad and last (or near last) in almost everything that's good. In most cases, even mediocrity seems beyond our reach.

The experience of the last four decades should settle any question about whether Louisiana and its people will soon awaken from their coma of complacency. We know well the diseases of ignorance, poverty and pollution that afflict us -- and have accepted them as sad facts, not obscenities.

The question isn't whether there is much hope or aspiration left in Louisiana's people. There is not. The question, instead, is whether this is a place our promising young people should abandon as soon as possible.

So here's what I'll tell my children: If you want to stay, then regard Louisiana as a mission field. However, if you want a place that will enlarge your life, expand your horizons, offer new opportunities and challenge your thinking, you should look elsewhere.

Our insular, prehistoric ways will not soon spawn a dynamic, creative culture to revive our economy and attract bright young minds to study at our universities and, after graduation, remain here to build a vibrant state. Our people have said loud and clear over the decades that we do not desire such a state.

It's time to admit that Louisiana is sick and dying.

God's Final Word: His Son

1 In the past God spoke to our ancestors through the prophets at many times and in various ways, 2 but in these last days he has spoken to us by his Son, whom he appointed heir of all things, and through whom also he made the universe. 3 The Son is the radiance of God's glory and the exact representation of his being, sustaining all things by his powerful word.

""Your throne, O God, will last for ever and ever;

a scepter of justice will be the scepter of your kingdom.

9 You have loved righteousness and hated wickedness;

255021,False,1024,"The Wolf currently has the former Seminole as his RB33, but expect Dalvin Cook to get a gigantic bump in the rankings after taking advantage of Latavius Murray's absence during the first week of training camp. Cook is catching the eye of his teammates and coaches, and currently possesses workhorse potential in Minnesota.

A succession of poor decisions off the field, ball security issues on the field and a mediocre combine dropped the uber-talented Dalvin Cook all the way to pick No. 41 to the Minnesota Vikings — who let Vikings legend and seven-time All-Pro Adrian Peterson walk in free agency, while adding goal line hammer Latavius Murray in March.

After Christian McCaffrey came off the board, us at the Roto Street Journal were pleading for a team like the Bucs, Raiders or Packers to select Cook. Once the Vikings drafted Cook, the fantasy community broke out in a cold sweat. Minnesota does very little to help out their running backs: from their porous offensive line, to their up-and-down passing situation and blah-scheme, it's tough to be a running back for the purple and gold.

The Wolf was especially hurt by this combination, stating:

Cook landed in arguably the worst spot possible with Minnesota. Indeed, the talent is there, but that's about all he has working in his favor. The team dished out oodles of money for Latavius Murray, who will undoubtedly be involved, especially near the stripe. Additionally, the line is among the worst in football, and there's little else really threatening defenses or creating TD opportunities. Throw in a bland, vanilla scheme, and Cook will be relying on his own high-end abilities to produce any fantasy value in 2017.

Although Murray had the highest percentage of carries inside the 5-yard line last season (81.8 percent in Oakland), we didn't take the severity of his ankle injury into account before grading out Cook's situation. The reason why Murray took multiple free agent visits was to prove to teams in person that the bone spurs in his ankle were not serious, and the Vikings took the bait. The former Raider underwent surgery on his ankle a week after signing and was expected to be ready for the start of training camp.

Fast forward to the start of training camp, and Latavius Murray is still MIA. In fact, on July 31st, Murray put no timetable on his return and would only commit to the regular season. After missing the entire offseason program and the start of camp with his new team, a frustrated Murray stated that he's ""behind the 8-ball."" He went onto say, ""if I'm not healthy, there's no point in me being out there. If I'm not good out there, I can't help the team regardless.""

Meanwhile, the rookie running back is taking full advantage of his opportunity by taking the majority of the first team reps and he's caught the attention of his teammates and coaches.

""The first thing the veteran players I've talked to about him say is, 'This guy gets it.'"" coach Mike Zimmer explained after a practice. ""He understands protections, he works hard, they see how he interacts in the locker room, and that's part of it. And then, when you have a special player—like when we got [linebacker Anthony] Barr—they say, 'Hey, man, this guy is different than other guys.' ""That's kinda how he is. They see him out there on the field with the other guys, and it's like, 'There's something different about this guy, the way he runs, accelerates, the creases he can get to.' He's got a tough mentality. Players can see exceptional athletes. When they go out there and they're going against guys, they can see: This guy is pretty good.""

As one can see, it's safe to say that Dalvin Cook has earned the staff's trust, and with Murray still sidelined, he's truly entering a workhorse role. The cause for concern is still there, as he has a tendency to fumble, and once Murray joins the team, he's likely to vulture 7-10 touchdowns from the 5-foot-10, 210 lb rookie. The offensive line still sucks and the scheme is still as vanilla as can be, but with his elite pass catching skills, he could definitely see 250-plus touches. In fact, Vikings beat writer Matt Vensel of the Star Tribune said, ""don't rule out"" 300 touches for the rookie.

Cook will bring big-play ability (10 50-plus yard runs at Florida State), elite hands for a runner (79 receptions in three seasons) and every-down potential (766 touches in three seasons) to a Vikings team that desperately needs a legitimate playmaker. Don't forget about his blazing speed, which was on display when he dusted cornerback Xavier Rhodes — and his 4.4 40 speed — down the sidelines during",0.6996290690800337,0.6996290690800337,0.0,0.0

257937,False,1024,"[From Eugene Volokh: Following up on Professor Robert Natelson's series of posts last week on the Constitution's original meaning, here's one more, though dealing with qualifications for office rather than financial matters.]

Indeed, the argument is made that under originalism it would be unconstitutional to elect a woman as president or vice president because the Constitution refers to these officeholders as ""he,"" and the framers clearly intended that they be male. — Erwin Chemerinsky, Constitutional Law: Principles and Policies (3d ed. 2006) (citing Richard B. Saphire, Judicial Review in the Name of the Constitution, 8 U. Dayton L. Rev. 745, 796-97 (1983) Although I have not undertaken an independent analysis of this issue, it would be quite surprising to learn that the framers had a specific ""intention"" that women would be qualified for the presidency. — Richard B. Saphire, op. cit.

Although Professor Saphire's use of this issue was principally a way of elucidating problems in constitutional interpretation, Professor Chemerinsky's treatise cites his article as an illustration of what he calls ""The Basic Arguments for Nonoriginalism."" At a time in which there are highly creditable female candidates for president in both major political parties, perhaps it is time to address how the framers intended the Constitution to handle the issue. (By ""framers,"" I mean specifically the Constitution's drafters.)

At the outset, we should be clear that the Constitution's use of ""he"" and its variants to refer to the president is of little evidentiary weight, since during the Founding Era, as in all modern history before the 1970s, those words served as standard pronouns of indefinite gender. Of much more weight is other evidence that Professor Saphire would fine ""quite surprising,"" because it points firmly to the conclusion that the framers did indeed intend to allow women to be elected president.

In other words, just as the framers consciously omitted the religious tests for office-holding that appeared in all state constitutions and the racial tests that appeared in some, they also omitted the gender restrictions featured in nearly all.

For most of the state constitutions in force in 1787 contemplated that officeholders would be male. By way of illustration, the Virginia constitution provided for the election to the state Senate of ""the man who shall have the greatest number of votes in the whole district,"" and the New York constitution described the state legislature as consisting of ""two separate and distinct bodies of men."" Although it is true that contemporaneous usage encompassed a generic meaning of ""man"" to signify a human being, the context strongly suggests that these documents meant ""man"" in the narrower, male sense. The Virginia constitution's repeated use of the word ""man,"" for example, seems to have been interpreted in practice to limit voting to men. Other constitutions expressly limited voting to ""male inhabitants"" (New York, Massachusetts) or ""freemen"" (New Hampshire, Pennsylvania).

Contrasting with this approach was the New Jersey constitution. In that instrument, the words ""man"" and ""men"" nowhere appeared. It explicitly granted both suffrage and the right to hold office to ""all inhabitants"" who met certain property requirements, and it uniformly referred to officeholders as ""persons."" This was not empty form: In the real world, New Jersey women voted. In fact, they voted in sufficient numbers that New Jersey political operatives routinely included appeals for the female vote. See Judith Apter Klinghoffer & Lois Elks, ""The Petticoat Electors"": Women's Suffrage in New Jersey, 1776–1807, 12 J. Early Republic 159 (1992). The New Jersey constitution did resort to the pronoun ""he"" in describing officeholders, but the context shows the meaning to have been generic.

The framers of the federal Constitution sought to draft an instrument that would last for the ages. They certainly were aware of female voting in New Jersey, and they probably knew of sporadic female voting (in defiance of law) in states such as Massachusetts. Indeed, the trends of the time favored female political involvement generally — probably to a greater extent than half a century later. The historical records show women as active participants in the ratification debates on both sides of the issue. In addition to voting for convention delegates in New Jersey and perhaps elsewhere, women organized parties, parades and rallies, mostly for the federalist cause. Presumably both sides, but certainly federalists, made written appeals to women for political support. Mercy Otis Warren of Massachusetts, later a distinguished historian, contributed essays for the anti-federalist side.

For all the framers knew, the near future might bring female suffrage in states other than New Jersey. On such matters, the framers favored deferring to the states.

The records of the 1787 Constitutional Convention show that gender neutrality was the prevailing approach from the beginning, although",0.22038429286670924,0.7203842928667092,-0.5,0.0

259590,True,276,"Only a small percentage of the Cuban population currently has access to the internet, but that may be starting to change. According to the Union of Journalists of Cuba, the state-run telecom provider ETECSA plans to begin offering Wi-Fi service in Santiago de Cuba — the country's second largest city. That'll make accessing the internet somewhat easier for its residents, who typically have to use computers and connections at schools, offices, or government facilities. The fact that Wi-Fi will allow residents to connect phones and tablets should also be a big help, as those devices can be far less expensive than a traditional computer.

Even with Wi-Fi, internet access will still not be widely accessible. A fairly slow internet connection will reportedly cost $4.50 per hour — a prohibitively expensive price for many in a country where the average monthly income is just $20. That price apparently isn't even out of line with typical internet charges in the country, which may be double that or more in some locations. Still, accessible Wi-Fi will be a big change.

258558,True,849,"The British singer's aiming for No. 2 Billboard 200 next week, behind Lana Del Rey's likely No. 1

British singer Sam Smith and rock band Linkin Park are heading for the top of the Billboard 200 albums chart with their just-released albums -- though it looks like Lana Del Rey will block both acts from the No. 1 slot.

Industry sources forecast Del Rey's ""Ultraviolence"" (which -- like Smith and Linkin Park's efforts -- was released on June 17), could sell over 180,000 copies by the end of the tracking week on Sunday, June 22.

Lana Del Rey, Sam Smith, Jennifer Lopez, Linkin Park, deadmau5: Which New Album Are You Buying?

That should surpass the handsome bow of Smith's debut album, ""In the Lonely Hour,"" which might sell 150,000 to 160,000. It could arrive at No. 2.

Del Rey's major label debut, ""Born To Die,"" bowed and peaked at No. 2 with 77,000 sold in the week ending Feb. 5, 2012, according to Nielsen SoundScan. It surpassed 1 million in total U.S. sales in March, and its cumulative sum stands at 1.07 million.

The new Billboard 200 chart's top 10 will be announced on Wednesday, June 25.

Notably, while Smith has been heavily promoting his album this week with multiple appearances and performances on radio stations and TV shows (""The Late Show With David Letterman,"" ""Good Morning America""), Del Rey has been absent from the promotional circuit almost entirely. In fact, she hasn't performed on American TV in more than two years. Her last performance in the U.S. was on ""American Idol"" on March 22 of that year.

Lana Del Rey Blasts Interviewer Over 'I Wish I Was Dead' Quote

Meanwhile, Linkin Park is aiming to sell around 110,000 to 110,000 of its latest album, ""The Hunting Party."" The band's last studio effort, 2012's ""Living Things,"" debuted at No. 1 with 223,000.

""The Hunting Party"" will mark the first studio album from the band to miss the No. 1 slot since their first album, 2000's ""Hybrid Theory,"" peaked at No. 2 in 2002. All four of their studio releases since -- along with a mash-ups collaborations effort with Jay Z -- have hit No. 1.

If sales projections hold, this week will be the first this year to see three albums each sell in excess of 100,000 copies. It last happened in the holiday frame ending Dec. 29, 2013. (The last time it occurred when sales weren't goosed by the Christmas shopping season was the week ending Oct. 6, 2013.)

Sam Smith, 'In the Lonely Hour': Track-by-Track Album Review

After Del Rey, Smith and Linkin Park, look for country legend Willie Nelson to nab the fourth-largest debut on the chart. His new ""Band of Brothers"" album might sell around 35,000 or so, and should arrive in the top 10.

Jennifer Lopez will also debut with her latest, ""A.K.A.,"" selling perhaps 30,000. Deadmau5's ""while(1<2)"" could do 30,000 as well.

On SoundScan's Building chart (below), Del Rey, Smith, Linkin Park, deadmau5 and Lopez are Nos. 1-5, respectively. The Building tally is a precursor to the final Billboard 200 ranking -- reflecting the first four days (Monday through Thursday) of SoundScan's tracking week as reported by six major merchants.

As for the rest of the top 10 on the Building Chart: the soundtrack to ""Frozen"" is No. 6, Miranda Lambert's ""Platinum"" is No. 7 and the ""Now 50"" album is No. 8. Brantley Gilbert's ""Just As I Am"" holds down the No. 9 slot, while ""The Fault In Our Stars"" soundtrack is No. 10.",0.4724469516880046,0.6724469516880046,-0.2,0.0
255161,True,409,"While 13,255 refugees were admitted in August, that number plunged to just 2,070 in March. So far during the 2017 fiscal year, 45,732 people have been admitted, just a few thousand short of Mr. Trump's proposed cap.

Refugee groups now predict that entries into the United States could increase so rapidly that the total number of refugees admitted by Sept. 30, the end of the fiscal year, could exceed 70,000. That is well below the 84,994 refugees admitted in fiscal year 2016, but not by nearly as much as many advocates had feared.

Refugee advocates were delighted by the State Department's decision.

""This is long overdue, but we're very happy,"" said Mark Hetfield, president and chief executive of HIAS, an immigrant aid society.

But many of the advocates said they were worried that any reprieve would be temporary.

""The president's proposed budget cuts for 2018 would mean we would have a much smaller program next year no matter what happens with his executive orders,"" said Erol Kekic, executive director of the immigration and refugee program at Church World Service.

Perhaps even more worrisome, refugee advocates said they had seen a slowdown in security screenings by the Department of Homeland Security, whose checks are required for refugees to enter the United States.

Still, even Republicans in Congress have said that few of Mr. Trump's proposed budget cuts to foreign aid and the State Department's budget would be adopted into law.

In a visit this week to Syrian refugee camps in Turkey, Nikki R. Haley, the United Nations ambassador, all but urged Congress to reverse Mr. Trump's proposed cuts in aid to refugees.

""It's starting the conversation,"" Ms. Haley said of Mr. Trump's proposed budget, according to The Associated Press. ""It doesn't mean that's where it will end up. He's going to have that conversation with Congress on where we should fall on this.""",0.7722995563113013,0.7722995563113013,0.0,0.0

Few, to his surprise, had strange effects on his mind and body, seeming to carry him onto other worlds. We call these plants hallucinogens, because they distort the senses and usually produce hallucinations--experiences that depart from reality. Although most hallucinations are visual, they may also involve the senses of hearing, touch, smell, or taste--and occasionally several senses simultaneously...""

1 Schultes, The compounds that we call ""hallucinogenic"" are drugs that modify the function of the central nervous system by altering the input from the senses and changing the mood and behavior of the individual. These short term effects have caused some concern among our parents and leaders, but it is the long term influence that we will consider here. ""In the history of mankind, hallucinogens have probably been the most important of all the narcotics. Their fantastic effects made them sacred to primitive man and may even have been responsible for suggesting to him the idea of deity.""

2 Schultes, Dr. Richard Evan Schultes was no drug crazed hippy, but a respected Harvard professor with impeccable credentials. It was apparent to Dr. Schultes that hallucinogens were deeply involved in early religions. He also understood that to broadcast such views could be hazardous to one's career. Hence he confined his revolutionary discovery to one line in a popular guide to plant identification rather than publishing in some academic journal. When etymologist John Allegro went public with his discoveries linking early Christianity to hallucinogenic mushrooms, his career was ruined. It is indeed a subject that can cause deep emotional reaction. That was one of the early tipoffs that something important was going on here. There were such extreme reactions to inquiries about mushrooms that researchers had to come up with terms to describe mushroom haters and lovers. Whole cultures can be categorized by their view as to whether certain mushrooms are considered food or poison. Besides religion, the study involves ritual cannibalism, sex, and behavior modification. All of this is dangerous territory and may cause strong emotional reactions in the reader. If you DO have an emotional reaction to any of this material, you should sit very still, breath deeply and try to relax. Try to identify your feelings. Are you feeling anger? Frustration? Fear? Hatred? If these feelings are strong, you may want to quit reading. But please don't be mad at me. I'm just telling it like I see it. A certain amount of denial is necessary for survival in these troubling times. In order to function we all need a solid emotional state from which to operate. Like it or not, our basic beliefs, our ""World View"", is a major component of said state. Messing with your core beliefs can be tricky business. It hurts. It can cause damage; but so can ignoring the Truth. The trick is to use denial to keep your peace of mind, being careful not to be crushed by the Truth when it lands on you. Our beliefs are what holds us together. When the leaders we trust turn out to be liars, thieves and murders, it can shake our confidence and certainly be painful. The feeling of betrayal can lead to nearly uncontrollable anger. When our Gods betray us, it may be too much for some people to bear. Some folks might be better off if they just pass on this material and stick to their beliefs. Proceed at your own risk. However, if you are a seeker, and serious about ""meaning of life"" issues, you can't afford to turn back now. <- About | Next -> Sources

257514,False,1024,"Earlier this week I went to an entertaining talk by the writer Malcolm Gladwell, author of The Tipping Point, Blink and other bestsellers. Midway through he made a throwaway comment about the bombing of Hiroshima in August 1945. 'Imagine how it felt to be the pilot who dropped the bomb on Hiroshima – how do we feel about that kind of moral responsibility?' The implication of this rhetorical question was that the pilot must have been desperately wrestling with the ethical consequences and dilemmas of releasing the world's first atomic weapon on the unsuspecting city.

Malcolm Gladwell is mistaken. In actual fact, the US Air Force pilot, Paul Tibbets, experienced no profound moral quandaries about his actions, either before or after dropping the bomb that killed an estimated 140,000 people. In a revealing interview with the oral historian Studs Terkel in 2002, when aged 87, Tibbets described exactly what happened on the historic mission in the Enola Gay.

It was absolutely perfect. After we got the airplanes in formation I crawled into the tunnel and went back to tell the men, I said, ""You know what we're doing today?"" They said, ""Well, yeah, we're going on a bombing mission."" I said, ""Yeah, we're going on a bombing mission, but it's a little bit special."" My tailgunner, Bob Caron, was pretty alert. He said, ""Colonel, we wouldn't be playing with atoms today, would we?"" I said, ""Bob, you've got it just exactly right."" So I went back up in the front end and I told the navigator, bombardier, flight engineer, in turn. I said, ""OK, this is an atom bomb we're dropping."" They listened intently but I didn't see any change in their faces or anything else. Those guys were no idiots. We'd been fiddling round with the most peculiar-shaped things we'd ever seen.

So we're coming down. We get to that point where I say ""one second"" and by the time I'd got that second out of my mouth the airplane had lurched, because 10,000lbs had come out of the front. I'm in this turn now, tight as I can get it, that helps me hold my altitude and helps me hold my airspeed and everything else all the way round. When I level out, the nose is a little bit high and as I look up there the whole sky is lit up in the prettiest blues and pinks I've ever seen in my life. It was just great.

Tibbets tells the tale as if it were an exciting action movie. The tension builds, everyone's on alert, the timing is crucial – and the execution is perfect. A job well done. Terkel gave his interviewee the opportunity to explore the ethics of his actions, but received little response:

Studs Terkel: Do you ever have any second thoughts about the bomb?

Paul Tibbets: Second thoughts? No. Studs, look. Number one, I got into the air corps to defend the United States to the best of my ability. That's what I believe in and that's what I work for.

Ultimately Tibbets justified his action with the age-old reason that he was just following orders: 'I did what I was told'.

Terkel then asked him about his thoughts on the September 11 bombings, and how the US should respond to the threat of terrorism. His emphatic reply displayed the simplistic topography of his moral beliefs:

Paul Tibbets: We've got to get into a position where we can kill the bastards. None of this business of taking them to court, the hell with that. I wouldn't waste five seconds on them…

Paul Tibbets: Oh, I wouldn't hesitate if I had the choice. I'd wipe 'em out.

It is certainly worth reading the whole interview, which first appeared in The Guardian. I think the most remarkable aspect is that Tibbets seemed to display no empathy for the victims of the Hiroshima bombing. Flying up high in the sky, he never came into contact with the people he killed, or with the survivors. He never saw the burned skin, the charred bodies, the faces of the children wandering alone looking for their parents. His distance from the victims was essential to his empathetic denial.

What began as Danish designer Line Grüner's thesis project, recently got rolling as the Urban Green House, a rather stylish but functional mobile greenhouse on wheels developed and designed for the small space metropolitan dweller.

Although initially intended for her own use, the Urban Green House has attracted the attention of other green fingers, including institutions such as nursing homes, all whom desire a small greenhouse for their residents. Having picked up so much traction, Grüner's postponed her plans to become a teacher in order to pursue the entrepreneurial life.

She's's moving forward: Grüner's entered into an agreement with a Danish window manufacturer to produce the greenhouses, which she'll sell directly.

""Many said to me that it was possible to produce anything in Denmark. But for me it was important that the production take place in this country, explains Grüner. ""It should be a unified narrative, where we develop vegetables locally and then the product is not produced outside the country.""

Built of wood and a durable, UV-coated polycarbonate, the Urban Green House is a mobile oasis in the city, part growing space, part living space. Inside, the greenhouse is outfitted with an eye toward both gardening and socializing. A plant bed area can transform into comfortable seating for two, with a small storage area below to stash garden tools.

As its tagline ""Homegrown Anywhere"" suggests, the greenhouse's mobility is not only an asset for cramped city spaces, but also enables gardeners to chase the sun or move it out of the way to make room for guests or other activities. And like raised beds, the greenhouse eliminates dealing with the contaminated soil that often renders an urban space unusable for growing food.

""I could see that this whole urban farming concept was in motion,"" says Grüner. Even those living in the city, believes the 31-year-old entrepreneur, want to know where their food comes from and also have a fundamental need to get in touch with something green.

256117,False,1024,"Tooling was built and three full up prototype motors were constructed and tested. The first test was only to confirm the integrity of the motor casing, nozzle and top end closure. The second two tests were performed on a test stand to measure thrust with following results.

Static test #1 thrust curve


Static test #2 thrust curve

These curves were sectioned at deflection points along the curve and measured to which calibration factors were applied for time (x) and thrust (y) so that the performance of the motors could be computed. Analysis of the two curves is shown below.

Performance summary #2

Performance curve #2

There is good correlation between performances of the two motors. The burn time and total impulse were nearly equal for the two motors and peak thrust was within 5% of each other.

Compared to the model the actual thrust curves show a progressive burn and a longer than expected fall time for thrust.

Comparison between modeled and actual

The plot compares the model and actual performance curve #1. The total impulse or area under the simulation curve has been adjusted to 69 Newton-seconds to match the measured results of performance curve #1. Also since the simulation does not allow for ignition delay the simulation has been shifted +0.053 seconds so that the leading point of the model matches the first deflection point on the measured curve.

The triangular shape of the actual thrust curve, which is a characteristic of KNSB propellant, has been the subject of several investigations. One study suggest that gasses flowing through the core erodes the propellant from the core and produces a coning affect, which widens the core near the nozzle at a faster rate than at the top end of the grain. The expanding area of the cone produces a greater burn surface than what would be achieved if the core had remained cylindrical, thus increasing thrust at a faster rate. Once the conically expanding core reaches the OD of the grain at the nozzle, the core begins to shorten as the bottom end of the core moves upward toward the top of the motor causing a gradual tail off of thrust.

Another recent study suggests that the spacing between grain segments and the ignition difficulties of KNSB may be factors. It has been speculated that if the spacing between the segments is too tight, the flame spread created by the turbulence of the hot gasses flowing between the segments may not be capable of reaching and igniting all of the hard to ignite end surface. Incomplete ignition of the end surfaces would produce a progressive burn. Experiments by Richard Nakka have shown that increasing the gap between the segments to create a greater volume for the swirling gasses produces a thrust curve with good correlation to the simulated thrust curve.

The F motor as shown here has only minimal spacing between the segments and no primers were used to aid ignition. The igniter for these tests was a standard through the nozzle wire bridge igniter with black powder pyrogen.

The appendix to this article offers an explanation that suggests that neither of these hypotheses alone may be totally adequate to explain the triangular shaped thrust curve. Rather a combination of the two theories might be the best way to explain KNSB's odd characteristics.

Note: A too conservative propellant density factor was used when computing grain size based on a propellant weight. The actual propellant weights for the two prototype motors tested were 65.75 grams and 65.85 grams respectively. Since a propellant weight of 62.5 grams was the primary design goal, the grain was shortened in the final design to bring the total propellant weight closer to the design goal of 62.5 grams.

O-rings are classified by their ID, thickness and material. The O-rings used for this motor have an ID of 5/8"", a thickness of 3/32"" and are of a Buna-N material. The O-rings were purchased from allorings.com and are cataloged on their web page as -114 Buna-N O-rings selling for US$6.25 in quantity of 250. During the prototype testing of the three motors, no leakage was observed around the O-rings. This was confirmed by post mortem examination of the motor and by the fact that there was no premature ignition of the black powder ejection charge, which was part of the full-up test configuration of these motors.

The delay grain mix for the F motor is the same delay grain mix described in the construction of the G, H and I motors. The epoxy used in this mix is the same clear, 5-minute epoxy adhesive found in hardware stores, home centers and hobby shops and sold under several different brand names.

258691,True,663,"The National Park Service and the Coast Guard say they will hire contractors for positions typically filled by civilian employees, something a federal union says is illegal.

Both agencies say they are within their legal rights. Under federal law, agencies are prohibited from contracting out certain functions performed by civilian employees.

NPS and the Coast Guard maintain that the positions they seek to fill constitute new work and do not affect existing employees. The American Federation of Government Employees, which represents the civilian workforce at both agencies, called the plans ""illegal outsourcing"" of jobs that have been ""designated for performance by federal employees."" AFGE called on the Office of Management and Budget to weigh in on the debate and to issue governmentwide guidance clarifying agencies' responsibility to keep jobs in house.

The Coast Guard wants contractors to collect new user fees at its National Vessel Documentation Center in Falling Waters, W.Va. The subagency is largely fee funded, and due to a recent drop off in business it will soon add a new annual renewal user fee. The Coast Guard said it cannot use federal employees, who have historically collected all user fees, because of the Anti-Deficiency Act, which prohibits agencies from spending more money than they have been authorized to spend by Congress. It also stressed no current federal employees will lose their jobs because of the contract.

AFGE disagrees with that assessment.

""An annual renewal user fee is just another user fee, not new work,"" the union's National President J. David Cox wrote in a letter to OMB. He added, ""Why would the NVDC be able to spend money to pay contractors but not federal employees, whether permanent or temporary, to perform the same function?""

NPS also argued it could not afford new federal employees. The agency plans to contract out custodial and grounds-keeping work at the Independence National Historical Park in Philadelphia, Pa. In a letter to Rep. Bob Brady, D-Pa., who first contacted the agency about the positions, NPS said the contract will not impact any current employees and would give it ""budgetary and operational flexibility.""

""Our position is no federal employee lost their job because of the contract,"" said Jane Cowley, an NPS spokeswoman.

In a second letter to OMB, AFGE's Cox asked the Obama administration to ensure all custodial and grounds-keeping contracts that are ""inconsistent with the law"" are cancelled and the work is brought back in house. He added the NPS policy was an insult to AFGE itself.

""I consider NPS' sourcing and workforce management policies to be not just inconsistent with the law, not just anti-taxpayer, and not just anti-federal employee, but also profoundly anti-union,"" Cox wrote.

AFGE said the agencies did not provide the previously required cost-benefit analyses to back up the contracts, and the use of such a process is no longer legal in the cases anyway.

Smoked at: Cigar Jacks
I obtained this cigar via another Redditor like myself. It has a medium coloured wrapper, and a double band bearing both the name and the blend. After cutting the cigar with a V-cutter, I took a cold draw, and was both surprised and worried at how loose the draw was. I lit it with a triple torch lighter, toasting the foot nicely first. I was immediately met with sweet, almost hazelnut notes and a very nice mild spice. The ash was a nice white colour, and didn't seem at all flaky.
An inch and a half into this stick, the burn became uneven. I flipped it over to let the underside catch up, but it was no use. I had to even it up with a single torch lighter that one of the Jacks regulars had laying around. The mild spice had faded at that point into rich, much more spicy tobacco overtones with sweet coffee undertones. The ash held on for an inch and a half before falling off (albeit this was my fault, as I jostled the stick setting it down).
More than halfway through, the flavours started to change again. I love this about Rocky Patel cigars; generally, they are very fluid and changing throughout the length of the smoke. Very prominent oaky flavours are mingling with the hazelnut undertones now, and the spice is still quite strong and in your face. Unfortunately, the burn is quite uneven, even after touch-ups. I put the single torch to the uneven part once more. In the last two inches or so, it grew slightly hot, and I set it down to die.
Final verdict: very flavourful and changing stick (hazelnut, coffee, oak, spice) with nice ash and quite a few burn problems. Full bodied. Overall, a good stick, but not for every day. 84/100",0.47053216827017336,0.6705321682701734,-0.2,0.0
259862,True,667,"New mother Kelly Barnes is heartbroken and angry.

She's heartbroken because she has endured what no mother should have to endure. While pregnant with twins, she lost one of them at 30 weeks. The other baby, Kinsleigh, was born with serious heart problems.

But Barnes is angry because her insurance company, Aetna, held up paying thousands of dollars in medical charges. The reason? The insurance company said the newborn might have been suffering from a pre-existing condition.

""I don't know how something could be pre-existing in a baby, so it was very shocking to me to see something like that,"" Barnes told ""Good Morning America."" ""It's a slap in the face. Her medical bills are the last thing I should be worrying about. I should know that my baby is being taken care of.""

""Under Aetna's own definition, in order to deny for pre-existing condition, there has to be medical advice or care that was rendered or given,"" Barnes' attorney, Tom Caldwell, said. ""And in this case, of course, that would be real hard, given the fact the baby was still in the womb.""

Barnes said she called Aetna hoping for a resolution.

""It's like you're talking to somebody who is reading from a script,"" Barnes said. ""They don't have answers for you based on what you're telling them.""

Finally, Barnes contacted ""GMA."" We called the insurance company in September and they claim that the pre-existing condition hold up was a simple coding error and have been paying back Barnes' claims since July. But Barnes said that no one ever told her that and it wasn't until ""GMA"" got involved that all the costs were finally paid this week.

""It is my personal belief that they will -- they do this to you, expecting you not to follow up with it,"" she said. ""And I'm sure most people don't.""

Consumer expert Deann Friedholm said what Barnes experienced is not uncommon.

""It really might be a clerical error, but let's face it, it is in the company's interest to not pay bills. The fewer bills they pay, the better their bottom line is,"" Friedholm said.

Kinsleigh still needs heart operations, but those Aetna said they'll be paying for. Even so, Barnes said she'll never forget the nightmare that Aetna put her and her family through.

Following the ""GMA"" investigation, Aetna apologized to Barnes.

First photo of a person

Boulevard du Temple, Paris, 3. Arondissement is the first ever photograph of a human being. The daguerreotype was taken in Paris by Louis Daguerre (1787–1851), on a date that has been calculated as between 24 April and 4 May 1838. It is of a busy street, but because exposure time was over ten minutes, the city traffic was moving too much to appear. The exception is a man in the bottom left corner, who stood still getting his boots polished long enough to show. Less discernible, but also visible, is the boot black. As Geoffrey Batchen has noted, this is therefore also the first photo to illustrate both labour and class difference. See also Jenkins, who notes the possibility that there are one or two other people also discernible. Daguerre gave a triptych of daguerreotypes, of which this was one (with another of the same view, taken later in the day), to King Ludwig I of Bavaria, and they were displayed at the Arts Association in Munich from 20 October 1839. Eventually they came into the custody of the Fotomuseum in Munich, where in the 1970s an attempt at cleaning succeeded in erasing the images. The image as seen today is a reproduction of a photographic copy made by Beaumont Newhall, the historian of photography, in 1937. [History of Art: History of Photography] NB Although the strongest evidence supports this image, an interesting case has been made for a daguerreotype image made by Daguerre and Mathurin-Joseph Fordos, of the Pont Neuf in Paris, and now preserved in the Musée des Arts et Métiers. It's argued that this could actually date from the summer of 1837, but at any event prior to the Boulevard du Temple image. See Gunthert, or the same page translated.

First portrait photo of a person

According to John Johnson (1813–1871), the first daguerreotype portrait was of himself, made in New York by Alexander S. Wolcott (1804–1844) on 6 or 7 October 1839. This was tiny, and has not survived. (Hannavy) However, Howard R. McManus has convincingly argued that John William Draper (1811–1882), professor of chemistry at the University of New York, accomplished successful portrait daguerreotypes as early as 23 September 1839, the first such being of his assistant William Henry Goode, taken in the university chapel. (McManus—First) Draper's daguerreotype of Goode is said to have still been in existence in 1890. (Eder) McManus includes an image of a flawed daguerreotype plate (from his own collection), in which the subject is very difficult to make out, but which he speculates may in fact be an experimental portrait photograph of William Henry Goode, from 22 or 23 September 1839. Generally accepted as the earliest surviving photographic portrait image of a human ever produced is the approximately quarter plate daguerreotype by Robert Cornelius [1809–1893], a head-and-shoulders [self-]portrait, facing front, with arms crossed (above), dating from 1839 [Oct. or Nov.]. [LC-USZC4-5001 DLC]. Written on the paper backing is ""The first light picture ever taken. 1839."" The photograph, now at the Library of Congress in Washington DC, was taken outside his place of business on 8th Street between Market and Chestnut, in Philadelphia. The Cornelius daguerreotype is not uncontested as the earliest surviving photographic portrait. Another strong contender is the self-portrait of the Baltimore daguerreotypist Henry Fitz (1808–1863), now held by the Smithsonian, which also dates from late 1839. This is reproduced in Newhall, and in Wikimedia Commons. NB An interesting argument has been made for an earlier candidate than any of these, a daguerreotype portrait of a M. Huet, apparently by Daguerre himself, and dated 1837 on the back. This image is in the collection of Marc Pagneux. It does seem established that Daguerre was experimenting with portraits in 1837, and the portrait could be one such. See Gunthert, or the same page translated; and Gunthert & Roquencourt, (translated); and Wood.

256613,False,1024,"The CIA Hoax Report

by Barry Chamish

A phony CIA report on Israel is being distributed by a notoriously iffy Canadian website. The problem is its conclusions may be right for all the wrong reasons. We'll dive into those reasons as soon as we divest ourselves of this purported ""study.""

http://www.globalresearch.ca/cia-report-israel-will-fall-in-20-years/12706

The report begins with the cliche of Israel being a colonial ""Apartheid"" state which will be destroyed when millions of Palestinians all decide to move back there. I will dismiss this observation with the endlessly quoted tourists of the 19th century like Twain and Balzac who reported an empty Palestine where the Jews were the majority in centers like Jerusalem, Tsfat and Tiberius. The British takeover in 1917 attracted a new population of ""ancient"" Palestinians attracted by jobs. If you want to talk colonial takeover, start with the Hashemite dynasty moved by the British from Mecca to Jordan a generation before there was an Israel.

A study conducted by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) has cast doubt over Israel's survival beyond the next 20 years.The CIA report predicts an inexorable movement away from a two-state to a one-state solution, as the most viable model based on democratic principles of full equality that sheds the looming specter of colonial Apartheid while allowing for the return of the 1947/1948 and 1967 refugees. The latter being the precondition for sustainable peace in the region.

In short, the CIA, if it claims to be professional, would never have written such a silly introduction. This is a classic far left cliche. But the misinformation gets even sillier.

The study, which has been made available only to a certain number of individuals, further forecasts the return of all Palestinian refugees to the occupied territories, and the exodus of two million Israelis who would move to the US in the next fifteen years. There is over 500,000 Israelis with American passports and more than 300,000 living in the area of just California, International lawyer Franklin Lamb said in an interview with Press TV on Friday, adding that those who do not have American or western passport, have already applied for them.

We begin with the accurate fact that half a million Israelis boast American passports. Then the baloney. According to this hoax, ALL other Israelis have already applied for their passports. In other words, EVERYONE is getting ready to leave. This is not according to the alleged CIA report but is citation from a lawyer no one has heard of commenting on this dumb hoax. This leads to the inevitable conclusion that Israel is not going the way of South Africa or the Soviet Union, which kept their ""colonial"" populations, but to an even more appealing end where all the Jews leave.

""So I think the handwriting at least among the public in Israel is on the wall [which] suggests history will reject the colonial enterprise sooner or later,"" Lamb stressed. He said CIA, in its report, alludes to the unexpectedly quick fall of the apartheid government in South Africa and recalls the disintegration of the Soviet Union in the early 1990s, suggesting the end to the dream of an Israeli land would happen way sooner than later. The study further predicts the return of over one and a half million Israelis to Russia and other parts of Europe, and denotes a decline in Israeli births whereas a rise in the Palestinian population.Lamb said given the Israeli conduct toward the Palestinians and the Gaza strip in particular, the American public which has been voicing its protest against Tel Aviv's measures in the last 25 years may not take it anymore. Some members of the US Senate Intelligence Committee have been informed of the report.

The shoddiness of this rumor cum ""report"" is the ""fact"" that members of the Senate Intelligence Committee have been granted access to it. Name one such member. If you claim it, you have to prove it. I lived in Israel for 31 years, knew many Russians and can assure you, not a one, let alone a million and a half, will ever return to Russia. And every demographer for the past decade has noted that the Palestinian birth rate has plummeted to below the Jewish rate.

We can safely assume that CIA intelligence has helped shove suicidal peace agreements down Israel's throat. It guided Pres. Carter to force Israel to give up the Sinai for peace. Today, all the years of peace talk are mere memories. No Israeli is crazy enough to visit there today. Armed terrorists have taken over the place. In 1993, Pres. George Bush forced Yitzhak Rabin to begin the Oslo peace, the result of which is Israel being bombarded with deadly missile attacks to this day with no end in sight. The Israeli Right knew precisely what the surrender of Sinai, Gaza, and the West Bank would wrought and we can only assume the CIA knew precisely the mess ""peace"" would cause Israel.

Everything about the G3 screams ''refined.'' Let's take a visual walk through the major new software features of the LG G3. There's a lot of screen shots, so get comfortable! [Update: software features video added.]

Note: the LG G3 given to media is a pre-production Korean version with non-final software, so there may be some changes in the final version. As such, I won't go on much about things that are ''missing,'' as they may return.

Optimus UI

The first thing you notice upon looking at the G3 running Android 4.4.2 is the new look Optimus UI. Previously, LG had tended towards a childish, blocky interface, but the new UI is clean, crisp and uses ''mature and sophisticated'' colors, avoiding vivid colors and clashes. The home screen is spacious with new circular and square app icons which look pretty tidy. Except the camera icon which looks like a clothes dryer.

LGHealth plays a central role in LG's new-look interface and is also clean and crisp. / © AndroidPIT

The notifications shade is like a mixture between iOS and Samsung's riffing on Windows Phone in their new TouchWiz interface, but to my mind, it looks a whole lot better than both. You can access all the familiar Quick Settings and bring up your QSlide app row. There's also a dedicated brightness and volume slider. LG's major apps have all been given a color-coded identity to ''enhance task awareness'' and LGHealth occupies a prominent position in the same way as SHealth on the Galaxy S5.

LG has opted for flip animations between screens and for circular and square icons. / © AndroidPIT

The app drawer is nice and clean too and doesn't feel too cluttered, with tabulated apps and widgets and a transparent background. The settings menu comes in a tabulated form by default but this can be switched to the easier to navigate list view. The old menu button has been replaced by the now default recent apps button and you can bring up your home and lock screen settings, as well as app, theme and widget shortcuts with a long press. Dual Window apps can be accessed with a long press of the back arrow. Long pressing the home key gets you Google Now.

Software features

Some familiar software features reappear in the G3, like Knock On to access your clock and notifications and Knock Code to directly access your home screen (or enter Guest Mode, where only five pre-selected apps can be accessed). There's also some motion gestures, mostly related to flipping the phone, facing t down or picking it up for answering and rejecting calls and so on. The volume keys on the back are still shortcuts for the camera and QMemo+, which lets you write on top of any screen and save or share the results.

Knock Code can be used to provide direct access to your home screen and Guest Mode. / © AndroidPIT

You can even get friendly reminders to dress appropriately according to the weather forecast and suggestions on accessories and upgrade promotions for a new device.

Whether it's Mango copying Gucci's silk dresses, Nasty Gal copying Saint Laurent's platform sandals, designer's copying other designers, artists or, as was most recently the case, the designs of indigenous cultures and tribes. Last week, London-based fashion label KTZ were in hot water over the ""Shaman Towelling Sweatshirt"" featured in their AW15 collection – a design which Salome Awa says was copied from her great-grandfather Aua, one of the last Shaman of the Canadian Inuit.

""They must have seen it and copied it,"" Awa told The Evening Standard, ""They even called the clothing Shaman... My great-grandfather was a very powerful and respected man and he has been used and violated. It was disgusting to see a sacred design used as a sweater... We are a proud people and our ancestors and traditions are very important to us. The way they have taken and degraded this design is unacceptable."" The design itself featured in 2006 film The Journals of Knud Rasmussen as well as some books on the culture of the Inuit such as ""Northern Voices"".

In response KTZ, who show at London Fashion Week, have issued a formal apology to Awa saying the brand has ""always been inspired by and paid homage to indigenous cultures and tribes around the world"" and that it's part of their DNA to ""celebrate multiculturalism as a form of art and to encourage appreciation for traditions, ethnicities and religions' diversity"". As well as emphasising the multiculturalism of their company, they said that the Inuit community was credited in the press release and that they have already removed the item from sale.

Awa's response to the apology was bittersweet, telling CBC North, """"I'm kind of happy about it but sad at the same time... They didn't even mention an apology to my great-grandfather and they didn't even offer any monetary gains to our family... This is a stolen piece. There is no way that this fashion designer could have thought of this exact duplicate by himself."" Awa goes on to say that she has some questions from the brand. ""Why did you not ask us in the first place?"" she asks. ""How they obtained the exact replica? Why did they not ask our family? Did they not think we exist? Why are they doing this to other indigenous clothing?""

Enlarge this image toggle caption Don Ryan/AP Don Ryan/AP

Congress' official scorekeeper says repealing Obamacare would increase the federal budget deficit and the number of uninsured Americans by 24 million.

The report from the Congressional Budget Office comes as Washington awaits a ruling by the Supreme Court that could end insurance subsidies for some six million people in 30 states.

The report says repealing the Affordable Care Act's spending cuts and tax increases would add $137 billion to the deficit over the next ten years, and the number of people with health insurance would drop from 90 percent of the population to 82 percent.

The CBO says economic growth would be boosted a bit because more people would join the labor force, as the Affordable Care Act's subsidies make it easier for people to work less or stop working and not lose health coverage.

Reaction to the report, as with most things about the health care law, fell along party lines. The chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, Republican Mike Enzi of Wyoming, chose to focus on how repeal would effect economic growth:

""'CBO has determined what many in Congress have known all along,' said Chairman Enzi. 'This law acts as an anchor on our economy by dragging down employment and reducing labor force participation. As a result, the deficit reduction that the Democrats promised when it was enacted is substantially unclear.'""

Democrats put their focus on the negative impacts of repeal. House Minority leader Nancy Pelosi said:

""The cost to the deficit would be surpassed only by the human toll of repeal. Republicans would add over 20 million Americans to the ranks of the uninsured, and strip vital health protections from hundreds of millions of American families – shattering the newfound health security that has made a difference in the lives of so many families. Republicans should look at the numbers and finally end their fixation with repealing this historic law.""

The new CBO report incorporates the principles of dynamic scoring, which takes into account a wider array of economic factors, and which Republicans say provides a more realistic picture of the economic impact of repeal. The CBO says under the old rules, the deficit would increase even more, by $353 billion over ten years.

Politico says the CBO report could have political implications:

""The estimate will make it harder for Republicans to use so-called reconciliation to repeal the law because congressional budgeting rules bar lawmakers from using the parliamentary maneuver to move legislation that adds to government red ink.

The CBO report said over the long term, repeal would add even more to the deficit:",0.706366406467705,0.806366406467705,-0.1,0.0

258682,True,675,"The ExoWorlds

The ExoWorlds list of exoplanets and their host stars being available for public naming at the initiative of the IAU is a list compiled from several exoplanet databases, including exoplanet.eu [2] and exoplanets.org [3].

This list includes well-studied exoplanets discovered over twenty years, up to 31 December 2008. A period of at least five years since the discovery has been considered as a simple and satisfactory criterion to include exoplanets which can be considered as confirmed. All the discoveries were made using various methods, including radial velocities, transits, microlensing and direct imagery.

For these exoplanets, the scientific nomenclature follows the nomenclature rules widely adopted by the scientific community, which are drawn from the rules for naming binary stars. For each planet, the name of the host star (around which planets are orbiting) is followed by a lower-case letter: b for the first discovered exoplanet, c for the second, etc. (The letters are capitalized in the case of binaries: the ""primary"" star name is followed by ""A"", and its companion stars are labelled by the same name followed by ""B"", ""C"", etc.).

In the ExoWorlds list, five stars already have common names: Fomalhaut (alpha Piscis Austrini) is one of the four ""royal stars"" of ancient Persia, with Aldebaran, Antares, and Regulus; Pollux (beta Geminorum) is the twin brother of Castor, son of Zeus (Jupiter) and Leda, from the ancient Greek and Roman mythologies — the constellation Gemini is named after them (Gemini means twins in latin). Three other stars also have common names: gamma Cephei (Errai, Arabic for shepherd), epsilon Tauri (Ain, Arabic for the bull's eye) and iota Draconis (Edasich, Arabic also). These stars have common names as well in other cultures [1].

Consequently these five stars cannot be considered for public naming.

255623,False,1024,"Conference realignment may have kept North Dakota off Wisconsin's schedule this season, but fate had other plans. The two former WCHA rivals are set to match up in the first round of the NCAA playoffs on Friday, which certainly adds to this weekend's excitement.

UW is the top seed at the Midwest regional in Cincinnati, Ohio., this weekend, while North Dakota checks in as the No. 4. The other side of the regional has 2nd-seeded Ferris State taking on Colgate.

In a curious twist of fate, it was the Badgers who allowed UND into the NCAA tournament. Had UW not beaten Ohio State in the Big Ten championship game last Saturday, North Dakota would not have earned an at-large berth into this weekend's NCAA tournament.

""It's almost as if the hockey gods made sure it happened this year that we were going to play them,"" Wisconsin junior defenseman Jake McCabe said. ""Obviously they are huge rivals. They play very similar to us, they're hard to play against and it'll be a fun one.""

Despite not playing against each other this season, Wisconsin and UND are very familiar with each other, which should take the ""feeling out"" process out of the early stages of Friday's NCAA quarterfinal match up.

""There's a rich history of great games and key moments,"" UW head coach Mike Eaves said. ""Coming to the regional where you usually have an unknown opponent, this time we have history with our opponent. Both teams will be able to jump into the deep end and just play.

""Usually, you got to go in and spar and see what things they do. Both teams will be able to play full-on.""

The Badgers are back in the NCAA tournament for the second season in a row, and are hoping to use the experience they gained last season in a loss vs. UMass-Lowell to help them in this tournament.

""Last year caught us by surprise a little bit and it was something we weren't ready for,"" senior center Jefferson Dahl said. ""The way our team has carried ourselves this year has prepared us for this regional.""

The Badgers enter the weekend as the top seed in the regional, and rightfully so according to North Dakota head coach Dave Hakstol.

""We're an underdog in this game against a really good, veteran team,"" Hakstol said. ""But we have the opportunity to play (Friday), and that's exciting for our group of guys within our locker room. And it's a fairly confident, loose bunch within our locker room.""

Wisconsin offense

The Badgers' depth is readily apparent within their top two lines that feature four seniors and a couple underclassmen who have been playing some of the best hockey of their Wisconsin careers of late.

UW's top group, which is centered by Mark Zengerle, was a major factor when Wisconsin won the Big Ten championship last weekend in St. Paul. Zengerle scored the game winning goal in overtime during the title game, and Tyler Barnes notched the game-tying goal late in the third period. The underclassman of the group, Nic Kerdiles, had three assists in the championship game and has 20 points in his last nine games.

What makes the Badgers so dangerous is the ability to create offense with their second wave as well. Michael Mersch ranks seventh in the country in goals this season with 22, and helped Wisconsin advance to last weekend's title game with two goals in the semifinals in a 2-1 win over Penn State.

Mersch's line, which also features center Jefferson Dahl and left-winger Morgan Zulinick was strong all weekend in St. Paul. Dahl helped set up the game winning goal on Friday, and notched a crucial goal of his own to help lead the comeback on Saturday. Zulinick had a power play goal in the championship, and was as strong on the forecheck last weekend as he's ever been in a Wisconsin sweater.

Wisconsin defense and goaltenders

Everything on UW's back-end starts with Joel Rumpel between the pipes. If the Badgers are going to make a run at championship No. 7, Rumpel has to play at an elite level. Fortunately for Wisconsin, the Swift Current, Saskatchewan native has that ability.

Rumpel wasn't outstanding for the Badgers at the Big Ten tournament, but he stepped up when they needed him most. The junior netminder has taken his game to another level this season, and UW needs all that and more from him this weekend in Cincinnati.

One player I thought had an outstanding weekend in St. Paul was Kevin Schulze. He's rarely talked about because he doesn't put up huge point totals, but the sophomore blueliner continues to impress every time he's on the ice. Schulze is the best skater on the",0.0,0.7316882595159981,-0.9,0.0

This page is about the ACPI DSDT (Differentiated System Description Table) It describes how the APIC works.

DSDT

Introduction

This page or section is a stub. You can help the wiki by accurately contributing to it.

DSDT stands for Differentiated System Description Table. It Is a major ACPI table and is used to describe what peripherals the machine has. Also holds information on PCI IRQ mappings and power management. For example when powering down by the OS, it should find the _S5 object which describes how to do that. It is pointed to by the FADT

How hardware manufacturers generate it

You can use an ASL (ACPI Source Language) compiler to generate DSDT AML (ACPI Machine Language) bytecode from a C-like language. To get an idea, take a glimpse on Bochs source:

bios/acpi-dsdt.dsl for human readable source

bios/acpi-dsdt.hex for hex dump of the bytecode output

For example here's the description of the Real Time Clock:

/* PIIX3 ISA bridge */ Device ( ISA ) { Name ( _ADR , 0x00010000 ) /* PIIX PCI to ISA irq remapping */ OperationRegion ( P40C , PCI_Config , 0x60 , 0x04 ) /* Real-time clock */ Device ( RTC ) { Name ( _HID , EisaId ( ""PNP0B00"" ) ) Name ( _CRS , ResourceTemplate ( ) { IO ( Decode16 , 0x0070 , 0x0070 , 0x10 , 0x02 ) IRQNoFlags ( ) { 8 } IO ( Decode16 , 0x0072 , 0x0072 , 0x02 , 0x06 ) } ) }

and what's it became after compilation:

0x00,0xA4,0x00,0x5B,0x82,0x42,0x23,0x49, /* 00000270 ""...[.B#I"" */ 0x53,0x41,0x5F,0x08,0x5F,0x41,0x44,0x52, /* 00000278 ""SA_._ADR"" */ 0x0C,0x00,0x00,0x01,0x00,0x5B,0x80,0x50, /* 00000280 "".....[.P"" */ 0x34,0x30,0x43,0x02,0x0A,0x60,0x0A,0x04, /* 00000288 ""40C..`.."" */ 0x5B,0x82,0x2D,0x52,0x54,0x43,0x5F,0x08, /* 00000290 ""[.-RTC_."" */ 0x5F,0x48,0x49,0x44,0x0C,0x41,0xD0,0x0B, /* 00000298 ""_HID.A.."" */ 0x00,0x08,0x5F,0x43,0x52,0x53,0x11,0x18, /* 000002A0 "".._CRS.."" */ 0x0A,0x15,0x47,0x01,0x70,0x00,0x70,0x00, /* 000002A8 ""..G.p.p."" */ 0x10,0x02,0x22,0x00,0x01,0x47,0x01,0x72, /* 000002B0 ""..""..G.r"" */ 0x00,0x72,0x00,0x02,0x06,0x79,0x00,0x5B, /* 000002B8 "".r...y.["" */ 0x82,0x44,0x04,0x4B,0x42,0x44,0x5F,0x08, /* 000002C0 "".D.KBD_."" */

Most likely you will never generate such a binary. But it helps if you know it's source form when you came to decode.

Purpose of DSDT

When your OS boots, it should parse the memory for ACPI tables. Then locate DSDT (and other tables as well, like SSDT), and decode it to get the list of installed devices. If you have that list, it's rather easy to load device driver for each.

Grey Cup Sunday, which ended with a taut little drama won by the Edmonton Eskimos over the Ottawa RedBlacks, 26-20, did what it was meant to do -– remind Canadians that being Canadian is meant to be fun.

Edmonton fans got what they wanted, a 14th championship. Ottawa fans deferred a dream that is like no other -– the first true challenge, with more dreams still to realize. Winnipeg got to be noticed, and its visitors got all the beer they could drink without getting nasty.

It was, indeed, more than everyone had a right to hope considering that the day dawned with an ugly controversy, the kind that at Super Bowl Week would have provided six days of crazed TV/radio/Internet/newspaper angst.

This was slightly less salacious than the 1999 Super Bowl prelude when Atlanta's Eugene Robinson tried to solicit an undercover cop in Miami for $40 of last-minute prep. But it was purely Canadian.

It had been approved to appear at the Grey Cup by the Canadian Football League bigshots, only to be banned Saturday after a complaint by the Edmonton Eskimos.

Now unless the fellows were going to menace the Eskimo players or staff with a bit of freelance pruning, this would not seem to provide a competitive advantage, but the Eskimos didn't want a presumably pro-RedBlacks crowd to become enamored with sawdust.

Since the Eskimos have been compared (mostly by fans of the other eight teams) with no great love to the New England Patriots because of its success and Belichickian world view, this made them the villains on game day, and provided yet one more reminder that this is crypto-serious business. THERE WILL BE NO GRATUITOUS LOGGING FOR THE PURPOSES OF WOODSY-LOOKING END TABLES, DAMN YOU!

Edmonton won that argument, and the game as well, because of a late touchdown run by backup quarterback Jordan Lynch, who played at Northern Illinois and was cut as a running back by the Chicago Bears a year ago. His career path is still anyone's guess, as the game's most valuable player was the guy starting ahead of him, Mike Reilly, but he will always be part of Edmonton history, which is a good way to get free drinks for a long time.

But that was the football. The fringe things, most of which you wouldn't see at any NFL game, let alone the one we host in February, gave the day its flavor, and the reason it should thrive well into a sometimes worrisome future.

• There was the stage for the pregame entertainment, which unlike your standard Super Bowl extravaganza, was seven pickup trucks (one per musician, two for the speakers) because the stadium architects didn't account for a ramp to get in an actual stage. And the halftime stage (for Fall Out Boy) was behind the stands in one end zone for the same reason. Seems Investors Group Field has some sprucing up to do, despite being barely a year old.

A large amount of student enrollment data at Illinois is available publicly, and some datasets date back to as early as the 1960s. Despite the vast amount of data being available, it is difficult to truly analyze and interpret the data as a whole in its current form. Although the recent data are stored in csv format, older data are stored in html, or even scanned pdfs.

Illinois has one of the largest international student populations in the US, and attracts over a third of its students from out of state. We thought it would be interesting to see the gender, race, and college breakdown at different geographical levels, and visualize where our classmates are coming from.

In order to do this, we break down the data into world, state, county and college levels and allows the users to interact with the data. Users can also explore the detailed view at each level, which provide visualizations of the aforementioned gender, race, college, and also yearly growth for the selected level.

This project was created by Clay Gregory, John Lee, and LJ Wong in Apr 2013 as part of CS467: Social Visualization, instructed by Karrie Karahalios at the University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign.

257048,False,1024,"Update January 27th, 2013: The Zen viewer has been discontinued by its creator.

Zena Juran released a new version of the Zen Viewer over the weekend – something I almost missed due to being busy with other things in-world (of which I'll say more another time). As mentioned in my original review earlier in the month, Zen is aimed at bringing an enhanced build experience to the V3.2 environment.

Currently still only available for windows, this new release (3.2.8.7) remains based on LL 3.2.8 Development / Project Viewer code, but sees some major changes and additions in terms of the TPV code that has been merged.

Installation and Start-up

The EXE retains more-or-less the same size as the 3.2.8.6 release, and the Viewer installs the same, complete with dedicated user folders and cache locations (rather than using the SL defaults).

Logging-in reveals little in the way of changes between 3.2.8.7 and earlier releases – other than the fact that the UI buttons are no longer transparent (more on this in a moment), the layout is the same as 3.2.8.6 and prior releases. However, open up Preferences, and the updates immediately make themselves apparent.

New Preferences Tabs

In my original review, I commented that Preferences were little-changed from V3.2, but Zena would be adding to the list of capabilities over time. Well, she has – and massively so! At the same time she's also re-arranged things somewhat.

Release 3.2.8.7 sees one tab in Preferences removed (LSL Pre-processing), and five new tabs added, together with an overall re-ordering of things which may initially catch used to operating by wrote a little off-guard (Graphics, for example has gone from near the top of the tab list to fairly well down the order of things). This shouldn't interfere with overall usability, however.

The five new tabs are (in the order displayed:

Name Tags : Pulls together the V3.2 (usually found in the General tab) and popular TPV options relating to name tags (setting colours, etc.) together into a single tab

: Pulls together the V3.2 (usually found in the General tab) and popular TPV options relating to name tags (setting colours, etc.) together into a single tab Shadows : pulls-in the shadow options popular among TPVs, and which can be found in a variety of locations (a sub-tab under graphics, for example)

: pulls-in the shadow options popular among TPVs, and which can be found in a variety of locations (a sub-tab under graphics, for example) Camera : pulls-together ""standard"" options such as view angle & distance (from MOVE & VIEW), disabling camera constraints (from the Advanced menu), depth of field on/off (duplicated from Graphics), and camera / DoF sliders again found in other TPVs

: pulls-together ""standard"" options such as view angle & distance (from MOVE & VIEW), disabling camera constraints (from the Advanced menu), depth of field on/off (duplicated from Graphics), and camera / DoF sliders again found in other TPVs Build: presents the Build enhancement tools first seen in the likes of Emerald / Phoenix, and now widely used in TPVs

Visual Auto-Mute

This is perhaps the most interesting change within Zen (and potentially the most drama-risk feature to pop-up in the Viewer code in general for a while), and is the first merge I've seen of a new functionality from LL that was recently released as a changeset (my apologies to other TPVs if they've in fact merged it as well, I'm still trying to catch up on 3 days of missed blogging and updates).

Essentially, this functionality allows you to set thresholds above which avatars with a very heavy load (high-res textures, complex attachments (multiple prims, flexi prims, sculpts, and what have you), etc., – but not scripts, which are a completely different kettle of fish) will not be rendered by your Viewer. Instead, they will appear as ""grey ghosts"", similar to when you've muted someone; however, you will still be able to IM them and chat with them. This should theoretically reduce the load placed on the Viewer and your system in terms of rendering, and lead to an improved SL experience.

I've covered Visual Auto-mute elsewhere, so will not dwell on it further here.

Graphics Preferences

The Graphics tab in Zen's Preferences has also been updated, with an improved overall layout, largely due to the removal of the low-med-high-ultra slider from the top of the tab (",0.0,0.6303922500875261,-0.9,-0.1

Robert Lawrence Stine's Goosebumps stories have sold more than 400 million copies worldwide in more than 30 languages, inspired a television series, games, merchandise, a film and now a live show.

With disorientating corridors, dark enclosed spaces and freaky horror scenes, the hugely popular Goosebumps book series comes to life in a new immersive theatre show taking audiences through hair-raising stories.

Based on the 1990s children's horror books by Robert Lawrence Stine, Goosebumps Alive leads viewers from one scary tale to another as they make their way around the dark tunnels of The Vaults venue at London's Waterloo.

From frightening monsters to killer scarecrows, the show – for adults – features plenty of nightmarish scenes, where public participation in encouraged at times.

""We wanted to do a show for adults for the main reason that there's this wealth of material of Goosebumps stories that we thought that an audience might be nostalgic for,"" director Tom Salamon said.

We didn't just want to recreate them for the stage, we wanted to take them in a sort of new and different reimagined, remixed fashion

""But we didn't just want to recreate them for the stage, we wanted to take them in a sort of new and different reimagined, remixed fashion. An immersive theatre is really an adult's kind of form and we thought it would fit really well in that world.""

Actor Jack Black, the protagonist of the Goosebumps film, at an event promoting the picture in 2015.

Stine's Goosebumps stories have sold more than 400 million copies worldwide in more than 30 languages, inspired a television series, games, merchandise and a film, released last year, starring funnyman Jack Black.

The London show features scenes from some of the author's famed tales such as Stay Out of the Basement and Say Cheese and Die! with contemporary twists.

Audiences are divided into groups and guided from one spooky setting to another as actors re-enact the scenes, with plenty of surprises and jumps thrown in.

""[Immersive theatre is] very different than traditional theatre or even film... You really feel like you're involved in this thing – it's very engaging,"" Salamon said.

""In terms of people wanting to be scared... People seem to be drawn to that and it's exhilarating is really what I think it is. It's a rush.""

256783,True,894,"On Friday, a Supreme Court of Nova Scotia judge struck down a law that allowed people who believed they were being ""cyberbullied"" to apply for legal protections. But in striking down the law, in favor of constitutional rights, the judge also returned the province to its previous void of legal protections for people experiencing online abuse.

The Cyber-safety Act was passed in the wake of the highly-publicized death of Rehtaeh Parsons with the goal of offering protection in severe cases like hers. The 17-year-old attempted suicide and later died after she was relentlessly harassed by her peers, who circulated a photo she alleged showed her being raped.

But the Cyber-safety Act's definition of ""cyberbullying"" — essentially, the repeated use of technology to cause harm to another person's well-being — has drawn criticism for being too broad.

That criticism became abundantly apparent in the case of two feuding businessmen: Robert Snell tweeted and blogged snide remarks that Giles Crouch believed were aimed at him. In one case, after the two men saw each other in the street, Snell tweeted, ""You see someone and want to clothesline them … That is normal, right?"" Crouch applied for and obtained a Cyber Protection Order against Snell under the Cyber-safety Act, but that order was voided today by Supreme Court of Nova Scotia justice Glen McDougall.

Related: Rehtaeh Parsons' Death Inspired a Cyberbullying Law in Canada — But Does It Hurt Free Speech?

The judge sided with lawyer David Fraser, who argued the act infringed on two sections of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. Fraser argued the definition of ""cyberbullying"" cast a broad net and violated section 2 (b), which guarantees freedom of expression, and the judge agreed, calling the Act a ""spectacular failure"" in its breadth.

Fraser also pointed out to the court that legislation allowed complainants to apply for and receive a protection order without the alleged perpetrator of the harassment having any say in court. In his client's case, Snell wasn't aware Crouch had asked for such an order until a police officer served him with it, which the judge agreed violated section seven of the Charter, which guarantees the right to life, liberty and security of the person.

Fraser didn't ask the judge to throw out the law. Instead, he wanted the act amended, which would allow Nova Scotians to continue to apply for its protection.

When VICE News spoke to the lawyer in August, he said it was unlikely the court would throw out the Act in its entirety.

In an interview Friday, Fraser agreed that a void currently exists in protections for harassment, but said severe cases of online harassment have protections under existing laws. In Parsons' case, for example, there were criminal harassment and child pornography charges that could have been applied, but at least initially, law enforcement failed to apply them.

Related: Canada's New Cyberbullying Law Is Targeting Teen Sexting Gone Awry

""In severe cases of online harassment, I actually don't think that there's a void. We do have existing laws under the criminal code and civil remedies that are available in those extreme cases,"" Fraser said.

""The bigger question to ask, and I think the Cyber-safety Act actually created a little bit of a diversion from that: why were the existing laws not actually applied by the police and the prosecutors at the time?""

However, Fraser said that any legislation that addresses that existing gap has to properly define ""cyberbullying."" His definition would include intent to cause harm, and would take into account vulnerabilities of the complainant and their relationship to the alleged harasser.

Fraser added that any new ""cyberbullying"" legislation should include a proper defense, such as fair comment and the defense of truth — both valid defenses in civil defamation law.

""Do I think that there is a place for a law like a Cyber-safety Act that does provide relief for victims of cyberbullying that might not amount to criminal conduct, or that would allow you to deal with situations outside of the criminal justice system, which is a pretty blunt instrument, I do.""

257928,False,1024,"David Cole teaches constitutional law at Georgetown University and is the legal affairs correspondent for the Nation. He is the author of ""The Torture Memos: Rationalizing the Unthinkable.""

When then-CIA Director Michael Hayden appeared before the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence in April 2007 to testify about the CIA's coercive interrogation program, he should have felt pretty comfortable.

The program, after all, had been blessed repeatedly by the Justice Department, which by then had written multiple secret memos explaining why slamming people into walls, depriving them of sleep for up to 10 days and waterboarding them was perfectly legal. President George W. Bush, Vice President Dick Cheney, Attorney General John Ashcroft, White House Counsel Alberto Gonzales, Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld, national security adviser Condoleezza Rice and other Cabinet officials had all personally approved of the program. Bush had declared a few months earlier, in fact, that the program had ""saved innocent lives."" The Senate committee, whose leaders had been briefed on the program as early as September 2002 and had done nothing to halt it, had a reputation for coddling as much as overseeing the intelligence community. This was hardly a hostile audience. Hayden was talking to the home team.

Why, then, did Hayden misrepresent virtually every aspect of the program to the committee?

His misstatements are carefully catalogued in a damning appendix to the committee's report, released Tuesday. According to the appendix, Hayden made false or unsupported statements about the genesis of the program; the interrogation of Abu Zubaida, the CIA's first disappeared detainee; the qualifications and training of the interrogators; the ability of interrogators and observers to halt interrogations at any time; the number of detainees held; the intelligence allegedly obtained from coercive tactics; abusive and illegal conduct by interrogators; and the effectiveness of waterboarding. Hayden has objected that the committee took some of his statements out of context, and he has noted that, in any event, the program preceded his tenure as CIA director. But the evidence of false and unsupported testimony is overwhelming.

Consider just three examples. Hayden claimed that all of those conducting the program were ""carefully chosen and carefully screened"" and underwent more than 250 hours of specialized training. In fact, the CIA's records show that it chose interrogators who ""had engaged in inappropriate detainee interrogations, had workplace anger management issues, and had reportedly admitted to sexual assault,"" according to the Senate report. Some interrogators were given no training at all; others had 65 hours — not 250.

Hayden also claimed that all interrogations were observed by nonparticipants and that ""any observer can call 'knock it off' at any time."" He said no one expressed any reservations. In fact, CIA records show that many involved did object to the procedures, to no avail. When one team member questioned the legality of the techniques being applied to Abu Zubaida, for example, CIA supervisor Jose Rodriguez instructed the team member to stop using ""speculative language as to the legality of given activities"" in agency cables. During the interrogation of Abu Zubaida, CIA cables report that several team members were ""to the point of tears and choking up,"" and that two or three said they would seek transfers if the abuse continued. (And it did continue.)

Hayden also denied that any interrogators ever punched anyone or threatened family members of detainees, and assured the committee that any abuse would be reported. In fact, CIA records disclose the use of a ""hard takedown"" method, in which about five team members jumped a detainee, hooded him, cut away his clothes, punched him and dragged him down a hallway. Other records show that interrogators threatened to kill, capture or assault family members if suspects did not talk. Some of the most notorious abuses, including the use of a gun and an electric drill to threaten one detainee, were never reported, because the supervisor assumed the tactic had been approved.

Hayden was following a well-trod path. The CIA gave false information about Abu Zubaida to the Justice Department when seeking initial approval to use waterboarding and other torture tactics, asserting that he was uncooperative when in fact he had been providing a great deal of information to FBI agents using lawful interrogation methods. The CIA later claimed that the waterboarding of Abu Zubaida had produced critical intelligence about other al-Qaeda members, but the agency's records show that Abu Zubaida provided that information before being subjected to coercive tactics.

The CIA stonewalled Intelligence Committee requests for information about the program, and it falsely told the White House, the Justice Department and the intelligence panel that its coercive tactics had elicited critical intelligence that disrupted plots and led to the capture of many al-Qaeda members. On Thursday, CIA Director John Brennan admitted that the agency does not actually know whether any of its coercive tactics led directly to useful information — and indeed that it is ""unknowable.""

There is a simple reason Hayden and the CIA would misrepresent so much about a put",0.1985268148671422,0.7985268148671423,-0.6000000000000001,0.0
256768,True,921,"While hardly considered an ""alt-right"" personality (despite his professed support of Donald Trump), Martin Shkreli today encountered the full fury of the Jack Dorsey social media apparatus scorned, when his Twitter account was suspended. The suspension, reported first by The Verge, is allegedly in retaliation for Shkreli's ""targeted harassment"" against freelance reporter Lauren Duca.

As Verge notes, Duca had recently made the media spotlight after penning a Teen Vogue essay titled ""Trump is Gaslighting America"" which went viral because, ostensibly, Teen Vogue is one of the few media outlets in the US not considered ""fake news"" by either part of the ideological divide. She was subsequently invited to a face-off with Fox News' Tucker Carlson. That clip in turn also went viral due to Carlson's statement that Duca should stop talking about politics and ""stick to thigh-high boots."" Following her media appearances, Shkreli, a professed Trump supporter, has decided to troll her.

The (sexual) tension between the two escalated last week when Duca tweeted a screenshot of a direct message from Shkreli, who in 2015 was briefly described as ""the world's most hated man"" after hiking the price on an anti-parasitic drug 56 times (before it emerged that virtually every other pharma company does the same if to a slighly less shocking extent), refusing to answer questions about alleged fraud, getting arrested on charges of securities fraud (he remains free on $5 million bail), and asking celebs to listen to a rare Wu-Tang Clan album with him.

In his message he asked her if she wanted to be his date to President-elect Trump's inauguration. Her response: ""I would rather eat my own organs.""

I would rather eat my own organs pic.twitter.com/IgeCRZqk8w — Lauren Duca (@laurenduca) January 5, 2017

Following the exchange, Shkreli added a line to his Twitter bio saying he had ""a small crush on @laurenduca."" He also changed his profile image to a doctored photo of Duca and her husband, swapping his face into the image. He changed his banner to a collage of photos of Duca, overlaid with lyrics from John Michael Montgomery's 1994 single ""I Swear."" Stepping up his trolling game, Shrekli also tweeted that he had purchased the domain name ""marrymelauren.com."" Shkreli's followers then joined in, tweeting more Photoshops of Shkreli with Duca.

Speaking to The Verge prior to his Twitter suspension, Shkreli said he didn't see his actions as harassment and wouldn't consider them to be ""against Duca's will"" because she hadn't responded to any messages from him or told him to stop. He said he thought the Photoshop images were similar to those someone would make of ""Justin Bieber or any other celebrity.""

Duca's reaction, however, was less sanguine and at 10:55am she tweeted Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey asking ""How is this allowed""

By 1:00pm Eastern, Shrekli's account had been suspended.

Previously, Twitter made headlines in July 2016 when it permanently banned Breitbart tech editor Milo Yiannopoulos after what Twitter dubbed targeted harassment against Ghostbusters star Leslie Jones. Dorsey responded directly to a tweet from Jones at the time.

Verge's conclusion: ""if you don't want to be harassed on Twitter's platform you can always hope things get bad enough (or you're famous enough) that you can get the CEO's ear.""

In early December, shortly after a purge of dozens of ""alt-right"" Twitter accounts, Slate reported that Twitter may even consider banning none other than the Donald Trump:

Asked whether Twitter would ever consider banning key government officials or even the president himself, a company spokesperson responded via email: ""The Twitter Rules prohibit violent threats, harassment, hateful conduct, and multiple account abuse, and we will take action on accounts violating those policies."" Pressed on whether that meant that, hypothetically, Trump himself could be suspended were he to violate those policies, a spokesperson confirmed: ""The Twitter Rules apply to all accounts, including verified accounts.""

258697,True,616,"NEWARK — Construction on an extension of PATH service to Newark Liberty International Airport is scheduled to begin in late 2018 and be completed five years later, according to documents from the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey.

A request for proposals, or RFP, to manage the $1.5 billion project issued on Sept. 26 calls for construction to begin in the first quarter of 2018, with completion scheduled for the fourth quarter of 2023. The management contract for the project is to be awarded by the end of this year, according to the the RFP, which notes that the dates are subject to change.

Proponents of the project say it would provide a one-seat mass transit link between the airport and the heart of the metropolitan area it serves, an amenity that has come to be expected by frequent fliers.

Planners and transit advocates say a PATH airport extension would also provide a convenient and affordable commuting option for airport workers in Hudson and Essex counties as well as New York. Environmentalists have embraced the project as a means of reducing automobile traffic.

Support dates back at least to the late 1970's, when an advisory panel recommended the link. The Port Authority commissioned a study that recommended the project in 2012, and it was included in the agency's current $27.6 billion 10-year capital plan adopted in February, though without a specific time frame.

A Port Authority spokesman, Steve Coleman, confirmed that Friday's RFP was the first document to lay out a schedule for the project, but cautioned that the dates were not set in stone. Proponents nonetheless welcomed word that construction was now at least tentatively scheduled to begin.


""21st Century transportation is vital if we're going to compete with major airports around the country and the globe,"" said Joe Sitt, chaiman of the Global Gateway Alliance, an airport advocacy group. ""So we're glad to see the Port Authority putting concrete milestones on the table toward making a one-seat ride from the World Trade Center PATH to Newark Airport a reality.""

The extension is to run from the PATH's western terminus at Newark Penn Station, along an existing Northeast Corridor right of way used by Amtrak and New Jersey Transit trains. NJ Transit already provides heavy rail service between Newark Penn and Newark Liberty via a station on the Northeast Corridor linked to the air terminals and other areas by the airport monorail.

The PATH extension would be largely redundant, following the same route and using the same monorail link. But riders could continue on PATH trains from Newark Penn on to Harrison, Jersey City stops at Journal Square, Grove Street and Exchange Place and at the World Trade Center in Manhattan. With a single transfer, PATH riders from Hoboken or Manhattan's West Side could also reach the airport, albeit in a two-seat ride.

256652,True,742,"Pope Francis on 10 Reasons Why People Reject the Church

The Church's most prominent outreach today, the New Evangelization, aims at reviving the spiritual lives of those who have drifted from Christ. While these people may have been baptized and perhaps catechized, while they may attend Church semi-regularly, they have never been truly evangelized. They have never experienced a life-changing encounter with Jesus Christ or real transformation through his Church.

A couple weeks ago, Pope Francis delivered a powerful message to the Brazilian bishops in the midst of his World Youth Day celebrations. Unfortunately, it didn't get nearly the attention it deserved.

Speaking on the New Evangelization, and using the Emmaus Journey as a framework, the Pope encouraged his listeners to reflect on why people reject the Church today—why, like the Emmaus disciples, they decide to walk the other way. To bring people back to Christ and his Church, we must understand why they leave in the first place.

To that end, Pope Francis offered ten specific reasons:

1. The Church no longer offers anything meaningful or important.

2. The Church appears too weak.

3. The Church appears too distant from their needs.

4. The Church appears too poor to respond to their concerns.

5. The Church appears too cold.

6. The Church appears too caught up with itself.

7. The Church appears to be a prisoner of its own rigid formulas.

8. The world seems to have made the Church a relic of the past.

9. The Church appears unfit to answer the world's new questions.

10. The Church speaks to people in their infancy but not when they come of age.


Read the excerpt below for more context:

""The two disciples have left Jerusalem. They are leaving behind the 'nakedness' of God. They are scandalized by the failure of the Messiah in whom they had hoped and who now appeared utterly vanquished, humiliated, even after the third day.


Here we have to face the difficult mystery of those people who leave the Church, who, under the illusion of alternative ideas, now think that the Church—their Jerusalem—can no longer offer them anything meaningful and important. So they set off on the road alone, with their disappointment. Perhaps the Church appeared too weak, perhaps too distant from their needs, perhaps too poor to respond to their concerns, perhaps too cold, perhaps too caught up with itself, perhaps a prisoner of its own rigid formulas, perhaps the world seems to have made the Church a relic of the past, unfit for new questions; perhaps the Church could speak to people in their infancy but not to those come of age.


It is a fact that nowadays there are many people like the two disciples of Emmaus; not only those looking for answers in the new religious groups that are sprouting up, but also those who already seem godless, both in theory and in practice.


Faced with this situation, what are we to do?


We need a Church unafraid of going forth into their night. We need a Church capable of meeting them on their way. We need a Church capable of entering into their conversation. We need a Church able to dialogue with those disciples who, having left Jerusalem behind, are wandering aimlessly, alone, with their own disappointment, disillusioned by a Christianity now considered barren, fruitless soil, incapable of generating meaning.""

Which of these reasons do you see as most significant?

256561,True,585,"HARRISBURG - Gov. Wolf on Tuesday stood by embattled state Attorney General Kathleen G. Kane, saying that despite her looming legal problems, she still can carry out the duties of her office and does not need to resign.

In an interview in the Capitol, Wolf acknowledged that Kane, the first woman and Democrat elected to the office, must work to keep the public's support as she awaits a decision on whether she will face criminal charges. But that doesn't mean she needs to step down, he said.

""I think we ought to let the judicial system play out,"" said Wolf, leader of the state's Democrats. ""We have procedures in place for adjudicating the rights and wrongs . . . and I think we ought to let those procedures play out.""

Kane has deflected calls to resign as Montgomery County District Attorney Risa Vetri Ferman weighs whether to charge her with perjury, obstruction, contempt of court, and other crimes in the leaking of secret information to a Philadelphia newspaper, allegedly to punish a political rival. A statewide grand jury recommended that Kane be charged.

Kane's attorney and private spokesman, Lanny Davis, said last week that Kane was innocent and the victim of ""cowardly"" people working behind the scenes to destroy her. Davis has blamed ""angry Republican men"" who he said are upset at her political ascent and have plotted to bring her down.

The editorial boards of news outlets across the state have urged Kane to resign. She has said she will not.

In such editorials last week, The Inquirer and PennLive/the Harrisburg Patriot-News cited her handling of two major criminal investigations since taking office. In 2013, The Inquirer reported, Kane shut down an undercover sting operation that captured elected Democrats from Philadelphia accepting cash or gifts. Philadelphia District Attorney Seth Williams resurrected the case, charging six people.

Last week, the paper reported that sources and documents indicate Kane also undermined an investigation into a state Gaming Board lawyer with ties to politically connected Scranton billionaire Louis DeNaples. After the case withered, DeNaples contributed $25,000 to Kane's campaign. She later returned the contribution.

In Tuesday's interview, Wolf stressed that he was not a lawyer, but said he believed that Kane, in her time as attorney general, has had to make decisions on some tough cases.

""The extent to which she has done that the right or wrong way will be determined by the court,"" he said.

He said he had not had any discussions with Kane about her legal problems, and that no one has asked him to speak with her about resigning for the good of the party or the integrity of her office.

""It hasn't happened,"" Wolf said. ""I don't know who would make that call.""",0.6647298024447623,0.7647298024447623,-0.1,0.0

256499,False,1024,"In an 81-page report released Monday evening, the best and brightest minds in the economic drug policy world send the United Nations a loaded message about the drug war: Enough.

The individual analyses of the economists and drug policy experts, signed by five Nobel Prize winners in economics, expose the collateral damage of the drug war and offer suggestions on how the policies can—and should—change.

""Academics and economists have great insight into this issue—and for so long, they've been ignored,"" said John Collins, the International Drug Policy Project Coordinator at the London School of Economics, which produced the report. ""Evidenced-based data about the war on drugs has been lacking for too long. It's time that something changes.""

Collins noted that the report, titled ""Ending the Drug Wars,"" is nowhere near a simple fix. ""There is no single way to solve this issue,"" he said. ""It's an extraordinarily complex issue. We've tried to fix it with a singular approach—the drug war—and that hasn't worked.""

The LSE's report joins a chorus of voices speaking out against the war on drugs in recent years. ""We're not saying, 'In 30 years, this is what our drug policy landscape should look like,'"" Collins said. ""We're saying, 'This isn't working. We need to start moving in a different direction.'""

Here, in five steps, is a summation of the LSE report's road map:

1. A "" drug-free world "" is not plausible.

In the opening chapter, written by Collins, the economist argues that believing we'll live in a world free from drugs one day is not only deluded, it's counterproductive. Collins blames prohibitionist forces in 1961 for perpetuating this fantasy—which he says still exists. In a seemingly heroic attempt to make this fantasy come true, he argues, we've assumed that the illicit market can be tamed through enforcement. ""A global system which predominantly encourages policies that transfer the costs of prohibition onto poorer producer and transit countries, as the current system does, is an ineffective and unsustainable way to control drugs in the long term."" Collins argues for the decriminalization of drugs, which he calls a ""far more effective tool.""

2. Realize that prohibition isn ' t necessarily the problem.

In the third chapter, ""Effects of Prohibition, Enforcement and Interdiction on Drug Use,"" Jonathan P. Caulkins, the H. Guyford Stever Professor of Operations Research and Public Policy at Carnegie Mellon, argues that there are benefits to prohibition—such as reduced dependence. Caulkins suggests that the current failures of prohibition are ""overstated"" and that the benefits may outweigh the costs. One example he offers to support his point is a group of friends who want to get stoned and listen to jazz but instead decide to go to a movie. ""How much they actually enjoyed going to the movies is a loss whose value should be charged to prohibition,"" he writes.

3. But prohibition isn ' t the answer, either.

The fourth chapter, ""Why Is Strict Prohibition Collapsing?,"" written by Daniel Mejia, an associate economics professor in Colombia, and Pascual Restrepo, a Ph.D. candidate at MIT, shows the dark side of Caulkins's argument. Classifying prohibition as a system based on ""ideological positions,"" the two elaborate on the violence and corruption that can result from banning drugs. Statistics to support it are staggering. Since 2007, 220,000 people have abandoned Ciudad Juárez as a result of the war on drugs, according to the London School of Economics. The war on drugs in Colombia has led to the second-largest internally displaced population in the world.

4. Stop sacrificing basic human rights.

Alejandro Madrazo Lajous, a professor in the Legal Studies Division of the Centro de Investigación y Docencia Económica (CIDE) in Mexico, argues that on top of the monetary costs of the war on drugs are the constitutional costs of ""enforcing"" what he views as an ideological war. ""Creating an 'exceptional' regime of diminished fundamental rights goes against the logic of fundamental rights: that they can be universal,"" he writes. ""The structural design of constitutional government should not be adjusted in function of specific, purportedly transitory policies.""

5. Put an end to mass imprisonment of drug offenders.

On the heels of Madrazo's claim, Ernest Drucker, adjunct professor of epidemiology at Columbia University, dives into one of the most costly, counterproductive byproducts of the war on drugs in America: mass imprisonment. Drucker details the grisly measures used to punish inmates brought in on drug charges in the U.S.—citing discipline that includes hard labor, severe mental and physical privations, isolation, body mutilation, and execution.

256703,True,757,"A number of teams have a chance to make one final statement and pad their résumés during conference championship weekend.

What will each team's résumé look like with a win or loss on Saturday?

With the help of ESPN's strength of record metric (SOR), we can project how each team's overall body of work will stack up. Strength of record measures the chance an average top-25 team would have a team's record or better, given its schedule. We often display strength of record as a rank, but behind those rankings are calculations that give an actual probability. For example, an average top-25 team would have a 3 percent chance of starting 11-1 or better against Ohio State's schedule.

After defeating Colorado on Friday night, Washington moved up to No. 4 in strength of record.

ESPN Analytics

But what will the rankings look like after Saturday's games? We can project strength of record based on if a team wins or loses. It's important to note these may change overnight depending on the actual results of the games. Nonetheless, below you will find the percentage chance for an average top-25 team to achieve each team's record or better based on various outcomes Saturday:

Chance of achieving team's W-L from perspective of average top-25 team Teams in contention for CFP Current With Win With Loss Alabama (12-0) <1% <1% 2% Ohio State (11-1) 3% -- -- Clemson (11-1) 7% 5% 19% Washington (12-1) 11% -- -- Wisconsin (10-2) 16% 10% 29% Colorado (10-3) 27% -- -- Penn State (10-2) 28% 16% 42% Michigan (10-2) 30% -- -- Oklahoma (9-2) 32% 23% 49% Oklahoma State (9-2) 57% 34%* 63% *11% if OSU had defeated Central Michigan

-- Alabama will likely end the season with the strongest strength of record, no matter the result of the SEC championship game.

-- Will Washington hang onto the fourth spot in SOR? If Wisconsin beats Penn State it will be a tight race between the Badgers and Huskies for No. 4. However, if Penn State wins, Washington appears to have the clear edge to remain in the top four.

-- If Clemson loses, the Tigers would likely drop out of the top four in SOR and open the door for a Big Ten team.

-- Michigan will remain outside the top five in SOR without another chance for a quality win. The Wolverines are the greatest example of best vs. most deserving, though, with a top-three ranking in ESPN's Football Power Index and nearly every other power ranking.

-- Finally, the Big 12's outlook looks bleak, but one interesting number from above is Oklahoma State's strength of record assuming a win Saturday, and assuming they had defeated Central Michigan. The Cowboys would be right in the mix for the fourth-best SOR.

There are obviously more factors that contribute to a team's seeding and inclusion in the playoff than simply its résumé (eye test, team strength, etc.), but strength of record, though not designed to predict the playoff, has correlated closely with the committee's rankings the past two seasons. Seven of the eight teams to make the playoff the past two seasons ranked in the top four in strength of record.

If the favorites win Saturday the rankings may not change too much, but if mayhem ensues, keep an eye on these projections to see how each team's résumé will stack up.",0.2915801874150912,0.6915801874150912,-0.30000000000000004,-0.1
259006,False,1024,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump told Reuters on Thursday that he was ""psyched"" to terminate the NAFTA trade deal with Canada and Mexico, but changed his mind after their leaders asked for it to be renegotiated instead.

Trump said in an interview with Reuters that he will not hesitate to change course again and pull the plug on the North American Free Trade Agreement if the negotiations become ""unserious.""

His comments came at the end of a long 24 hours during which Ottawa and Mexico City were whipsawed over the Trump administration's intentions over the 23-year-old trade pact.

""You know I was really ready and psyched to terminate NAFTA,"" Trump said.

He decided that it would be better to terminate the trade deal after hearing about Wisconsin farmers' struggles with new Canadian dairy rules that were shutting out their milk protein exports.

""You saw that, you wrote about it,"" Trump said. ""And I said I've had it. I've had it.""

But after administration officials said a withdrawal order was being prepared, Trump said he received phone calls from Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau asking to renegotiate the pact.

""I'm not looking to hurt Canada and I'm not looking to hurt Mexico. They're two countries I really like,"" Trump said. ""So they asked to renegotiate, and I said yes.""

News of the possible U.S. pullout from NAFTA rattled financial markets on Wednesday. Relative calm returned on Thursday after Trump's comments, and the Mexican peso strengthened 0.86 percent against the U.S. dollar, while the Canadian dollar was flat versus the greenback.

Mexico, Canada and the United States form one of the world's biggest trading blocs, and trade disruptions among them could adversely affect farm, automotive, energy and other sectors in all three countries. NAFTA removed most trade and tariff barriers between the neighbors, but Trump and other critics have blamed it for deep U.S. job cuts.

Trump campaigned for president last year on a pledge to pull out of NAFTA if he could not renegotiate better terms. The United States went from running a small goods trade surplus with Mexico in the early 1990s to a $63-billion deficit in 2016.

Asked by Reuters what would make NAFTA a fair deal, Trump said: ""Open markets. Open borders for trade"" and ""Fairness, no government subsidies so that it makes it impossible for our people to compete.""

He added that if the NAFTA negotiations ""become unserious, I will terminate.""

As Trump spoke, a new trade irritant between the United States and Canada emerged, as Boeing Co asked the U.S. Commerce Department to investigate alleged price dumping and unfair Canadian government subsidies for Bombardier Inc's new Canadian-made CSeries jetliners.

Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau (L) walks down the West Wing colonnade with U.S. President Donald Trump at the White House in Washington, U.S., February 13, 2017. REUTERS/Kevin Lamarque

'GET TO WORK'

Trudeau told a news conference in Saskatchewan he had urged Trump not to withdraw from the trade pact and warned that doing so ""would cause a lot of short- and medium-term pain.""

""That's not something that either one of us would want, so we agreed that we could sit down and get to work on looking at ways to improve NAFTA,"" Trudeau said.

Canada sends 75 percent of its exports to the United States. On Tuesday, Trump said he did not fear a trade war with Canada, a day after his administration moved to impose tariffs on Canadian lumber.

In Mexico City, Mexican Foreign Minister Luis Videgaray said Pena Nieto had called Trump on Wednesday and spoken with him for about 20 minutes in a conversation focused exclusively on the looming talks over NAFTA's ""renegotiation and modernization.""

Trump has accused Mexico of luring away American factories and jobs with cheap labor and other advantages enabled by NAFTA. During the presidential campaign he accused Mexico of sending rapists and criminals into the United States, and as president plans a U.S.-Mexico border wall.

One of Trump's first major acts after becoming president in January was to pull out of the 12-nation Trans-Pacific Partnership, negotiated by his Democratic predecessor Barack Obama.

Several agriculture lobby groups in Washington were told U.S Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue, confirmed by the Senate on Monday, met with Trump on Wednesday evening to dissuade him from withdrawing from NAFTA.

American Soybean Association President Ron Moore said, ""When you're talking about $3 billion in soybean exports a year, any threats to withdraw from agreements and walk away from markets makes farmers extremely nervous.""

We also are very conscious of being good stewards of public and donor dollars. So when you read or hear that ABI has spent $350,000 in legal fees protecting the brand, please understand that this amount reflects our efforts over the course of seven years and includes annual trademark and licensing fees.

Although we have only been to court once on these matters, ABI has been involved in various alternative dispute resolution methods, including arbitration and mediation, in order to protect the trademark for the public good. For that one court case, it is not true that it cost ABI ""only $25,000."" In order to protect our right to use our own name and misuse of the name, the total cost was nearly $100,000.

Persona 4 was a story about acceptance. We all have a dark side, some aspect of our personality we dislike about ourselves, something we choose to repress and hide away from the rest of the world. This isn't the healthiest practice, though. Atlus shows us a cavalcade of otherwise normal, healthy people become consumed by the enemy within. By the time the Investigation Team solves the mystery behind the Inaba murders, it's more than clear that accepting our personal weaknesses, flaws, and undesirable traits are key in becoming a stronger, more successful human being who can connect with others and the world around us.

Dancing All Night explores a similar motif, revolving around a group of Rise's peers, a band of pop idols named Kanamin Kitchen, who have been made to lead double lives. Having been manufactured by a record label, these girls are made to act and dress in certain ways that aren't reflective of who they really are. Nobody knows the real them. Deep down, they feel fake and isolated, trapped and forced to conform to public perception, like marionettes dancing for the crowd. All anyone sees is their masks, not the identities they're compelled to conceal, nothing that runs contrary to fantasies held by legions of adoring fans who actually care nothing for them.

Yes, in some ways, this is a thought-provoking followup to the themes present in Persona 4. It's also a fun little rhythm game.

Persona 4: Dancing All Night (PS Vita)

Developer: Atlus

Publisher: Atlus

Released: September 29, 2015

MSRP: $49.99

Taking place shortly after the events of Persona 4, Dancing All Night opens with Rise Kujikawa and a couple members of the gang in a dance studio. The former idol is mounting a comeback and has enlisted her friends as backup dancers to perform at a large music festival. Of course, things quickly go awry. A cursed Internet video has droves of people falling into comas, and to top it all off, members of Kanamin Kitchen, the pop group headed by Rise's frenemy Kanami Mashita, have gone missing.

We soon find out the women have been transported to an alternate dimension called the Midnight Stage, where a mysterious voice and hordes of Shadows hold them hostage. Kanamin Kitchen's captors prey on idols' identity crises and try to make them fall in line with the image of what people think believe are, or want them to be, rather than wage any sort of painful personal struggle.

The Investigation Team naturally comes to the rescue, except in this world they can't use their Personas to fight. The only way to beat back the Shadows and save Rise and Kanami's friends is to dance. It's a contrived plot device to shoehorn in rhythmic gameplay based on Sega's Hatsune Miku: Project Diva series, but honestly, who cares when the end result is a damn good time?

The mechanics at work here are nothing revolutionary. Notes appear in the center of a circle and fly outward toward six zones on circle's perimeter in formations based on music. Players are tasked with keeping the beat, the success or failure of which will determine things like high scores, whether new levels are unlocked, and earn in-game currency for purchasing items and costumes.

Dancing All Night functions perfectly, and its three main difficulty settings all feel appropriately challenging. Regardless of which you choose, a poor performance will result in a quick hook, though a mediocre one may allow you to complete a level without passing. This can be a powerful motivator, and definitely kept me coming back to some of the tougher stages. On top of the standard fare, there's also an even harder (hidden) difficulty setting awaiting dedicated players. So good luck with that!

Aside from the joy of watching familiar faces like Teddie and Chie cavort around in ridiculous outfits, what makes Dancing All Night a blast is the music itself. One of my favorite aspects of the Persona series is composer Shoji Meguro's handiwork, which is obviously thrust into the spotlight this time around. After completing both the story and free dance modes (plus redeeming some downloadable content) I've unlocked 36 songs, spanning everything from original Persona 4 tracks to spin-off theme songs and even a live performance. However, while that may conceptually seem like a decent-sized selection, it doesn't always feel that way.

Half of the soundtrack is padded out with remixes that may or may not resonate with players. While I absolutely loved many of them, there are others I will seldom play again. I found it difficult at times to appreciate versions of songs I've adored for years, only to have some DJ somewhere strip the track of nearly all its personality and transform it into something else entirely.

Dancing All Night's uneven score wasn't the only facet of the experience that wasn't as compelling",0.5504956544658473,0.7504956544658472,-0.1,-0.1

Bootleg games are illegal copies of legitimate games. There are four quick and easy ways to spot if a Nintendo DS cartridge is a bootleg. If suspicious, check multiple items – not all bootlegs will have the same flaws.

#1 – Cartridge won't boot in a Nintendo DSi unit:

As the newest version of the DS system on the market, the Nintendo DSi includes a newer version of the operating system from the manufacturer that does a better job at detecting bootleg software and rejecting it with an error message. After launching the game, you'll see the message below displayed on the bottom screen.

Non-booting DS screen


Power down the system, remove the cartridge and re-insert it. Power the system back on and try to launch the game. If you receive this error again, it's very likely you have a bootleg game.


#2 – Cartridge Construction is of low quality:

Two things you can quickly check without having a Nintendo DSi handy is the quality of the cartridge's construction. First, with any Nintendo DS cartridge you'll notice a seam down the middle of the side. If you tug on this with a fingernail, the cartridge should not separate at all. If it does, you've got a bootleg.

Back of cartridge


Second, look at the back of the cartridge. Here, you see a bootleg cartridge on the left and a real cartridge on the right. Inside the Nintendo Racetrack logo, you'll notice that outlined in blue, the real cartridge has the registered trademark logo ® after the word ""Nintendo"". This is missing from the bootleg. Also, above the gold contact points, there are white letters and numbers. While the letters in this picture say ""Nintendo"", not all cartridges will – but all legitimate cartridges will have white letters above these gold contact points.


#3 - Matching the Serial Numbers:

Each published title has a serial number unique to itself. This serial number can be found on the front of the cartridge and on the back of the game case, next to the UPC. On the cartridge, you''ll find the serial number in the format of NTR-XXXX-YYY, where XXXX is the unique serial number for that game, and YYY represents the region, such as USA.

Serial numbers


On the back of the game case, you''ll find the serial number again, in the format of NTR-P-XXXX, again where XXXX is the unique serial number. These two serial numbers will always match on a legitimate copy of the game. Also, compare this serial number to the string of letters printed in black on the back of the cartridge. The first four letters on the back will always match this serial number as well.


#4 – The Case of the Odd Case:

There are three types of DS Game Cases. The standard US case is black and has a slot for holding Game Boy Advance games that is solid. Newer ""eco-friendly"" DS cases have no GBA slot and feature a cut-out recycling symbol behind the manual. The Japanese case is black and has a slot for holding Game Boy Advance games that is in three pieces. The European case is clear and thicker, to accommodate game manuals in multiple languages. Games sold in the US are NEVER sold in the European style cases and rarely ever sold in the Japanese style cases. While there are a few exceptions to the Japanese cases, if you spot a US game in a Japanese case, it should draw your attention to look at the game itself more closely.

258266,False,1024,"In a new article at the Prospect, Harold Meyerson tells us that unions are getting higher marks than they did a few years ago:

Gallup and Pew concur: Just over one-half of Americans approve of labor unions. In late June, the Pew Research Center released the results of its biennial poll on unions and corporations, and reported that 51 percent of Americans had a favorable view of unions—up from just 41 percent in 2011, the last time Pew popped the question. Pew's new number is almost identical to Gallup's, which found that 52 percent of Americans approved of unions when it last asked that question in August of 2012. Gallup polls on union approval every year and has reported a 52 percent approval rating each of the past three years. Before then, union approval had hit an all-time low for Gallup surveys, with just 48 percent in 2009.

It's worth looking at the long term trend in the Gallup results:

Even with the persistent long-term PR campaign against unions (it dates back to the early 1900s but intensified in the 1970s as business groups made a renewed, well-funded and successful effort to move the US to the right), their approval level held in the 60% range until the crisis produced a new salvo against public unions, which looked like an easy target when state and local governments were desperately looking for costs to cut and public employees could be made to look cushily paid (we won't recover this ground; suffice it to say that there has been a lot of cherry picking and apples to stinky fruit comparisons in many of the attacks). Funny when someone actually makes a good career bet (public employees opted for what at the time were lesser paid but more secure jobs than private sector workers of comparable skills), they get demonized for it.

But the improvement of perception of unions reflects not just some waning of jealousy, but also among some a recognition of the fallen state of workers and the value of unions as a counterweight. Meyerson again:

Unions seeking warmer comfort in these numbers, however, can find some in Pew's demographic breakdown of its latest poll. While 51 percent of all Americans have favorable views of unions, 61 percent of Americans under 30 hold that view. Indeed, respondents 29 or younger were the only age group in which unions had a higher favorability rating than ""business corporations,"" which had the approval rating of just 51 percent of the young. Union approval ratings grew weaker as respondents grew older—from 50 percent among Americans aged 30 to 49; to 49 percent among those 50 to 64; and to just 42 percent among Americans 65 or over. The irony for unions —and in theory, the opportunity—is that the youngest Americans are the least unionized. The latest data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics show that labor force participants under 25 have a unionization rate of 4.2 percent, a figure that rises steadily—but not much—as the age cohorts grow older, topping out at 14.9 percent among workers aged 55 to 64. So wherever young people got their disproportionately favorable impression of unions, it didn't come from their personal exposure to them. Then again, young people in the early 1930s—a time when union membership collapsed, along with the economy in general—didn't have much personal exposure to unions either, yet they became the most pro-union generation in American history. What both these generations have in common is a far greater skepticism about the economy in general and a much stronger belief that the economy is rigged to ordinary workers' disadvantage. The Thirties generation demonstrated this by joining parties of the Left, voting for New Deal Democrats, and building a strong union movement. As to the current generation, there are no parties of the left to speak of, but a Pew Poll from late 2011 found that 49 percent of Americans under 30 had a positive view of socialism (against 43 percent negative), while just 46 percent had a positive view of capitalism (against 47 percent negative). Young people couldn't find any New Deal Democrats to vote for, but they clearly favored Barack Obama in the last two presidential elections.

Meyerson tells us the unions have taken notice and are considering how to take ground. The AFL-CIO is considering allowing non-union-members to join and creating an ""omnibus organization,"" which could then push for living wages and other issues of concern to working people, such as education costs and student debt loads.

The problem of course that the unions have so long allowed themselves to be abused by the Democratic party that I'm skeptical that they are capable of redemption. But the poll results say that there's plenty of room for a political force on the left if there were a way to organize it. And the idea that it has to be through a formal party structure is overdone. Unions were brought into the Democratic party not to give them a seat at the table but to domesticate them. But can the unions to divorce the Democrats and reinvent themselves? It's a tall order, and I sense they",0.0,0.7191539754013478,-1.4000000000000001,-0.1

256073,True,450,"Millions of people took to the streets of Paris and cities across France on Sunday to rally in defense of free speech and against terrorism in the wake of Wednesday's deadly attack on satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo. The French Interior Ministry told the Associated Press that 3.7 million marched throughout France, making the demonstrations the largest in the country's history.

Adding to the symbolic weight of the demonstrations, more than 40 world leaders joined the start of the Paris march, linking arms in an act of solidarity. But as Reporters Without Borders points out, their policies at home are far from compatible with the solidarity for free speech on display throughout France.

The organization said Sunday that it was ""appalled by the presence of leaders from countries where journalists and bloggers are systematically persecuted such as Egypt (which is ranked 159th out of 180 countries in RWB's press freedom index), Russia (148th), Turkey (154th) and United Arab Emirates (118th).""

""We must demonstrate our solidarity with Charlie Hebdo without forgetting all the world's other Charlies,"" Reporters Without Borders Secretary-General Christophe Deloire said in a statement. ""It would be unacceptable if representatives of countries that silence journalists were to take advantage of the current outpouring of emotion to try to improve their international image and then continue their repressive policies when they return home. We must not let predators of press freedom spit on the graves of Charlie Hebdo.""

They're right. In what can only be described as an epic series of 21 pointed tweets, London School for Economics Middle East Society co-president Daniel Wickham points out that many of the world leaders who marched Sunday through the streets of Paris are not the world's biggest advocates for press freedom.

These tweets point out the hypocrisy of government solidarity with Charlie Hebdo.

""Politicians worldwide are enacting a slew of laws to impinge on free speech, but are the first to defend it when there's a body count,"" writes the Daily Beast's Luke O'Neil. ""It is grandstanding for a right rarely protected unless under immediate attack.""

There were a few glimpses into the their booth during the TV broadcast, (watch the full song at the end of the article). At first glance appeared to just be a stage set – but then overnight we were linked to a photo gallery by Hollywood prop-specialist Jim Logiudice showing the set being built.

Look closely at the knob layout – Daft Punk is up to their old tricks, building in what appear to be 14 Behringer BCR-2000s (a nearly 8-year-old product now) into their set. In the image below we've superimposed a BCR-2000 so you can see for yourself how the control layout matches up:

Jim writes in his description of the photo gallery:


This mid-century modern style set was designed by Daft Arts. Check out the old school audio equipment integrated into the set. Very cool. The recording booth is patterned after the 'Mother' space craft control room from the movie Alien. The robots gold mirror mixing console actually worked and was played live.

As with most Grammy performances, there's likely a fair amount of the performances that are controlled and not performed live. Considering how live most of the elements of this particular song were, we'd be willing to bet that the robot duo were at least triggering samples and loops onstage.

255094,True,378,"Opened two years ago in Neuschonau, Bavaria, in Germany, the tree-top walk is the longest of it's kind at 1300 meters that takes you to an impressive height of 25 meters above the tree tops. The walkway ends at an oval shaped dome, 44 meters high. The 360-degree spiral staircase around the dome offers breathtaking views of the surrounding nature. In clear weather you can even see the north ridge of the Alps. The tree-top walk is a part of the largest protected forest area in central Europe – Bavarian Forest National Park, which is also the first national park in Germany.

The tree-top walk, Baumwipfelpfad in German, begins with a short elevator ride or stair climb to the ticket booth, a mere 8 meter above the parking lot. As hikers begin the leisurely walk down a 1300-meter long wood path, the ground begins to gently fall away -- or so it appears -- as the path inclines almost imperceptibly, making it easily accessible for parents with strollers. It is obvious the creators of the Baumwipfelpfad wanted to make visitors feel a part of the natural environment. The path advances freely through the forest, leaving the mature pines forever undisturbed.

Several adventure stations are placed along the walkway including a narrow wooden plank enticing hardy trekkers to balance on the beam. These obstacles are fully-enclosed with a safety net and offers a rewarding view of the earth 50 feet below. The observation dome is shaped like a giant egg. Once at the top, a spectacular view awaits the visitors.

At the 2008 Child Neurology Society meeting in San Jose, California, I presented six children with a unique syndrome I called ""Exorcist Syndrome""


1. Hyperacute onset - parents point to hour of change

2. Ballistic tics - forceful, unrestrained, violent - can put holes in walls, etc.

3. Disinhibition - expletives, capable of serious physical harm to self or others

4. ""Falsetto"" vocal change - voice is clear, no aphasia but change in quality of voice - gruff/demonic, Bugs Bunny, infantile

5. Symptoms seem to turn on and off like a switch. At times appear completely normal, then symptoms above suddenly rage.


These previously normal children acquire this illness suddenly and appear to be demonically possessed. It is not an encephalitis or encephalopathy as the sensorium remains clear, there is no significant cognitive dysfunction.


Every one of these children was fully alert, could recall the episode entirely. Video EEG normal in all.

MRI was not done in all, but where done show significant reversible basal ganglia swelling

LP was not done in all, but where done was normal.

No antibiotics or meds (such as neuroleptics) helped significantly. IVIG works - but loses effect in 2-3 weeks. Only PEX produces lasting changes

So the lowdown is don't putz around with antibiotics or drugs, go straight to the big immunosuppressive guns.


What causes it? You guessed it ....

Every one of these kids have SKY HIGH strep markers, ASO 800-1000 range, anti-DNAase B >1:2720. At this time, I wasn't thinking about other PANDAS triggers .... these children were never tested for Mycoplasma or other triggers


In my view, this is the most severe PANDAS variant and is a neuropsychiatric quasi-emergency due to the risk of violence. It's a central catecholaminergic storm ...


We never measured Cunnigham panel on these kids, but I'll bet they show anti-neurotransmitter receptor antibodies.


If left alone, it resolves spontaneously in months-years. Resolution is often sudden.


Amazingly, outcome is excellent. Cognitive ability is preserved. This is one of the reasons why I believe the outcome in PANDAS, long-term, is good.",0.5851809203414428,0.6851809203414427,-0.1,0.0
257106,True,611,"US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson (pictured above left) began his first Asian tour on Wednesday, holding talks with Japan's Foreign Minister Fumio Kishida (above right) before a scheduled meeting with Prime Minister Shinzo Abe.

""Trilateral cooperation is critical as we address the issue of North Korea,"" Tillerson told Kishida. ""It is critical in particular as we address North Korea's nuclear and ballistic missiles programs,"" he added.

US officials have become concerned by North Korea's accelerating progress towards building an intercontinental ballistic missile that could reach US mainland cities.

President Donald Trump caused anxiety during his election campaign by suggesting US allies Japan and South Korea need to do more to defend themselves. But since taking office he has been careful to offer full support, a message that Tillerson reiterated, saying the US and Japan had an ""unwavering bond.""

""The US-Japan alliance remains the cornerstone of peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific region,"" Tillerson told Kishida, also stressing the importance of three-way cooperation with South Korea.

Japan and South Korea both host tens of thousands of US troops.

This week, the nations' three navies conducted missile defense information-sharing drills in the region.

Kishida, meanwhile, thanked Tillerson for US backing. ""I highly value the fact that you chose Japan as your first place to visit in Asia,"" he said, adding that it indicates the ""importance"" the US attaches to the relationship.

Tillerson travels to South Korea on Friday, before heading to China on Saturday, where he is expected to press China to help restrain North Korea.

China in loop

State Department spokesman Mark Toner told reporters this week that efforts to convince China to pressure North Korea were the ""looming challenge"" in trans-Pacific relations. ""He's going to have an opportunity at every stop to talk about next steps or what we do now, with respect to North Korea,"" he said.

In a news conference on Wednesday, China's Premier Li Keqiang said ""there are bright prospects for China-US cooperation."" This after recent comments in which China's Foreign Minister Wang Yi implied the US and North Korea were equally at fault and moving towards a ""head-on collision.""

Washington and Beijing have clashed in recent months over developments in the South China Sea, where the Chinese have been seen by the US as flexing their military and diplomatic muscles.

Meanwhile, the Chinese government is concerned about Washington's decision to deploy the THAAD missile defense program in South Korea.

Washington insists THAAD is a defensive system deployed to protect the South and US bases, but China fears its advanced radar system undermines China's nuclear deterrent.

Protests

A small group of American expats protested outside the US embassy in Tokyo, demanding former ExxonMobil chief executive Tillerson respect the Paris climate change accord.

Unlike the kings and queens he'd been working, this particular box didn't give any information as to the identity of the stiff inside. Even stranger, the body was wrapped in sheepskin, which was considered unclean by ancient Egyptians. When he finally opened the coffin, Maspero found himself even more shocked. he found this screaming, undead face looking back at him.

wrapped in a sheep or goatskin – a ritually unclean object for ancient Egyptians – lay the body of a young man, his face locked in an eternal blood-curdling scream. It was a spine-tingling sight, and one that posed even more troubling questions: here was a mummy, carefully preserved, yet caught in the moment of death in apparently excruciating pain.

Called both ""Unknown Man E"" and the ""Screaming Mummy"" because of his open jaw and agonized expression, the mummy has baffled researchers since it was first uncovered. Experts theorized that the body had been poisoned, buried alive or otherwise tortured before his untimely death.

He had been buried in exalted company, yet been left without an inscription, ensuring he would be consigned to eternal damnation, as the ancient Egyptians believed identity was the key to entering the afterlife. Moreover, his hands and feet had been so tightly bound that marks still remained on the bones.

since Unknown Man E, there have been several more ""screaming"" mummies found in various digs all around the world. Mummies with their mouths agape or lips pulled back as if they are screaming or writhing in pain are truly startling. Two of the most famous–designated Unknown Woman A and Unknown Man E. Such mummies, however, are found not just in Egypt but worldwide, in Palermo, Sicily, Guanajuato, Mexico, and in Peru. Some of these bodies were purposefully preserved, though by various methods, while others are natural or, you might say, accidental mummies.

255761,False,1024,"Republicans like to think of themselves as the party of ""personal responsibility,"" The phrase props up repeatedly on conservative websites listing what their supposed values are. In his infamous, supposed-to-be-private, ""47 percent"" speech to wealthy donors in 2012, Mitt Romney notoriously declared, in reference to Obama voters, that he'll ""never convince them that they should take personal responsibility and care for their lives.""

In 2014, Ted Cruz tried to justify cutting people off from food assistance by saying, ""Instead of locking people into an endless cycle of dependence, we should be focused on making it easier for people to stand on their own feet by getting this weak economy booming."" (A fallacious assertion, as food aid both helps people get on their feet and is by far one of the most cost-effective ways to stimulate the economy.)

But what's become quite clear in recent months is that, for conservatives, ""personal responsibility"" is for other people. Conservatives love shaming genuinely responsible Americans because they occasionally need some help in hard times, but when asked to take responsibility for stuff that is actually their responsibility to take, conservatives will, more often than not, scream bloody murder.

The most recent example is Ted Cruz, who is a master class in avoiding personal responsibility. Cruz has been running around claiming that the reason he doesn't have health insurance right now for his family is because of Obamacare. The actual reason is that he's irresponsible.

Back in July, Cruz's insurer decided to eliminate PPO plans in favor of HMO-only plans and gave policy holders a whopping five months to make the switch if they wanted to. Cruz apparently just forgot to do it, and now his family is scrambling. But rather than admit that he made a mistake and failed his family, Cruz is blaming the Affordable Care Act, as if no insurance company prior to the ACA ever did anything like adjust their rates or change the insurance options.

""By the way, when you let your health insurance policy lapse, your wife gets really ticked at you,"" Cruz cracked at a campaign stop. Ladies are always nagging, am I right, fellas? Sure, Cruz thinks your kids should be hung out to starve if you lose your job due to layoffs that are not fault of your own, but if he just forgets to sign up for health insurance for five whole months, well, don't be some kind of drag. It's all Obama's fault, anyway!

There's a reason that ""Thanks, Obama"" so quickly became an ironic expression liberals used to poke fun at conservatives who love blaming the president for their problems when the real culprit is usually best seen in a mirror. But what's sad is that Cruz blaming Obama for his own failure to use that five-month window to sign up for health insurance is that it wasn't even the worst example from that week of this phenomenon.

No, that prize goes to Sarah Palin. Her son, Track Palin, was arrested on charges of domestic violence last week and rather than blaming her son for his choices or herself for bad parenting, Palin decided to blame, yes, Obama.

""When my own son is going through what he goes through coming back, I can certainly relate to other families who feel these ramifications of PTSD… our soldiers do return with.

Sarah Palin in particular likes to hold out her family as the icons of said responsible gun owners who are clearly just so full of responsibility that it's downright unholy to suggest they might ever do anything less than noble and totally responsible with their guns.

You know, right up until one of them gets arrested for allegedly waving one around, while drunk, while also allegedly kicking and punching his girlfriend.

The notion that we should respect the rights of ""responsible"" gun owners would be more compelling if there was a single indication that conservatives are actually cultivating responsibility within their ranks, especially on the issue of firearm use.

3 A Woman Can Never Be Likable Enough

The largest trade associations have been around for nearly a century, and in the last few decades, many have taken an international scope. For instance, the American Petroleum Institute, which began in 1919 as a trade group for domestic oil companies, is now led in part by a Saudi government lobbyist and has offices in Singapore, Beijing and Dubai. ExxonMobil and Chevron are reportedly among the highest dues-paying members of API, but so is Aramco, the state-owned Saudi oil company. (The American Petroleum Institute, as Bloomberg has reported, now transfers money to attack ad groups like the 60 Plus Association.)

Here's the rub. Citizens United allows trade associations, for the first time, to dip into their general treasuries—made up in many cases of both foreign and domestic money from businesses—and spend unlimited amounts on American elections. Before the Supreme Court began taking an axe to campaign finance, if a trade association wanted to spend on a federal election, it had to spin off a regulated and disclosed political action committee. Though foreigners can't manage a PAC, they are more than welcome to manage major trade associations like the American Petroleum Institute.

Here's how it plays out this year.

Chemical companies do not want Tammy Baldwin, the Democratic Senate candidate in Wisconsin, to win. In addition to voting to move our energy system towards a clean economy and away from petrochemicals, she's a strong advocate for regulating carcinogens in household products, like cosmetics. But instead of beating her with an ordinary PAC or a campaign contribution to her opponent, the trade association for the chemical industry has chosen to take advantage of the Citizens United loophole to use undisclosed general treasury funds against Baldwin.

The American Chemistry Council made one of the biggest media buys in the Senate race in August by purchasing $648,600 worth of ads supporting Baldwin's opponent, former Republican Governor Tommy Thompson. Here's the ad:

The American Chemistry Council used its 501(c)(6) fund rather than its PAC, so it does not have to disclose where it got that money. The council has also used its 501(c)(6) to air ads in support of Senator Joe Manchin (D-WV) and other pro-chemical industry politicians of both parties.

Where does the Chemistry Council's general treasury, otherwise known as its 501(c)(6), receive its funds? Well, according to its website, the largest foreign chemical companies in the world—Saudi Arabia's state-owned SABIC, the Chinese-owned Sinopec corporation and Japan's Mitsubishi Chemical Corporation—are dues-paying members, alongside American giants like DuPont and Dow Chemical.

The American Petroleum Institute also used its foreign-funded 501(c)(6) to air its own ads against senators like McCaskill.

In some rare cases, subsidiaries of foreign-owned corporations have decided to skip the trade association route and spend disclosed dollars on US elections. Recently, OdysseyRe, a subsidiary of a Canadian financial services company, gave $1 million to the pro-Romney Super PAC. As I reported earlier this year, 7-Eleven Corporation, which is owned by a Japanese holding company, gave to a Super PAC supporting Senator Dick Lugar (R-IN) during his primary.

When the next Congress is gaveled in this January, a good number of lawmakers will owe their seats to groups financed in part by foreign-owned corporations. In the case of the American Chemistry Council and American Petroleum Institute, two Saudi-funded pro-oil lobbies active in the election, that could have wide ranging ramifications for our energy security.

257685,True,832,"'The Rock' Reps U.S. Army-Licensed Clothing Line

Military chic is so hot right now. It was only a matter of time before the actual military caught on.

Last week, Elle informed its readers that military inspired style was making a comeback — in the words of the magazine, ""North Korea chic."" Thanks to the good people at the Authentic Apparel Group, average Joes can now stay on trend with a new U.S. Army-licensed clothing line available exclusively on Zappos.com. It's the first time the U.S. Army has extended its brand to an original line of consumer clothing and, surprisingly, it doesn't disappoint. Neither does its spokes person model: Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson, who has signed on as the public face of the clothing line.

For now, the 42-item collection is limited to menswear, and includes pants, shirts, sweaters, hoodies, jackets and coats. According to Authentic Apparel, each garment was individually approved by the U.S. Army, ensuring that the clothing line meets the rigorous standards of the largest and oldest branch of the U.S. military. In other words, these clothes are rugged enough to withstand even The Rock's rough-and-tumble lifestyle (he does most of his own stunts, you know).

Most of the items in the line — bomber jackets, khakis, henleys, etc. — originated as military uniform, but are now common to civilian wardrobes. In an ironic effort to render them more ""authentic,"" the company added field and dress details like kevlar threading and epaulets. The occasion underscores both the public's boundless appetite for military-inspired garb, and the surprising extent to which military accoutrement has already been absorbed into popular culture.

Wristwatches, for example, were a military tool during World War I, when the U.S. Army used them to synchronize precision attacks (they were easier to consult than the more ubiquitous pocket watches). Similarly, RayBan aviators were designed for U.S. Air Force pilots in the 1930s, as a way to prevent headaches and altitude sickness caused by sun glare. They became a household a name two decades later, when Hollywood's leading men adopted them as an accessory. Trench coats were developed for the British Army in the 19th century, and took their name from the grimy trenches in which soldiers fought and died during World War I. Even the iconic Burberry trench has military roots: In 1901, Thomas Burberry submitted to the British War Office an officer's raincoat design made with his own proprietary water-resistant fabric.

And khakis, now a staple of casual menswear, were a product of colonial India. In 1846, a British district officer in charge of a troop in Peshawar realized that the soldiers' white cotton uniforms proved easy targets for snipers. So, his troops began dying their uniform with tea (or mud, depending on whom you ask), to better blend in with their surroundings. Ten years later, the Magistrate of Meerut, a city in Utter Pradesh, adapted this discovery and formed the Khaki Risala, or ""Dusty Squadron."" Since then, khaki has trickled down to every branch of the U.S. Armed Forces.

The U.S. Army has licensed all kinds of products, including electronics, toys, and camping gear, but this is its first notable foray in fashion (hopefully not the last). While some soldiers might turn up their noses at the notion, there is an upside for them: By federal law, licensing fees from all branded products must benefit the Morale, Welfare, and Recreation Program, which provides social and educational services to soldiers, retirees, and their families. For some, that may be a pleasing alternative to lining the pockets of high fashion designers, whose military-inspired peacoats and trousers aren't even sewn with kevlar thread.",0.6109332907563048,0.7109332907563047,-0.1,0.0
257506,True,876,"German Chancellor Angela Merkel | Sean Gallup/Getty Images Angela Merkel: refugee policy misunderstood, not mistaken The AfD is on its way to the Bundestag, while the CDU will lose influence in Germany's upper house.

BERLIN — Angela Merkel responded to her Christian Democrats' (CDU) serious setback in Berlin state elections by acknowledging shortcomings in how she communicated her refugee policy — but not in the policy itself.

In Sunday's election, both Merkel's CDU and the Social Democrats (SPD), Germany's second-largest party, plummeted, while the anti-immigrant Alternative for Germany (AfD) made huge gains. Founded only three years ago, the AfD now has seats in 10 of the 16 German state assemblies. It took over 14 percent of votes cast in the capital.

The chancellor stood by her decision a year ago to let hundreds of thousands of asylum seekers, many fleeing the war in Syria, into German — a policy that has put the AfD on course to enter the Bundestag, or lower house of parliament, in next year's national election.

""If one of the reasons for the bad performance of the CDU is that the direction, aim and the underlying conviction of our refugee policy were not sufficiently explained to some people, I would like to put more effort into this,"" Merkel said in a press conference on Monday.

""The reasons [for Sunday's election setback] lie in state politics, but not exclusively,"" said the CDU leader. ""I am the head of this party, and I certainly don't evade responsibility.""

Merkel, whose support is taking a battering ahead of next year's election, has also renounced her year-old mantra ""We can do it"" — her defiant response to those who doubted the country could cope with the influx of refugees, which continued until a few weeks ago.

""The sentence is part of my political work, it's the expression of its stance and its aim,"" Merkel said. ""Much has been interpreted into this … sentence. So much that I hardly want to repeat it,"" she said, adding that it had been widely misunderstood and turned into an ""empty phrase.""

""The discussion around it has become an ever-more-unproductive loop. Some felt provoked by the sentence, and I never intended that,"" she said.

The CDU has come under constant criticism since the refugee crisis began from its more conservative Bavarian sister party, the Christian Social Union (CSU). Members of Merkel's party blame the CSU for the CDU's election setbacks in Berlin and earlier this month in the northeastern state of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, where Merkel has her constituency.

""[CSU chief Horst Seehofer] left no stone unturned in trying to run the CDU down,"" said Karl-Georg Wellmann, a CDU lawmaker in the Bundestag, on German radio Monday.

The CDU looks likely to be excluded from power-sharing in the Berlin state assembly, where the SPD will need two other partners — probably the Greens and far-left Linke — to govern the capital. More seriously, the result will diminish CDU's already limited influence in the Bundesrat, or upper house of the German parliament, where the federal states are represented.

Speaking about the rise of the AfD, Merkel said on Monday she felt unable to deploy facts against the far-right party's appeal to insecurity and angst.

""I, myself, would like to respond to it with a feeling I have,"" she said, using uncharacteristically emotional language. ""I have the feeling we will emerge from these complicated times stronger than before… Who, if not us, should be capable of making something good out of this?""

British Prime Minister Theresa May on Monday spoke out against ""uncontrolled migration.""

Speaking before the U.N. General Assembly in New York, May said: ""I think that uncontrolled migration is not in the interests of the migrants themselves, it's not in the interests of refugees — who may find that they see less support as a result — it's not in the interests of the countries that people are coming from, traveling through or trying to get to.""",0.7675725704645502,0.7675725704645502,0.0,0.0

258664,False,1024,"(CNN) -- There was no profanity, no hate. Just the words, ""I love my friends Abby and Faith. Lex was here 2/1/10 :)"" scrawled on the classroom desk with a green marker.

Alexa Gonzalez, an outgoing 12-year-old who likes to dance and draw, expected a lecture or maybe detention for her doodles earlier this month. Instead, the principal of the Junior High School in Forest Hills, New York, called police, and the seventh-grader was taken across the street to the police precinct.

Alexa's hands were cuffed behind her back, and tears gushed as she was escorted from school in front of teachers and -- the worst audience of all for a preadolescent girl -- her classmates.

""They put the handcuffs on me, and I couldn't believe it,"" Alexa recalled. ""I didn't want them to see me being handcuffed, thinking I'm a bad person.""

Alexa is no longer facing suspension, according a spokeswoman for the New York City Department of Education. Still, the case of the doodling preteen is raising concerns about the use of zero tolerance policies in schools.

Critics say schools and police have gone too far, overreacting and using well-intended rules for incidents involving nonviolent offenses such as drawing on desks, writing on other school property or talking back to teachers.

""We are arresting them at younger and younger ages [in cases] that used to be covered with a trip to the principal's office, not sending children to jail,"" said Emma Jordan-Simpson, executive director of the Children's Defense Fund, a national children's advocacy group.

There aren't any national studies documenting how often minors become involved with police for nonviolent crimes in schools. Tracking the incidents depends on how individual schools keep records. Much of the information remains private, since it involves juveniles.

But one thing is sure: Alexa's case isn't the first in the New York area. One of the first cases to gain national notoriety was that of Chelsea Fraser. In 2007, the 13-year-old wrote ""Okay"" on her desk, and police handcuffed and arrested her. She was one of several students arrested in the class that day; the others were accused of plastering the walls with stickers.

At schools across the country, police are being asked to step in. In November, a food fight at a middle school in Chicago, Illinois, resulted in the arrests of 25 children, some as young as 11, according to the Chicago Police Department.

The Strategy Center, a California-based civil rights group that tracks zero tolerance policies, found that at least 12,000 tickets were issued to tardy or truant students by Los Angeles Police Department and school security officers in 2008. The tickets tarnished students' records and brought them into the juvenile court system, with fines of up to $250 for repeat offenders.

The Strategy Center opposes the system. ""The theory is that if we fine them, then they won't be late again,"" said Manuel Criollo, lead organizer of the ""No to Pre-Prison"" campaign at The Strategy Center. ""But they just end up not going to school at all.""

His group is trying to stop the LAPD and the school district from issuing the tickets. The Los Angeles School District says the policy is designed to reduce absenteeism.

And another California school -- Highland High School in Palmdale -- found that issuing tardiness tickets drastically cut the number of pupils being late for class and helped tone down disruptive behavior. The fifth ticket issued landed a student in juvenile traffic court.

In 1998, New York City took its zero tolerance policies to the next level, placing school security officers under the New York City Police Department. Today, there are nearly 5,000 employees in the NYPD School Safety Division. Most are not police officers, but that number exceeds the total police force in Washington, D.C.

In contrast, there are only about 3,000 counselors in New York City's public school system. Critics of zero tolerance policies say more attention should be paid to social work, counseling and therapy.

""Instead of a graduated discipline approach, we see ... expulsions at the drop of a hat,"" said Donna Lieberman, an attorney with the New York branch of the American Civil Liberties Union.

""If they have been suspended once, their likelihood of being pushed out of the school increases,"" she said. ""They may end up in jail at some point in their life.""

One of Lieberman's clients was in sixth grade when police arrested her in 2007 for doodling with her friend in class. The child, called M.M. in court filings to protect her identity, tried to get tissues to remove the marks, a complaint states.

Lieberman says police subjected M.M. to unlawful search and seizure. A class-action lawsuit, filed in January",0.6929618650164747,0.7929618650164747,-0.1,0.0
255678,True,902,"DETROIT - Detroit Red Wings coach Mike Babcock might have been exaggerating slightly when speaking about his team's record in Philadelphia.

""I don't think we've won in Philly since Christ was a kid,"" Babcock said.

It only seems like that. The Red Wings have lost eight consecutive games in Philadelphia, getting outscored 33-13, since winning there when it mattered the most - in Games 1 and 2 of the 1997 Stanley Cup finals en route to a sweep.

They'll have another chance Saturday at Wells Fargo Center (7 p.m., Fox Sports Detroit) and will turn to backup goaltender Jonas Gustavsson in an effort to snap the streak.

Gustavsson, who turned 30 on Friday, made 30 saves in a 1-0 overtime victory over Toronto last Saturday, his lone appearance thus far.

""It's going to be a new challenge,"" Gustavsson said. ""I put that (first win) behind me and I'm going to go out there and do my best.

""It's always good to get the games in; that's when you learn, gain experience. You try to take advantage of the practices, too.""

The Red Wings (4-1-2) rank fourth in the NHL in goals-against average (1.66) and are the only team that hasn't allowed a power-play goal (21-for-21).

Jimmy Howard has been their best penalty killer but will get a break Saturday, watching in the only building he said he has never played in.

""Howie's never played there?"" Babcock said.

Then he turned to Howard, who was sitting in his stall, and said, ""Howie, you're not getting to play in Philly, buddy! I didn't know that. ... Maybe that's why we never win there.""

Since their last regular season victory in Philadelphia on Jan. 25, 1997, with Mike Vernon in goal (also the starter in the Cup finals that year), the Red Wings have started four goalies in Philly - Chris Osgood (0-4), Joey MacDonald (0-2), Curtis Joseph (0-1) and Gustavsson (0-1).

Detroit's all-time regular season record there is 13-38-11 (W-L-T).

The Flyers (2-3-2) historically have been a big, physical team that likes to rough it up, especially at home. Asked if they still play like that, Red Wings defenseman Jonathan Ericsson said, ""Maybe not as much, but I think they still have that mentality. That's the Philly way of playing.""

But, he added, ""You need to have some quickness on your team. If you have big guys you usually don't get the quickness at the same time. I think they have a good mixture there but probably not as many hard-hitting big guys anymore.""

The Flyers' blue line is banged up. Braydon Coburn and Andrew MacDonald are out four weeks with lower-body injuries and Kimmo Timonen is out until at least January with blood clots.

They're led up front by Claude Giroux, Jakub Voracek and Wayne Simmonds.

""I watched them the other night (5-3 win at Pittsburgh); I thought they played real well, real solid through the neutral zone,"" Babcock said. ""I think their power play is impressive, they got the puck back. I was really impressed with Simmonds, I thought he had a heck of a game. The (Sean) Couturier line was solid. I didn't know who (Pierre-Edouard) Bellemare, their second line center, was but he looks like a good player. They've got good depth up front. They look like a real good team. We'll have our hands full.

""We've got to get started and compete. We had a heck of a win (Thursday, 4-3 in overtime over Pittsburgh), really stuck with it and found a way to get a win. We want to build off of it.""

255779,True,436,"Do you have fond memories of playing the 2005 version of Star Wars: Battlefront 2? Do you wish with every fiber of your being that it had official online servers again? Well then, good news: your wish just came true, somehow.


On both Steam and GOG, the PC version of the original Battlefront 2 has been updated with 64-player online multiplayer support and crossplay, so that you can battle or just front (if you're not good at battling but want people to believe you are) with friends on either platform.


While Disney, the game's current publisher, didn't say precisely why it decided to do this, odds are good that it's a promotional thing for Star Wars: Battlefront II, EA's new-gen Battlefront game that's coming out next month and having a beta this week. It's a pretty neat promotional thing, though, given how much people adore the first Battlefront 2, which is regarded by some as the best multiplayer Star Wars ever.


Battlefront 2's return, however, has so far been less a Return of the Jedi triumph and more an Empire Strikes Back series of unfortunate events. As of now, most players are complaining that they can't actually connect to the new multiplayer servers, likely because they're swamped. This makes sense given that, in the past 24 hours, the game has jumped from having a few hundred concurrent players to thousands.


It's also a bit darkly humorous that Disney decided to resurrect this game ahead of EA's Battlefront II, seeing as it's given rise to a renewed chorus of chants about how much more people liked the first two Battlefront games than EA and DICE's reboot. Here, for instance, is the current top review on the Steam version of Battlefront 2:

Back then, although it couldn't remind you to take out the trash or compose text messages, it offered a lot of the same search functionality it does today.

In fact, according to Steve Wozniak, Siri was actually better back then.

During a recent interview with The Times Union, Wozniak, who co-founded Apple with Steve Jobs, said that he has been ""disappointed"" by Siri since Apple's acquisition. He knew Siri would be ""the future,"" but he says the service broke the day Apple took over.

He does admit, however, that Siri has improved since it was integrated into iOS:

Then when Apple finally released it, it still had a lot of those problems, but you know… it should be smart enough to look at the words you say and know what you're asking.

You can watch the interview below, just excuse the wind.

This isn't the first time Woz has revealed his frustrations with Siri since it became an Apple product. In fact, back in January, he said his Android device handles voice commands better than his iPhone does:

I'll be saying, over and over again in my car, ""Call the Lark Creek Steak House,"" and I can't get it done. Then I pick up my Android, say the same thing, and it's done.

Of course, Siri is still in beta, and Apple continues to improve it. It has already announced new features for iOS 6, so you can be sure that the feature will get better over time. But right now, it seems it's not for everyone.

As a devout library lover in my youth, though finding very little reason to visit in my older years (and actually feeling sad about this) due to largely to lack of reading time... this was a fun book to read. It does its job of making libraries seem exciting, and full of awesomeness. The writer expresses the loves that are close to all library-lover's hearts: books, collecting books, organizing books, reading book, knowing about books and the stuff we found in books -- oh and all that other media and stuff as well. She expresses this while describing the struggles, experiments, and changes made in libraries in these internet times.


As a fairly adept computer/database programmer and all-around ""IT"" guy, and developer of a web site that currently gets about 500,000 unique visits per month, I felt that she could have used the thing she stresses many times in the book that libraries need now: competent computer/IT consulting/staff. Pretty much every library computer/web interface I've seen (in Canada) has sucked extremely badly. Excusing this by saying these companies who supply these systems (and horrifically expensive prices) were the only ones capable of handling such large collections at the time is just ridiculous to those of us who have some knowledge of these things. Excusing great mystery of the missing holds as finally (after how long?!) as being not the fault of the software, but of the librarians, equally misdiagnoses the problem. Were there no simple audit trails? Do the developers have no respect for data integrity?!!! Excusing this on having to interface with or work on top of legacy systems and structures, while certainly a consideration and a constraint, does not seem credible to me.


It's truly broken my heart to see the crap my beloved libraries have installed, and tied themselves to. And continue to. The IT consultants they seem to end up with these days seem more to be sales people --- selling them a bill of goods. A short term we-want-to-be-hip-and-up-to-date solution tied to specific devices, or pathetic DRM schemes.


And the length of time the author spends in Second Life is, to me, also rather startling. She does mention the lag and glitches. But she doesn't mention the relatively steep learning curve and hardware requirements just for entry. She describes the scenes she participates in that world with beautiful imagination: the (virtual) reality is vastly (if not infinitely) more clunky. Yeah, it's interesting and fun that a group of librarians have gravitated there and done interesting things... but Second Life is rather rather old technology by this point, which never really took off as expected: it's a niche of which you can say at least it did better than all of the other ""revolutionary"" virtual reality environments that were supposed to change the way we interacted with computers. Admittedly it's been years since I looked at it, and frankly I felt like I had entered a time machine and gone back about five years to hear such glowing reviews of it in this book. Five years!


I was more interested in the social activism side of librarians; and some of the history of library initiatives was quite interesting.


Lately, though I have no ""information systems"" training, I have found myself helping a local non-profit organization (for free) get their old, approximately 2000 volume, card catalog into a computer. I set up Koha for them (an excellent, free, open-source, library software -- even if it feels a bit hodge-podge) and wrote up documentation on the cataloging process, and circulation. Actually I've ended up doing the input for 1500 of the volumes myself in my spare time over the last year. I've become very familiar with MARC (in it's various flavours), Z39.50, worldcat, and related things.


I've also become rather intimate with the blessed cards, and all their peculiarities. Notes written on them by librarians 20 years ago which are now indecipherable. At several points the cart catalog was gone through and a system of small lines, dots or checkmarks were added to the corners of cards indicate some sort of status. No one really remembers what the marks meant -- and what they do remember no one knows if the information is still valid. There are professinionally printed cards with LCC numbers.

256637,False,1024,"Chapter 700: The Flood Dragon Bandits

""Currently, the great elders of my Tianqin clan have already gone to Coiled Dragon Mountain to negotiate with the boss of the Flood Dragon Bandits in attempt to save Qin Qin. But we don't know what the outcome is, and if the negotiation fails, Qin Qin will…"" Reaching the end, the patriarch of the Tianqin clan secretly sighed. The Flood Dragon Bandits were so strong that even the Zhuya Kingdom did not dare to casually provoke them, so if the negotiation failed, Qin Qin could only be forced into marriage with the son of the Flood Dragon Bandits' boss.

Qin Xiao suddenly stood up and said, ""No, we have to save sister no matter what. She definitely can't marry the son of that bandit boss, or her life will be completely ruined.""

""Xiao'er, sit down. You need to understand the current situation. How can you be so hot-headed and attempt to do something above your abilities? If you act recklessly, you'll pull the Tianqin clan into eternal damnation."" The patriarch of the Tianqin clan swiftly looked at Qin Xiao and scolded him with a low voice. Qin Xiao's position as the future patriarch of the Tianqin clan was something already established, so he did not allow his son to be so hot-headed.

""Father, do we really have to watch sister getting married to a bandit while we can't do anything?"" Qin Xiao refuted unrelentingly.

The patriarch sighed, ""Xiao'er, don't worry right now. The great elders have already headed to Coiled Dragon Mountain for negotiations and should return very soon. Who knows, perhaps there is still chance to save Qin Qin.""

As soon as he finished speaking, Jian Chen felt two powerful presences approach the Tianqin clan from far away. In the end, they entered the Tianqin clan, heading directly for the hall.

Jian Chen saw two elderly but ruddy men in long white robes walk in. On their faces, they revealed a sliver of helplessness and regret mixed in with some anger.

All the high-ranking members of the Tianqin clan sitting in the hall stood up and clasped their hands respectfully at the two great elders, ""We greet the great elders!""

Jian Chen sat without moving in his seat and gazed indifferently at the two great elder. He was unfamiliar with the two great elders as neither of them were the person who had accompanied them to Mercenary City.

""Two great elders, I wonder how the negotiations went. Were the Flood Dragon Bandits willing to release my sister?"" Qin Xiao stared at the two great elders anxiously. The two of them carried all the hope there was.

A great elder shook his head, ""The boss of the Flood Dragon Bandits is determined in making Qin Qin marry his son. Even with the generous request we had mentioned, they were unwilling.""

Qin Xiao began to become gloomy. He clenched his fists tightly and fumed with gritted teeth, ""Since the Flood Dragon Bandits are unwilling to let my sister go, we have to make them pay a big price.""

""The third elder has already gone to contact other experts. Perhaps he can convince them to join forces with us and fight the Flood Dragon Bandits. If we raise enough power, we can try fighting with the bandits."" The patriarch of the Tianqin clan said softly.

When the Flood Dragon Bandits had kidnapped an immediate member of the Tianqin clan to marry with the bandit's son, it was basically slapping the Tianqin clan in the face. If the marriage really did happen, just what dignity would the Tianqin clan still possess to remain established in Walaurent City?

""I reckon third elder will definitely return with failure. The experts of the surrounding countries know exactly how strong the boss of the Flood Dragon Bandits are. Why would anybody risk their lives to offend the bandit boss?"" A great elder sighed lightly.

At this moment, another powerful presence flew towards the Tianqin clan from far away, arriving at the hall not long after. The newcomer was also an elderly, ruddy man in long white robes. He was the Heaven Saint Master that had accompanied Jian Chen to Mercenary City.

As soon as he entered the hall, he sighed. With a helpless expression, he said, ""I've already contacted the Heaven Saint Masters of several large clans. They all fear the boss of the Flood Dragon Bandits, so they're unwilling to work with us in handling the bandits. Looks like this time, our Tianqin clan really will have to just accept the humiliation.""

Hearing what was said, everyone in the hall became gloomy.

258509,False,1024,"The collapse of the Indian rupee is just the first of many financial crises that the US Federal Reserve may well trigger with the unwinding of its stimulus policy. Since 2008, the Fed has cut interest rates to zero and tripled its balance sheet. The duration and magnitude of the stimulus is unprecedented. A smaller reversal of the Fed's stimulus in the 1980s triggered the Latin American debt crisis and, in the 1990s, the Asian financial crisis. This time could be worse.

For a decade, India enjoyed the limelight in the BRIC club and received massive inflows of financial capital. The inflows went into its banking system and were lent out as consumer credit. India enjoyed a consumer-led economic boom. Despite much higher inflation than the global average, India's currency also stayed strong.

That, of course, was a typical emerging-market bubble during a global liquidity boom, a by-product of a Fed easing cycle. Even though the Fed is merely signalling the gradual unwinding of its quantitative easing programme and any rate hikes are still far away, India is already crashing. It shows how big the bubble is.

India is a poster child for an emerging-market bubble. It has run big fiscal and current-account deficits for years without being punished by the market. When the liquidity tide is rising, positive stories sell. After 2008, the hot story was the decoupling of emerging economies from the troubles in the West. It justified pouring trillions of dollars into them.

The hot money, as shown in India's case, pushed up growth but also created a bubble. India is just the first to be exposed. Many more will follow in the coming months.

Some economies haven't run big current-account or fiscal deficits and yet have experienced a credit bubble under the same forces. Hot money inflates credit growth. If that credit goes into activities that don't require too many imports, the bubble just distorts allocation of the expenditure. China, for example, has seen a massive increase in property investment, yet consumption has been depressed. Deflation would be required to shift the allocation back. That would leave behind many bad loans, proportional to the misallocations over the years.

The problems around the world could scare investors into running to the US … a sort of bubble yo-yo

Trouble spots may occur in unsuspecting places. East Asia, Hong Kong, South Korea and Malaysia have experienced unusually high rises in household debt levels. This has raised alarms. But, as the levels kept rising, the warnings lost credibility.

The Nordic countries have seen even higher household debt levels. They have bizarre mortgage products to rival the worst during the US bubble. Australia, a vast country with a small population, has crazy property prices. There have been many abnormalities around the world over the past six years. The odds are that they are bubbles and will burst on the Fed's reversal.

Devaluation or deflation: that is the choice for many economies. Devaluation seems preferable on the surface. It inflates away the excess credit creation. Hot money suffers because of exchange rate losses on the way out.

But, devaluation may cause widespread panic and turn into hyperinflation. Indonesia and Russia, for example, suffered this fate in 1998. A political crisis inevitably follows hyperinflation. Recovery could be a very long road after such events.

Deflation will probably cause a banking crisis. But, when the political situation is already fragile, it may be the only choice. A banking crisis could be handled through recapitalisation, funded with fiscal borrowing. As the economy recovers, the government could recoup all its money. An added benefit is that deflation bankrupts those who were most aggressive during the bubble. Such people are usually hell-bent on redistribution games, not value creation. Their demise would create space for new and value-adding businesses.

Devaluation would save these parasites who would continue to engage in redistribution. Deflation may be more painful now, but there would definitely be more gain later.

""The dollar is our currency, but your problem,"" former US Treasury secretary John Connally said four decades ago. The US economy was so dominant in the global economy that others couldn't influence US monetary policy. But the US is much smaller now. If a large number of economies go down because of the Fed's unwinding, the US may suffer so much that it could be forced to change its policy.

The future is more uncertain this time. There are two scenarios ahead. First, the problems around the world could scare investors into running to the US. Hence, despite a weakening global economy, the US would remain strong.

Of course, this would be a bubble; a sort of global bubble yo-yo - first, the hot money left the US and went into emerging economies in 2008. A few years down the road, the situation reverses.

Second, the US economy could dive due to the crises elsewhere. The Fed would",0.0,0.809261978073762,-1.0,0.0

Editors note: Anthony C. Quan, a.k.a. TEMPT, is a graffiti artist based in Los Angeles and the subject of the 2012 documentary Getting Up: The TEMPT ONE Story. He is currently in his eleventh year of living with ALS, which has rendered him almost completely paralyzed. In order to create his art, Quan uses the EyeWriter, an open-source device that allows the user to translate eye movements into pictures (he used a similar device to write this story for MUNCHIES). If you would like to see more of his art, visit his Facebook fan page or check out his blog.

I began painting graffiti art in inner-city Los Angeles in the early 1980s. I'm down with the K2S, STN, LOD, 213, WTM, and FB crews in LA, as well as WILDSTYLE and NCW in NYC. I've also been a drummer in various punk bands in East LA, curated graffiti shows, painted across the US, Mexico, and Canada. My work has been shown in galleries and museums around the world, and I've done work for clients such as Lollapalooza, Tribal Gear, B Boy Summit and the Black Eyed Peas, and published BIGTIME, an international publication on graffiti and street art. I've been lucky enough to be published in the seminal book about LA graffiti, called Graffiti LA. I even have a documentary film about my life.

This is why February 2003 particularly sucked. That month, I was diagnosed with ALS.

I was told that the cause is unknown and a cure is nonexistent, and that I had about a year to live. I was also told that what was left of my time on Earth would be spent completely conscious, but trapped inside a body that is 100-percent paralyzed. A body that wouldn't be able to move, communicate, take a piss on its own, be able to swallow or chew, or even breathe without a machine to do it for me.

The medical term for this is known as ""locked-in syndrome."" The street term for it is ""you're totally fucked, bro."" But I wasn't going down without a fight. If I was going to die, I was going to go down swinging, and veganism had my back.

Going back as far as I can remember, I've always been a fan of bean and cheese burritos. I don't mean the allergic-to-wheat, cooked-in-veggie-oil type of burritos synonymous with modern-day Los Angeles, either. To me, the definition of a good bean and cheese burrito was one that was cooked in tons of creamy lard and had so much yellow cheese that when you took a bite, all the oil from the cheese would ooze out to the opposite end and run down your arm like lava; anything less and I couldn't get my party on. I grew up on these torpedoes of molten joy.

I was your typical American boy in terms of my food choices and dietary habits, eating double chili cheeseburgers and huge orders of carne asada nachos, stuffing myself with fettuccine alfredo until I got dizzy trying to stand up, gorging on deep-fried chicken or fish, getting my money's worth at an all-you-can-eat buffet, or 3 AM runs to the best taco trucks in the 'hood. This is Southern California after al, the land – where fast food and drive-ins were invented and where the warm glow of Hollywood fantasies means you never had to think about tomorrow.

Suffice to say that, for three weeks, my entire world came crashing down in flames and ashes. But after those three weeks, I pulled myself back together and regained my composure. I was able to think and I began asking questions.

I had read somewhere that ALS was virtually nonexistent a hundred years ago. Why? Did people still die of ALS in proportionate numbers back then? Was it misdiagnosed or was there no understanding of ALS before the 20th century? And, if ALS didn't exist a hundred years ago, then what's happened in the last hundred years to bring it about? Common sense alone tells you that things don't ""just happen.""

I decided to get mad and apply everything that my punk rock upbringing taught me. I began researching everything on health and diet and the correlations with ALS. I knew that I had little productive time left, because every day my body was deteriorating and losing movement. So I spent countless hours at the library and stayed up all night on the internet, endlessly scrolling down pages. People in my immediate circle thought I was going crazy, and that I should conserve what little energy I had left. But conserve it for what?

256823,False,1024,"Late last week, the Human Rights Campaign announced a new project calling out the transphobic lies of infamous former Johns Hopkins professor Paul McHugh. McHugh has been a long-time opponent of the transgender community. His anti-transgender claims have been criticized for lack of veracity, but the religious right and their supporters still cite him.

According to HRC:

. . .the HRC Foundation launched McHugh Exposed, a website that pulls back the curtain on the anti-LGBTQ myths and junk science being peddled by Dr. Paul McHugh, the go-to 'expert' for anti-equality extremists. The resource includes a detailed timeline of how McHugh's hateful and damaging essays have been used to target and attack LGBTQ people and a new video featuring renowned LGBTQ health expert, Dr. Tonia Poteat. It can be found at www.McHughExposed.org. McHugh's false, non-scientific assertions have been used by anti-equality activists in state legislatures and courtrooms to defend discrimination against LGBTQ people. . . ""Paul McHugh's writings continue to dangerously undermine the safety, security and wellbeing of LGBTQ people, and particularly transgender youth, across the country,"" said Mary Beth Maxwell, HRC Vice President for Research, Training, and Programs. ""McHugh's junk science is still being referenced in legislative and legal battles despite the fact that Paul McHugh has no academic expertise in either gender or sexual orientation, and actively avoids publishing any of his anti-LGBTQ pieces in peer-reviewed journals. Policy makers, informed citizens and parents deserve to know that this is junk science and personal opinion - not at all in the mainstream of current medical and academic research and not endorsed by Johns Hopkins regardless of how McHugh uses his title to suggest credibility or expertise.""

HRC also launched a wonderful video which throws ""shade"" at religious right groups and their phony ""policy experts,"" i.e. the spokespeople they employ to go on news programs and in front of state and federal legislative bodies to spread their homophobic talking points.

This project by HRC is the latest endeavor of progressive and LGBTQ organizations to expose conservative and religious right groups who push lies and junk science against the LGBTQ community behind the facade of ""religious liberty.""

On April 13, the group Media Matters along with the National Center for Transgender Equality, The National LGBTQ Task Force, SoulForce, The Equality Federation, and The Matthew Shepard Foundation began the Eliminate Hate Campaign. According to its webpage

The Eliminate Hate Campaign is a broad-based nationwide coalition of organizations, faith leaders, and local community members who are united in our commitment to increase media accountability and public awareness of the growing influence and extremism of anti-LGBTQ hate groups; provide resources to empower grassroots actions to combat hate and extremism; and mitigating the harm caused by discrimination and bigotry. The Eliminate Hate Campaign was formed in response to Alliance Defending Freedom's designation as a hate group by Southern Poverty Law Center, where they join a long list of other anti-LGBTQ organizations.

The Eliminate Hate Campaign's webpage also includes resources and information which refute the anti-LGBTQ claims of the religious right, as well as the claim that these groups are motivated by personal religious beliefs.

And I personally think that it's about time. My blog, Holy Bullies and Headless Monsters, was created over 10 years ago for just that purpose - exposing religious right groups for their reliance of junk science, cherry-picked science, and out-and-out lies to denigrate the LGBTQ community while falsely claiming that their opposition is grounded in religious beliefs.

In truth, their opposition is grounded in the exploitation of religious beliefs and basic homophobia. I'm glad to see that there is more of an effort to call these folks out. Granted, they will probably distract and whine, falsely claiming that they are being ""silenced."" On the contrary, the effort undertaken by LGBTQ and progressive groups merely expands the conversation. It's high time that these so-called religious organizations defend the tactics they have used to denigrate us.

Those who have followed my blog over the years know that I've compiled a list of the times legitimate physicians, Ph.D.s, and researchers have called out religious right groups and personalities for distorting their work in order to denigrate the LGBTQ community.

257600,True,703,"Troll Hunter (2010), what you should watch instead of Jack the Giant Slayer

MY CALL: Good special effects, a dash of realistic biology and an interesting story make Trollhunter that which I always strive to find: something entertaining and unlike anything else I've seen. Clutch writing makes the characters as interesting as the monsters—a task which I feel is generally difficult. This film gets a solid, John-approved ""A"". IF YOU LIKE THIS, WATCH: Rare Exports: A Christmas Tale (2010) and Thale (2012). Both are also Scandinavian folklore-themed movies.

The movie opens with a mood-setting disclaimer that it was formed by chronologically assembling footage left behind by an anti-Mythbusters documentary film crew from the University of Volda. How very Norse-Blair Witch Project meets Cloverfield of them. The camerawork has all of the appeal of Cloverfield without the headache-inducing shakiness (except when briefly appropriate, for example, running from a troll!).

This film follows a group of student filmmakers as they follow Hans. Originally suspected of being a bear poacher, Hans is actually a somewhat bitter, poorly paid government employee charged with ""troll management"". This sounds slapstick-ridiculous, but I swear it is delivered very well with a straight face. Hans is charged with tracking and killing trolls that have wandered from their government-delineated territory—like a secret wildlife preserve. He hopes that filming these creatures and informing the public could improve future troll management strategies…that, and he's clearly sick of the secrecy and, perhaps, being under-appreciated.

Like a teenager on his first hunting trip with dad, they follow Hans' instructions and wash their armpits and crotch thoroughly before applying ""troll scent"" which, by their reactions, likely smells like a melted corpse. One last piece of advice: don't be a Christian. Evidently trolls hate Christians and all things Christian. Muslims, on the other hand, should be okay.

The depictions of the trolls stayed in the true spirit of classic folklore. But still there was a subtle attempt to explain a bit about troll biology. As a biologist, I found this charming. The extra heads (accessory organs, really) that some trolls develop throughout their life cycle assist them in peacocking to impress females and to intimidate other trolls. There are also two species (groups), each with various subspecies (types), of trolls. In as detailed a manner as one could expect from a movie like this, they even explain why trolls turn to stone when exposed to ultraviolet light (and why some explode instead). Troll detection, tracking, various baiting techniques, gestation periods, intelligence, and the simple fact that they are mammals are all addressed, even if only briefly. It's all very cool, understated, and strangely realistic–despite the trolls.

The behavior and variety of the trolls they encounter make this film feel like Where the Wild Things Are for fanboys. There are several different troll scenes and the types of trolls differ as much as the circumstances of their encounter. While the effects are not amazing, they are every bit as good as they need to be to maintain the credibility of a world in which trolls exist and, more importantly, to keep us entertained. I never felt that the effects ""could have been better"".

256352,False,1024,"How far can you go in a small plane for your money?
The $100 hamburger is a cliche of hobby aviation.  The idea being that you fly somewhere for a meal, and when including the cost of the flight the meal costs $100.  Well that trope is pretty old and flying costs have escalated. I've often had people ask me how much it costs to fly someplace.  There isn't a standard answer and it's hard to calculate because of various factors described, as I will now summarize.
My Piper Warrior Background: I fly a Piper PA28-161 Warrior.  This plane type is available for rent at the Wings of Carolina Flying Club , based at the Raleigh Executive Jetport north of Sanford, NC.  The rental rate is wet, meaning everything including fuel is included, so the plane rental is the all-in cost of the flight.  The price of the rental fluctuates with fuel costs but as of this writing it is just under $105 per hour. For your $105 per hour you get a four-seat airplane that cruises at 110 knots, or 127 miles per hour.  This is airspeed, your ground speed is affected by the winds.  For example, if you are flying against a 10 mph headwind, your speed over the ground will be 117 miles per hour.  You'll also fly slower while climbing to your cruising altitude. Coming up with a cost by computing raw distance vs speed vs rental rate isn't sufficient because rental rates are from engine start to engine stop so you also have to account for preflight, taxiing, maneuvering in the local terminal area, etc.  Your rental time is read off a Hobbs meter  that starts and stops with engine start and stop, so is usually called ""Hobbs Time"" I've tried playing around with flight planning tools to make an approximation but the results don't account for all these factors so the numbers are off.  The only way to know is actual experience. So I did some historical research in my logbook, and combined it with current airplane costs to come up for some costs for various destinations I've been to.  Hopefully this will help answer two questions, one being ""how much does it cost to fly to x?"" and  the other being ""where can you fly for $y?"" The results are in the following table, sorted by ascending distance:

Oshkosh, WI 16 $1,680.00 Includes fuel stops and spectacular flight up the Chicago lakeshore . Famous annual air show held here You may think that some of these costs are high, and they can get high as flying is not a cheap hobby. But many if not most of these flights, especially to dinner destinations, are made with another pilot sharing the flying time and the expenses, so one person's cost for the flights is half the amount shown.  On trips to Oshkosh, sometimes three pilots go and share flying and expenses. Another note is the big jump in time and therefore cost between Cincy and farther destinations, even though the distance is not necessarily proportionally more.  This is because once",0.0,0.6901848419190891,-1.0,0.0

import javax.inject.Inject import scala.concurrent.Future import scala.concurrent.duration._ import play.api.mvc._ import play.api.libs.ws._ import play.api.http.HttpEntity import akka.actor.ActorSystem import akka.stream.ActorMaterializer import akka.stream.scaladsl._ import akka.util.ByteString import scala.concurrent.ExecutionContext class Application @Inject() (ws: WSClient) extends Controller { }

We've called the WSClient instance ws , all the following examples will assume this name.

To build an HTTP request, you start with ws.url() to specify the URL.

val request: WSRequest = ws.url(url)

This returns a WSRequest that you can use to specify various HTTP options, such as setting headers. You can chain calls together to construct complex requests.

val complexRequest: WSRequest = request.withHeaders(""Accept"" -> ""application/json"") .withRequestTimeout(10000.millis) .withQueryString(""search"" -> ""play"")

You end by calling a method corresponding to the HTTP method you want to use. This ends the chain, and uses all the options defined on the built request in the WSRequest .

val futureResponse: Future[WSResponse] = complexRequest.get()

This returns a Future[WSResponse] where the Response contains the data returned from the server.

If you need to use HTTP authentication, you can specify it in the builder, using a username, password, and an AuthScheme. Valid case objects for the AuthScheme are BASIC , DIGEST , KERBEROS , NTLM , and SPNEGO .

ws.url(url).withAuth(user, password, WSAuthScheme.BASIC).get()

If an HTTP call results in a 302 or a 301 redirect, you can automatically follow the redirect without having to make another call.

ws.url(url).withFollowRedirects(true).get()

Parameters can be specified as a series of key/value tuples.

ws.url(url).withQueryString(""paramKey"" -> ""paramValue"").get()

Headers can be specified as a series of key/value tuples.

ws.url(url).withHeaders(""headerKey"" -> ""headerValue"").get()

If you are sending plain text in a particular format, you may want to define the content type explicitly.

ws.url(url).withHeaders(""Content-Type"" -> ""application/xml"").post(xmlString)

A virtual host can be specified as a string.

ws.url(url).withVirtualHost(""192.168.1.1"").get()

If you wish to specify a request timeout, you can use withRequestTimeout to set a value. An infinite timeout can be set by passing Duration.Inf .

ws.url(url).withRequestTimeout(5000.millis).get()

To post url-form-encoded data a Map[String, Seq[String]] needs to be passed into post .

ws.url(url).post(Map(""key"" -> Seq(""value"")))

To post multipart-form-encoded data a Source[play.api.mvc.MultipartFormData.Part[Source[ByteString, Any]], Any] needs to be passed into post .

ws.url(url).post(Source.single(DataPart(""key"", ""value"")))

To upload a file you need to pass a play.api.mvc.MultipartFormData.FilePart[Source[ByteString, Any]] to the Source :

258573,False,1024,"We've updated our data for SEO jobs and salaries in 2018. See the 2018 Inbound Marketing Jobs Salary Guide

The 2016 Inbound Marketing Jobs Salary Guide is here! In this post, we're focusing on a single significant finding: SEO jobs and salaries have declined this year in the US. But don't forget to download the full infographic for the breakdown of inbound marketing salaries by job title and cities in the United States, Australia, Canada, and the UK.

DOWNLOAD NOW

Back to today's headline: should the decline of SEO salaries worry inbound marketers? Does it confirm the dreaded ""death of SEO""?

The opposite is true: the decline in inbound marketing jobs and salaries actually means that SEO is on the rise. Instead of existing as a siloed function, SEO is expanding into a common skill universally featured among different roles.

But first, the data:


7% Decline in Number of SEO Jobs in the Top 20 Cities

The overall number of SEO-related jobs has declined by 7% in the top cities in the United States.

From our data in 2015, 70% of the 20 cities we looked at saw their SEO-related job listings go down. The larger cities saw a modest increase in number of jobs or remained flat.


6% Average Salary Decline in SEO Job Titles Evaluated

The average salary decline was 6%, with SEO Coordinator seeing the highest decline at 19%. All job roles saw a salary decline except the Account Manager role, which saw a slight salary increase of 1%.


SEO Becomes a Universal Skill — Why Job Decline Is Good for SEO

A 7% decline in jobs and a 6% decline in average salaries might sound scary for those in the SEO industry, but it actually points to a maturity, not a deterioration, of the SEO industry.

Instead of SEO as a job skill held by a single marketer on a team, SEO is becoming a needed skill for a diverse set of professionals across the organization.

SEO is leveraged by executives to understand drops and gains in revenue, by content marketers to make sure what they create is found by a larger audience, and by product managers to ensure they're creating and naming products to align to their customers needs. The list goes on; SEO now touches many more roles as a foundational part of how companies function and grow.

Here are some thoughts from industry leaders on how the decline in SEO jobs is in fact good news for the industry.

1. Rand Fishkin (Moz): SEO Continues to Grow in Importance

""I strongly suspect this is indeed because SEO is becoming less a job title and more a job requirement/skill. We saw that trend beginning a couple years back, and I think it's getting stronger and stronger.

As a skill, SEO continues to grow in importance. We saw it move up on LinkedIn's list of skills that get people hired all the way to #4 – the highest it's ever been.

The growth in the number of jobs that require SEO as a skill would, naturally, lead to the average salary going down as more entry-level and less-experienced folks enter the profession. In our survey data, we see that years of experience strongly correspond to salary increases, as do more expensive geographies (and the broadening of SEO to less expensive job markets would also be a downward driver of average salary).

None of this is to say that folks in the industry should ignore the numbers here – just that we should balance them against a full picture of the field's trends.""

""I strongly suspect this is indeed because SEO is becoming less a job title and more a job requirement/skill… The growth in the number of jobs that require SEO as a skill would, naturally, lead to the average salary going down as more entry-level and less-experienced folks enter the profession.""

-Rand Fishkin, Moz

2. Brian Dean (Backlinko): The Changing of the SEO Role

""It looks like the idea of an ""SEO"" is changing fast. More and more executives realize that some of the best people out there to boost search engine rankings DON'T identify themselves as ""SEO professionals.""Instead, they call themselves ""inbound marketers"" or ""content marketers"".

I also imagine, instead of hiring 10 SEO people, companies are hiring 5 SEOs and a mishmash of UX pros, content marketers, designers and copywriters. In other words, the marketing team of the future.

That being said, there will always be a role for a true SEO within a marketing team. So I expect this trend to stabilize soon.""

258642,False,1024,"Nothing is worse than waiting for a game that is nowhere near close to being ready. It is a nightmare of cruel proportions. Yet, here we are, existing at a time when the genre of MMORPGs seems heavily weighted to what is on the horizon than what we have available to play right now. Sure, WildStar just went free to play and next month will see the release of an anticipated expansion pack or two, but by and large the things we're really itching to see won't be available until next year, after the winter. Now is the winter of our discontent. So, because I like putting salt on the wound, I've gone and rounded up some of the most exciting upcoming MMORPGs so that we can all gather and whine together. Some of these might not be your cup of tea, and I'm sure I've left out one or two that you're excited for, which means you'll just have to whine louder than the rest of us! But here they are, in no particular order, some of our most anticipated releases.

Guild Wars 2: Heart of Thorns

Guild Wars 2 is finally getting an expansion pack, one that really looks like it might totally redefine the whole Guild Wars experience. After all, ArenaNet is so confident that this new expansion will only grow the game that they've decided to give away Guild Wars 2 for free. That's a bold move, we'll have to see how it pans out.

Heart of Thorns is arriving very soon with a pretty heft feature list. Along with a new region of the world, known as the Heart of Maguuma (which is really separate zones in the same area) there is also a whole host of new things to look forward to. Chiefly among them is the new profession, the Revenant, which has been tearing up the latest trailers while tempting World of Warcraft fans into abandoning their attempts to wait until the new Warcraft expansion introduces Demon Hunters. Revenants look awesome. Beyond that, one can expect each and every profession to unlock a new Mastery which will provide even more options for building your character.

Oh yeah, and how could we forget about Guild Halls? They combine everything Guild Wars 2 does well, like PVP, while finally giving the game a chance to actually live up to its namesake. I mean, name aside, guilds weren't all that important to Guild Wars 2 until now.

With Heart of Thorns so close to launching that we can already smell the cut grass, this one is definitely riding high on our list of upcoming MMORPGs.

Albion Online

You know what I can never get enough of? Sandbox MMORPGs. They are the best, and the world deserves more of them. Which is why I'm really excited for Albion Online to hopefully make its way to us at some point next year. There is a closed beta scheduled for November that you can buy into if you just can't wait—which might very well be the case.

Albion Online sports a shiny player driven economy and an online experience that tosses out rigid class structures to focus more on adapting to how you want to play. In Albion Online, you're only as good as the armor you wear. There's also a huge progression tree to work through that helps steer your time in the game that will give completionists nightmares.

Developed in Unity, the free-to-play Albion certainly looks like it draws inspiration from Runescape, but I find the visuals incredibly charming and inviting. Oh, and the fact that when you die in certain zones you drop everything really adds to that charm. Seriously. I'm excited for that.

But what really has my interest piqued regarding Albion Online is how the game intends to release for mobile platforms. Not too many MMORPGs can be played from the iPad, and the ones that can are often better not spoken of. Having Albion Online, a presumably cool experience, could be a real big game changer. Also I'm lazy and playing an MMORPG from bed sounds like heaven.

Tom Clancy's The Division

Ah, The Division, the one game on this list that I have to wonder if it's going to completely squander all of its potential. I actually got a chance to go hands on with The Division at this year's PAX Prime, and while I didn't have to scoop my jaw off the floor, the game did handle well. That said, I also didn't do or see anything that I haven't seen a million times before, but the blame is more on the nature of the demo itself.

That said, The Division remains so high up on our list because of its compelling premise. Destiny certainly dropped the ball with merging shooting and emergent online gameplay, and there is definitely room for The Division to swoop in and save the day. Or it could fall flat on its face. The jury is still out.

258023,False,1024,"As a colorful circus of tents pops up at Everest Base Camp this spring, a pair of Ph.D. students will set up camp 1,000 feet downvalley, on the Khumbu Glacier, resuming a research project they started last year. Their goal: to determine just how quickly the world's highest glacier is melting.

From the Alps to the Andes, ice at high elevations is disappearing rapidly. On Everest, the effects of a warming planet are likely to manifest in two ways that affect climbers. First, the Khumbu Glacier will shrink, and parts of it could possibly become impassable for climbers. Someday, even Base Camp may have to be moved from its current location on the glacier to another spot nearby.

Second, the Khumbu Icefall between Base Camp and Camp I may see a higher frequency of rock and ice avalanches—like the one that killed 16 Sherpas in 2014. The Icefall naturally migrates downhill between three and four feet per day, but that could accelerate as temperatures rise. Earth's average surface temperature has gone up by more than 1.5 degrees since the late 1800s, and two-thirds of that warming has taken place since 1975.

""It doesn't take a rocket scientist to work out that if you increase the temperature where ice is normally frozen to the bedrock, the hold is going to be weakened and become increasingly unstable and the ice is more likely to detach from the bedrock,"" says Duncan Quincey, professor of geomorphology at the University of Leeds, in the UK. He is supervising the research of Owen King and Scott Watson, the Ph.D. students who will spend a few weeks on the glacier this spring. ""In places like the Icefall we've seen these tragic accidents, and I think it's fair to say it's symptomatic of high-elevation warming.""

It's not just unstable ice that poses a risk—the meltwater is concerning, too. Meltwater naturally pools on the surface of both the Khumbu Glacier, on Everest's south side, and the Rongbuk Glacier on the north side during the warmer months, then drains and reforms as the seasons change. The issue now is that the ponds don't disappear, but instead coalesce into small lakes. An upcoming paper co-authored by Watson, Quincey, and two other supervisors shows that the ponds on the lower part of the Khumbu Glacier increased in size by 84 percent from 2009 to 2015.

The size and depth of the lakes on the Khumbu Glacier vary. Some are several hundred feet long and others are deep and wide enough to merit the use of boats. King and Watson will use an inflatable kayak to deploy temperature sensors into the ponds. (In fact, they will set the record for highest altitude kayaking. They've already been in touch with Guinness World Records.)

""Across the Eastern area of the Himalaya there are more and more [lakes] developing,"" says Quincey. ""It's a positive feedback cycle: a small pond absorbs more radiation than it would if it was rock, and that heats the water, which melts more ice, and the pond gets bigger.""

At some point, the side of one of the lakes on the Khumbu Glacier may give way, sending water and debris cascading down into villages in the Khumbu Valley below. The researchers aren't predicting such an outburst any time soon, but it's still a concern, Quincey says. ""While the last thing I want to do is start saying there's imminent disaster, you really don't want a big lake there at the head of that valley.""

Such a burst has happened before. In 1985, Dig Tsho, a glacial lake in Sagarmatha National Park burst through the moraine dam holding it back, destroying a new hydropower station, 30 houses, and 14 bridges in the Khumbu Valley. Imja Tsho, a large glacial lake in the Everest region, is located just above the Chukhung Valley, which has a number of villages that cater to trekkers, like Dingboche, and has been widely recognized for its potential to flood the valley below, the researchers say.

King and Watson spent six weeks on the Khumbu Glacier last fall, and when they return in May they'll again deploy their temperature sensors and take photos to inform their 3D elevation model of ice cliffs around the glacier. They're also using satellite imagery to measure the size of the ponds and building a robot to measure volume. Their results will help shed light on how all debris-covered glaciers in the central Himalaya responding to the temperature change in a similar way.

""I walked every piece of that valley last fall, which took the better part of a month,"" King says. ""In May, we'll resurvey the same area, which will show us what's been going on with the surface. It",0.18151403477176276,0.7815140347717628,-0.6000000000000001,0.0

259780,True,701,"Microsoft is not a company renowned for changing its mind on things, but that's exactly what the company did today with its Xbox One console.

After a month of criticisms of its always-on DRM systems for game trade-ins and the online requirement, the Xbox team did something virtually unheard of in the video game industry - it changed its tune.

Gone are the requirements of the Xbox One checking in to Xbox servers every 24 hours. Gone are the restrictions on traded-in games.

And perhaps best of all for Australian gamers, gone are the arbitrary restrictions of region coding.

Since the dawn of the original Xbox, Microsoft has restricted the games that the console can play depending on where you live.

But as part of Don Mattrick's Xbox One 80 announcement came confirmation that regional restrictions have gone the way of… Well, the way of the Xbox One's daily Internet check-in.

While Australia has managed to get away with playing games from the UK thanks to shared region coding, the Xbox One will be the first Microsoft console to let Australian gamers buy games online from places like America and Japan.

Save a buck, save the world

This is a big deal. Despite Microsoft confirming that One games will cost the same as their 360 counterparts, the fact remains that the price of games varies greatly around the world.

For Australians, who regularly face recommended retail prices of $120 a game (compared to $US70) in America), this is a very convenient way of saving some money on a games library.

Even with shipping, in many cases it's cheaper to buy a game from the US than it is to pick it up from the local EB Games store.

And while many pundits are now lamenting the lost possibility of Steam-like savings that Microsoft could have offered with its original, DRM-laden Xbox One, the fact remains that region free gaming is a proven way to save money on games.

But even more importantly than cost, having a region free console allows gamers to experience games that might not get an Australian release. Fans of JRPGs, for example, will be able to import games without needing a foreign console.

And who can forget the frustrations of Rock Band lovers in the current generation who couldn't purchase the game's sequel in Australia without importing?

The good news also translates for non-Australians: this will also have the benefit of killing off the rumour that the Xbox One would only work in 21 countries around the world.

It's only a game

It's not all fireworks and champagne for international bargain hunters though. While Mattrick made it abundantly clear that Xbox One games will not have region locking, there has been no indication that the same rule will apply to Blu-ray discs or content available through the Xbox Live Marketplace.

In fact, given the similarities between the new terms and the Xbox 360's offering, it's unlikely the console will be completely region free.

To be fair, it's unlikely that Sony is looking at unlocking movie and PSN content across regions. But regardless of console manufacturer, it's still an arbitrary restriction for international gamers.

But perhaps we protest too much. The fact that the Xbox One and the PS4 are both games consoles, having region-free games is still a step in the right direction for Microsoft, and a much more palatable solution for gamers.",0.7604323573100655,0.7604323573100655,0.0,0.0
257016,False,1024,"Brooke Covington, a member of the Word of Faith Fellowship, leaves a hearing in Rutherfordton, N.C. on May 19. (Kathy Kmonicek/AP)

Matthew Fenner was leaving a Sunday prayer service in January 2013 when a group of church members surrounded him.

As he told police, a church leader and more than 20 other members of the Word of Faith Fellowship — based in the foothills of the Blue Ridge Mountains in Spindale, N.C. — repeatedly punched, beat and knocked him down for about two hours. At one point, someone grabbed him by the throat and shook him, he said.

That attacks took place ""to break me free of the homosexual demons they so viciously despise,"" Fenner, who identifies as gay, told television station WSPA a year later. After the episode, he left the fellowship.

In December 2014, a minister and four members of the Rutherford County church were indicted on charges that they kidnapped, beat and strangled Fenner, then 21. They pleaded not guilty.

And on Thursday, Fenner was the first person to testify in the trial of Brooke Covington, 58, the church minister accused of leading the alleged kidnapping and assault of Fenner on that day, more than four years ago. She is the first of five church members to face trial in the case, the Associated Press reported. If convicted, she faces up to two years in prison.

Fenner said he thought he was ""going to die"" while the church members beat and choked him. He accused Covington of telling him, ""God said there is something wrong in your life.""

""I'm frail and in my mind, I'm thinking, 'Is my neck going to break, am I going to die?'"" Fenner said, adding he had cancer as a child and underwent a biopsy a week before the attack took place, the Associated Press reported.

When Fenner brought the allegations three years ago, it was not the first time the church had been accused of beating members over their sexual orientation. Two years earlier, former church member Michael Lowry said he was beaten and held against his will at the church as an effort to eliminate his gay demons.

Lowry testified before a grand jury, but about a year later, the same month Fenner says he was beaten and strangled, Lowry rejoined Word of Faith and took back his allegations. He has since left the church, and later said in a statement that his original claims are true.

The Word of Faith, opened by Jane and Sam Whaley in 1979 in a former steakhouse, began with a handful of followers and grew to a 750-member congregation in North Carolina. Eventually another 2,000 members would join affiliated churches in Brazil, Ghana and other countries.

The church was described in a 2012 profile in the Charlotte Observer as a diverse and close-knit congregation with an ecstatic style of worship. Sometimes members would hop, sway, shout prayer songs and speak in tongues. ""God has freed us"" to be loud, Whaley would say.

In the four decades since the Word of Faith was founded, it has been entangled in a series of lawsuits, criminal charges and custody fights surrounding its treatment of children. More than 15 years ago, the state and Rutherford County Department of Social Services launched a series of investigations into allegations the church abused children, the Charlotte Observer reported. Jane Whaley was charged with assaulting one of her followers, but the charges were later dismissed.

Brooke Covington, the minister accused in the assault of Fenner, is the daughter of Jane and Sam Whaley, according to the Charlotte Observer.

In an Associated Press investigation in February, which relied on interviews with dozens of members, documents and secret recordings, the agency reported that Word of Faith congregants were routinely punched, smacked, choked, slammed to the floor or thrown through walls ""in a violent form of deliverance meant to 'purify' sinners by beating out devils.""

The church's strict set of rules mandate whether its congregants can marry or have children. Members can't watch television, go to the movies, read newspapers or eat in restaurants that play music or serve alcohol, the Associated Press reported.

Covington's lawyer, David Teddy, argued that Fenner once publicly commended the church for releasing him from a life ""filled with sin"" and praised it in his high school graduation speech. Teddy also said Fenner never told anyone to stop hitting him, to which Fenner responded by saying that complaining would have made the physical abuse worse.

""We are adamant that no one ever physically harmed Mr. Fenner,"" attorney Josh Farmer wrote to WSPA in 2014. ""The church does NOT target members who are gay.""

At a grand jury hearing in 2014, Fenner's mother and brother, who were then still members of the church, were among the witnesses who",0.6256036386221364,0.8256036386221364,-0.2,0.0

Founded in 1913, the club still pursues a strict dress code, incomprehensible to most outsiders, as a Buddhist monk would find out last year.


As it happened, Bhutan's second-highest ranking monk was barred from dining at the club, just because he was wearing sandals and the traditional lama attire.


Also, as a reminder to the old, feudal order, a notice at the entrance of the club prohibits ""servants and drivers"" from having food inside the premises -– just like it had barred the entry of ""Indians and dogs"" during the Raj.


In 2011, Bangalore Club barred the entry of members with any kind of facial veil

Old guards

Col. O.P. Malhotra (retd), Secretary of Delhi Gymkhana, however, insists that changes to the club's rules and regulations are made from time to time.


""Every room at the club has a different dress code,"" says he, recounting how one can now enter Dining Room in dhoti-kurta, salwar-kameez and pyjama-kurta preferably with Nehru jacket, among others.


But the more they change, the more they remain the same, thanks to the rigorous selection process.


""It is an arduous process,"" says a member of the club willing to be anonymous.


""You apply now, and you may be called in for an interview 20 years later,"" tells he, emphasising on the word may be.


As if to defend the long waiting period, he adds: ""Gymkhana will take even more. Last heard, an applicant is unlikely to get a call before 30 years, provided he is wellconnected politically or has a family member in the club.""

If you want to join these clubs, get in a queue, because it's a long one. And, don't forget to straighten your tie and press your suit. Pictured is Bombay Gymkhana, an elite club in Mumbai

Private bodies

Purrshottam Bhaggeria, author of Elite Clubs of India, however, supports the selection process.


""If anyone could enter the premises, then it would turn into a hotel.""


What he questions is the dress code.


""They were made during the British era, by men who used to wear suit and tie.But now, if anyone wishes to enter the club wearing the national dress, what is the problem with that? Be it a dhoti in Tamil Nadu or a kurta-pajama in north India, how can anyone stop you from wearing the national dress?""


Social scientist Shiv Visvanathan, who though wants 'Anglophilic clubs' to change their rules, upholds the right of these private institutions to allow whosoever they want to enter the premises.


""A dress code does not violate the Constitution, rather they are to do with a club's code of conduct. If someone were to start a 'pink club' where everyone would have to wear pink, it wouldn't be considered unconstitutional,"" says he.

To this, a member of Delhi Gymkhana adds: ""We don't invite people. If they have problem with our ways of functioning, they shouldn't join us. Most people want to join us to upgrade themselves socially, and yet they lecture us on the issue of equality.""

255906,False,1024,"Clinton Foundation officials have ignored virtually all of the ""best practices"" urged by good governance organizations for public charities, according to an investigation by The Daily Caller News Foundation.

Most glaringly, for example, the foundation's insular board of directors is unusually small, ranging from only two to no more than five members, all of whom are among President Bill and Hillary Clinton's closest and richest friends.

The ""good governance"" movement in the nonprofit field has been gathering strength for two decades, but it clearly has yet to reach the Clinton Foundation. Most foundation boards have on average 15 members, according to a 2015 survey by Boardsource, a national organization working to strengthen nonprofit board leadership.

Good governance groups also encourage well-managed non-profits to create dedicated oversight committees for audits, donations, governance, executive compensation and whistle-blower policy. The Clinton Foundation has none of those committees, according to its Internal Revenue Service 990 tax filings.

Term-limits are also recommended for board members to encourage fresh thinking in non-profit management. Seventy-one percent of all public foundations today have term limits, according to Boardsource.

Most of the Clinton Foundation's board members have occupied the same board seats for most of the controversial non-profit's life.

Arms-length, independent boards also are considered the essential first step in good governance.

The Independent Sector, a non-partisan good governance organization for nonprofits and foundations urge the creation of independent boards and said they should be in the majority. ""A substantial majority of the board of a public charity, usually meaning at least two-thirds of its members, should be independent,"" the group recommended.

That is not the case with the Clinton Foundation. The board consists of Bill Clinton's tightest inner circle, including Democratic mega-fundraiser and now Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe, former Arkansas Democratic Sen. David Pryor and the senator's former aide, J.L. ""Skip Rutherford.

McAuliffe was the top fundraiser for Bill and Hillary's Clinton's presidential campaigns. He also put up $1.35 million of his own cash to pay for the Clinton's first 11-room mansion in Chappaqua, New York.

The gift infuriated liberal activist Fred Wertheimer who at the time said, ""It's just plain wrong. It's dangerous. It's inappropriate,"" adding, ""This is a financial favor worth over a million dollars to the president.""

Charles Ortel, a Wall Street analyst and twice a trustee of public foundations, argued the gift should have been disclosed in the foundation's tax returns.

""Terry McAuliffe made it possible for the Clinton's to buy their house in Chappaqua. That's a significant financial relationship that should have been disclosed in the 990's (tax return) and was not. And has never been corrected,"" he said in an interview.

TheDCNF asked Gov. McAuliffe's office to provide details of the terms of the cash payment and if the Clinton's had paid it back. The governor's office did not reply.

Sen. Pryor established a second legal defense fund for Bill Clinton after it was discovered that the first defense committee accepted $600,000 in illegal contributions raised by his longtime friend Charlie Trie. Reportedly, Trie delivered the money in two thick envelopes. He was convicted of election law violations.

Both defense funds were trying to raise money for Clinton's legal fees generated by the Whitewater scandal and the President's reported affairs with Monica Lewinsky and Paula Jones.

Rotating on and off the board were other two women. One is Cheryl Mills who served as White House counsel to Bill Clinton and chief of staff for Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. Mills got into trouble when it was revealed she was double dipping and taking a salary from both the foundation and the State Department.

The other long-time board member was Ann Jordan, wife of one of Bill's closest advisors, Vernon Jordan.

""When there too many insiders, it certainly does raise red flags,"" said Vernetta Walker, the vice president and chief governance officer at Boardsource in an interview with TheDCNF.

You want a board that can say 'no,' adds Leslie Lenkowsky, a founding member of Bill Clinton's Corporation for National and Community Service and an expert on philanthropy.

""It's kind of hard to imagine those people will say no very easily to something the Clinton's want to do,"" he told TheDCNF. Lenkowsky later directed the Corporation under President George W. Bush.

McAuliffe, Pryor, Mills and Jordan serve as board members from 2000 to 2005. Pryor jumped off to become the Dean of the Clinton School of Public Service at the University of Arkansas. Rutherford would join the school after his stint at the foundation.

In 2006 McAuliffe and Mills were the only ones on the board. That year its net assets spiked from $80 million two years earlier to more",0.5416206305165974,0.7416206305165973,-0.2,0.0

258165,True,465,"Police in Florida say a 19-year-old Tampa man has turned an innocent stuffed horse into his personal sex toy while shopping at Walmart.

Sean Johnson was arrested Tuesday at the big-box store located in Brooksville and charged with indecent exposure and criminal mischief after Walmart employees told police that the 19-year-old had been spotted pleasuring himself with the help of a stuffed animal.

Johnson was taken to the Hernando County Jail but was later released after posting $1,500 bail.

Horse whisperer: Sean Johnson, 19, was charged with indecent exposure and criminal mischief after Walmart store cameras caught him defiling a stuffed horse toy

Not your average toy: Police say Johnson picked out a horse toy (similar to the one pictured) from the clearance section, took it to the bedding department and used it to pleasure himself

According to Johnson's arrest report, the suspect was caught on surveillance cameras just before 3pm Tuesday acting suspiciously.

The teenager reportedly removed a brown, black and red stuffed horse from a clearance shelf and walked over to the bedding department, where police say he proceeded to pleasure himself using the toy, TBO.com reported.

The arrest report cited by The Smoking Gun described in graphic detail how the 19-year-old man allegedly pulled out his genitals so he could 'hump the stuffed horse utilizing short fast movements' until he achieved satisfaction.

Store cameras then captured Johnson placing the defiled horsey smeared with bodily fluids on top of a packaged comforter set.

The 19-year-old then took off running but was apprehended a short time later.

When questioned by police, Johnson reportedly came clean about his bizarre amorous encounter with an inanimate plaything.

Disgusting: Johnson later replaced the defiled stuffed animal covered in bodily fluids on a shelf at the Brooksville Walmart and ran off, but was quickly caught

'I did unmentionables to a stuffed animal,' Johnson said in a written statement. 'The officer put it into perspective of what would happen if somebody would pick it up and use it.

'I did not think of it the way he put it and I so feel like I did a horrible act.'",0.6882665768265724,0.7882665768265724,-0.1,0.0

RICHMOND, Va. -- A 20-year-old Virginia Commonwealth University student was killed overnight in the Carver neighborhood, adjacent to the university.

Samuel Kwarteng, from Alexandria, Va., was shot and killed during an altercation off campus in the 1200 block of W. Moore Street, VCU President Michael Rao announced. Kwarteng resided in the 1700 block of Jacqulin Street, according to police, and the suspect charged with involuntary manslaughter resided at the Moore St. home.

""It is with great sadness that I inform the university community of the tragic death this morning of a VCU student,"" Rao said.

""I am sure you join me in sending our thoughts and prayers to Samuel's family and friends in this time of great loss,"" Rao continued. ""The VCU Counseling Center has been alerted and its services are available to anyone who needs assistance in dealing with this tragic event.""

Kwarteng died on the front porch of the home.

The suspect, Emmanuel E. Jordan, 20, of the 1200 block of West Moore Street, was arrested shortly afterward, Richmond Police said. He was charged with involuntary manslaughter.

A neighbor said that the home is occupied by about eight young people and there is always a lot of activity in the home.

Witnesses said they heard people screaming and arguing and then they heard gunfire. A neighbor with three children said they were hiding in fear.

Rao said the incident was isolated.

Family members told CBS 6 reporter Claudia Rupcich that Kwarteng was ""was a very committed, loving, and happy person,"" and that he ""always wanted his loved ones to be happy."" A cousin of the victim said that Kwarteng was a senior, studying electrical engineering.

Casey Bannon grew up with Kwarteng inNorthernVirginia and the two attended Mount Vernon High School.

""He treated me like a brother,"" Bannon said. ""We didn't look alike, but he always treated me like we did.""

Friends took to social media with messages of shock and sadness.

To the academic and social justice organizing communities which I have been part of for many years, and to whom I am indebted:

I have always been, and will always be Cherokee. I have consistently identified myself based on what I knew to be true. My enrollment status does not impact my Cherokee identity or my continued commitment to organizing for justice for Native communities.

There have been innumerable false statements made about me in the media. But ultimately what is most concerning is that these social media attacks send a chilling message to all Native peoples who are not enrolled, or who are otherwise marginalized, that they should not publicly work for justice for Native peoples out of fear that they too may one day be attacked. It is my hope that more Indigenous peoples will answer the call to work for social justice without fear of being subjected to violent identity-policing. I also hope the field of Native studies might attend to disagreement and difference in a manner that respects the dignity of all persons rather than through abusive social media campaigns.

258043,False,1024,"The other day I found myself looking through the plant patents held by the Zaiger's Genetics team. The Zaigers, a family of plant breeders led by a UC Davis Plant Pathology graduate, have developed some very cool fruits. You may know of the pluot, and apparently they have a peach with low acid that has taken the world by storm. They have developed many plants with important and beneficial characteristics besides taste – but they taste great too.

I know some people dislike patents, but I have no objection to people who have developed these novel plants having patents on them. But considering what it takes to breed wonderful fruit tree varieties like these, you can understand why these patents exist.

Zaiger's Genetics has been breeding fruit trees for decades, with many interesting successes. For some background on Floyd Zaiger a fruit innovator to the world and his family that continues this work, there was a great article in SFGate last year. One fruit they describe in that article is a hybridized nectarine popular in Spain:

One of Zaiger's hybridized nectarines grown in Spain can mature 10 days ahead of anything else in Europe – ""so they have a market almost all to themselves,"" he says. That 10-day difference can make or break a country's fruit industry.

Lately, some people have been objecting to the use of hybrid crops, but I don't have a problem with it. Early maturing fruit can have financial benefits as we see here – but in a time of climate change, shifting the maturity rates could be a really important strategy.

The Zaiger Genetics team has developed a huge number of useful fruits. One article some years back on Designer Fruit described some others:

Among his achievements, Zaiger, 78, has found a way to reduce the acid level in peaches, give unripe apricots an appealing red blush, and make white nectarines—previously a mushy mess—firm enough to be shipped around the world.

Firmness for shipping may not be your favorite characteristic, but if farmers can't get fruits to customers that is a problem. And the fewer fruits lost in transit, the better. Reducing food waste is something worthwhile.

So shifting maturation – to either earlier or later, as the Zaigers have accomplished – is valuable. Texture and shipping characteristics also benefit farmers and consumers. There's a list of other types of features on the Dave Wilson Nursery (the Zaiger's distributor) that are under investigation. Cool stuff.

But the particular piece that struck me last week was one specifically about one of the recent patents that was issued. It's on a cherry called Royal Tioga, selected for fruit that ripens early and is large. It seems to me this could be a great idea not only to extend the range of this tree – but considering these times of climate change it might be beneficial to bloom and fruit earlier to potentially avoid temperatures that are too high or conditions that are too dry. There may be other plants that could require other shifts for other locations, or maybe survive wetter situations.

In a post at Txchnologist, Michael Keller reported on this new patent, and talked to the Zaiger team. Txchnical Improvements: Onward, Cherry Development! The work that went into this was described by Floyd's daughter Leith:

""It took 45 years of sorting through the junk offspring to find the seedlings that took us where we wanted to go,"" says Gardner. ""Ninety-nine percent of them didn't have the qualities we were looking for.""

The Zaiger team uses only conventional breeding strategies. That's completely fine – I would never withhold techniques or strategies from folks who want to use them. Although once they did experiment with something else:

He once zapped some of his plants with an X-ray machine to see if he could cause their mutation. Another time he stormed into his greenhouse with a hammer and pounded some of his buds—hoping to shock them into spontaneous change. (Neither experiment worked.)

Ok, so percussive genetics didn't pan out. That said, I have seen a plant made with ultrasound, so it's not entirely unlikely to work…

But focus on the time and the rate for this one cherry: conventional breeding by the top specialists in this field took 45 years, with a 99% failure rate. The Designer Fruit article also notes:

It's not unusual for him to wait more than 15 years to make money from a new variety. After nearly three decades of working on the peacotum, Zaiger hasn't seen any revenue from it. ""It's not get-rich-quick,"" he says. Because of those economics, his company spent about 30 years in the red, though it is now profitable.

Don't get me wrong – I think the Zaiger's Genetics work is heroic. But I wonder if we have that kind",0.7630657948999822,0.7630657948999822,0.0,0.0

256165,False,1024,"Most Americans think that miles of machine-planted row crops and crowded feedlots are required to feed everyone—that without large-scale, industrial agriculture, with its chemical inputs and GMOs, we would all starve to death.

Even people who know that organic agriculture is just as productive as industrial agriculture often think you need to have acres of land to grow all your own food. Here's why this is totally false…

How Much Land is Enough?

As any of the millions of subsistence farmers and smallholders around the world will tell you, depending on the quality of your land and the size of your family, you can grow all the food you need in a very small space.

It simply requires designing a food production system that works with natural processes to make the most of what you have. (See above image of the Russian dacha neighborhoods where everyone's yard is full of food.)

If you want to develop your land for food production, the following infographic shows just how much land is needed to be self sufficient, including generating all the solar energy you need to run your home.

According to this image, you need a mere 2 acres!

But I think their estimates for crops are actually too high.

Here are three examples of extreme productivity on very little land:

Growing Power – On a 2-acre urban lot in Milwaukee, Will Allen grows over a million pounds of food every year, including thousands of fish, and a livestock inventory of chickens, goats, and bees.

Using techniques and principles in the resources below, you can potentially grow all your food on as little as a quarter of an acre! Most people in the suburbs could start living off their land today!

Resources for Small Scale Self-Sufficiency

Planning and Maintaining Your Homestead

In recent years, homesteading and self-sufficiency have become popular—even trendy—and dozens of books have popped up that promise to teach you how to do it all.

My favorite of these are The Suburban Micro-Farm, The Backyard Homestead and Your Custom Homestead.

Your Custom Homestead doesn't really teach you gardening or homesteading skills. Rather, it takes you through a 21-day process that moves you closer to your homesteading dreams, whether you live in an apartment in the city, or on 100 acres in the middle of nowhere.

This book examines different motivations for homesteading, defines exactly what modern-day homesteading means, and then takes you through the prep-work and actual processes of beginning a homesteading lifestyle that will perfectly fit your unique situation.

The US economy grew faster than expected in the third quarter, boosted by a rise in exports and a jump in government defence spending.

Annual growth of 3.5% was stronger than the 3% forecast by economists although a slowdown from the 4.6% pace in the second quarter when activity rebounded after the disruption of severe winter storms in the early months of the year.

An improved trade performance contributed to growth between July and September, with export growth of 7.8% outpacing imports, which fell by 1.7%.

Government spending rose by 10%, following a 16% boost to defence spending, according to the data from the US Bureau of Economic Analysis.

Defence spending added 0.66 percentage points to the growth figure, increasing at its fastest rate for five years as the US mounted air strikes against Islamic State militants in Syria and Iraq.

However, the pace of growth in business investment, housing and consumer spending slowed from the second quarter, economists said. Consumer spending growth slipped to 1.8% from 2.5% in the previous three months. Fixed investment slowed to 4.7% from 9.5%.

""The report was broadly constructive, but with weakness emerging in housing and consumption spending, we expect the pace of growth to slip further in the fourth quarter,"" said Millan Mulraine, deputy chief economist at TD Securities in New York.

The better-than-expected overall growth figure echoed the upbeat assessment on the US economy from the Federal Reserve chair, Janet Yellen, a day earlier. Calling time on the central bank's $4.5tn bond-buying programme, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) suggested recovery was on track with the economy expanding at a ""moderate pace"".

Monetary policy would remain loose, it said, with interest rates likely to remain at a record low range of 0% to 0.25% for a ""considerable time"".

However, the growth figures and upbeat assessment raised expectations the Fed might increase rates sooner rather than later, sending the dollar to its highest level in more than three weeks against a basket of currencies.

""The current and projected pace of economic growth is one of the reasons why we still expect the Fed to begin hiking interest rates earlier next year than is widely appreciated, with an increase next March still a distinct possibility,"" said Paul Ashworth, chief US economist at Capital Economics.

Investors were feeling cautious as they considered the consequences of the third-quarter growth figures and the FOMC's statement. US markets opened slightly lower before regaining ground. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.9% and the S&P 500 was up 0.2%. In the UK, the FTSE 100 was roughly flat.

The International Monetary Fund has forecast the US economy will grow by 2.2% in 2014 overall, the same rate as 2013, and by 3.1% in 2015.

Nancy Curtin, chief investment officer of Close Brothers Asset Management, said: ""Our view that the US is recovering but not strong enough to trigger a reassessment of still benign monetary policy. The slow path to rate rises in 2015 remains. US growth is good for the world and augurs well for continued improvement in US earnings as we head into the fourth quarter."" Anna Stupnytska, global economist at Fidelity Worldwide Investment, said the Fed would be in no hurry to raise borrowing costs in the absence of inflationary or wage pressures. US inflation is currently running at 1.7% on the consumer price index and is expected to fall further as lower oil prices feed through.",0.32643335676736807,0.7264333567673681,-0.30000000000000004,-0.1

257268,False,1024,"Wednesday night, July 20, in Cleveland

Cavs' owner Dan Gilbert's super-private suite at Quicken Loans Arena has a view of the floor but cannot be viewed from any angle in the arena in which the 3-day-old GOP convention seethed and often grew frenzied as Wednesday night's preliminaries to the fourth ballot got underway.

When Gilbert ushered his friend and Ohio Gov. John Kasich into the suite, Kasich was still firmly in third place behind developer Donald Trump and Texas Sen. Ted Cruz. Cruz was already seated, flanked by his towering and ever-smiling father, Pastor Rafael Cruz. At 77, the pastor was a decade and a half older than the governor and the governor roughly that much older than the senator.

""Thanks, Dan,"" said Kasich to Gilbert as he nodded the friend of downtown Cleveland and Detroit out the door, past waiting Secret Service and Ohio State Highway patrolmen with their distinctive charcoal grey campaign hats, gray shirts and black ties, every bit as grim as the mood inside the Republican National Committee suites one floor up.

""Hello, Ted. Pastor, thanks for joining us,"" began the Buckeye State governor.

""Look, here's the deal,"" Kasich continued. ""We are stuck. And it isn't going anywhere except south unless you and I come out of here in an hour or less with a plan and a deal, and I have a proposal.""

""I'm not sure about that John,"" interrupted the Texas senator. ""I've picked up strength each of the past two ballots.""

""And so have I, Ted. And we have both topped out. But hear me out. Pastor, help me out here, right? Senior man in the negotiation goes first, right?"" Kasich got a smile and an approving nod from Cruz senior.

""That's why I asked you to bring your dad, Ted. He's been around. We learn things as the years go by. Here's what I have learned.""

""We are each going to be president or neither of us are, and that means this.""

""We come out of here and declare Kasich-Cruz is a ticket or we watch the gears grind down for six, seven ballots and hell breaks loose outside and eventually they ask Mitt or Paul Ryan and I don't even know if they take it by then. Trump's 700 are never going for you or me and my guys aren't going for you and your guys aren't going for me. That's just the way it is. That's the reality. That's what governors deal with, facts as they are, not as they'd like them to be.""

""John, wait a minute...""

""Ted, just hear me out, okay. Two minutes. That's all.""

""Look at the polls. I kill Hillary. You and I win 40 states, maybe more. Even if you pull this out after this fiasco you'll lose 40. Simple facts. Your team knows the numbers better than any of our groups. They know and I know you have a Hail Mary play but that's it. Versus a near sure thing as my No. 2.""

""And here's the deal. I will make it clear, tonight, that you are an eight-year VP and the party is going to nominate you in 2024. Of course that isn't a legal deal but we write it the right way and everyone will be nodding and agreeing. You have eight years in the vice presidency to travel the world and learn everything you need to know to pick up after I come back here for Buckeyes football and to see my girls get married and have my grandchildren. You're 53 and you are president for eight years. That's 16 years of history, Ted, not six months. Sixteen years. It was Nixon's choice and he jumped at it, made use of every minute. He wasn't Ike's equal and you won't be mine, but you'll be a key player and you will be the nominee in 2024 with a chance of winning, not a certain loser in two days or four months.""

""Now, I know it's hard. You beat me up and down the map, but truth is the party as a whole is center-right, that center-right is the dominant half of the party right now and Trump is the guy who opened the door for you. You know you need eight years with these guys to fix things or they will kill your campaign in the cradle. If you even get out of here with the nomination, and I don't think it is going that way. I just don't. I didn't bring Weaver in here because you know all this better than he does and he knows it better than anyone. You aren't getting it and if by some miracle you do, Mitch and the gang will kill you dead in the cradle.""

Washington lawmakers are demanding an accounting of how many airport security badges have been lost or stolen around the country as an NBC News investigation reveals the problem may be bigger than originally thought.

""Clearly there are an awful lot of things falling through the cracks and there's just no room for error when it comes to this issue. We need answers. They're not providing them,"" said Sen. John Thune (R-S.D.), who chairs the Transportation Committee.

Thune and two other committee members have sent a letter to the Transportation Security Administration seeking more information.

As NBCDFW reported in March, more than 1,400 of the badges — which allow employees to access secure areas like runways and boarding gates — went missing at Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport over approximately two years.

Now, the station, in partnership with NBC San Diego, has learned that more than 270 badges went missing at the San Diego International Airport in the last two years.

And some of those wayward badges were not reported for weeks or months — meaning they were not quickly deactivated.

Workers are supposed to report a missing badge within 24 hours, and the San Diego airport authority said it plans to do more to ensure that rule is followed.

The TSA said many airports have extra layers of security so workers need a code or handprint to get in, not just an ID badge. The agency said it's also working to step up background checks and random searches of workers who have ID badges nationwide.

256977,True,717,"Hillary Clinton's grip on the nomination is hardly threatened by Bernie Sanders winning West Virginia. But she sure is having trouble generating excitement.

And the reason has to do with her incremental approach to the presidency. It may be sensible and realistic, but it's a snooze. While Sanders is drawing huge crowds who are feeling the Bern, Clinton is running a position-paper campaign -- that is, when she's not deflecting the latest broadside from Donald Trump.

Maybe that helps explain why she's won 23 states and he's won 19, although hers are much bigger and have given her a virtually insurmountable delegate lead.

Clinton's not-so-subtle argument running against Trump is that she's a tested leader who wouldn't do crazy stuff. But much of what she talks about is tweaking government—and tweaking doesn't get the voters' pulse rate up.

Take a release I got the other day on Clinton's ""bold new goal"": Limiting child-care costs to no more than 10 percent of a family's income. She would boost the salaries of child-care workers by creating the Respect And Increased Salaries for Early Childhood Educators (RAISE) initiative. She would increase child care on campuses by spending $235 million more on the Child Care Access Means Parents in School Program (CCAMPIS). She would give student parents scholarships of up to $1,500 through the Student Parents in America Raising Kids (SPARK) program.

All this sound like more bureaucracy and more federal spending, if not at the wildly expensive Sanders free-college-for-all level.

As the Washington Post smartly noted the other day, Clinton would crack down on Wall Street by expanding a regulatory form—one that is already 42 pages long and can require up to 300 hours to fill out.

Clinton wants to give students a tax credit worth up to $2,500, the paper noted, if they fill out Form 1098-T and Form 8863 and make a series of calculations.

On some issues, like free trade, Sanders has pulled her to the left. And she veered left the other day on health care, where Bernie famously doesn't think ObamaCare goes far enough and wants a single-payer health system run by the government.

Clinton this week came out for a public option that would give those 50 or 55 and up the opportunity to buy into the Medicare program, which would be a large step toward government-run health care—and miles from what she pushed as first lady.

She is the opposite of a bumper-sticker candidate. She uses many words but rarely utters memorable phrases.

Trump, of course, is having his own stutter-steps on policy. Having proposed a massive tax cut that by some estimates would add up to $10 trillion to the deficit over the next decade, his campaign has asked CNBC anchor Larry Kudlow and former Wall Street Journal writer Stephen Moore for suggestions on bringing down the cost.

In the end, the election isn't likely to be decided on specific policy positions. He will run to her left on some issues, especially military intervention. Clinton and Trump offer dramatically contrasting styles, one a cautious creature of government, the other a bombastic businessman who denounces government.

Many critics say Trump , who told the New York Times the primaries gave him a ""mandate"" to be provocative, needs to tone it down. But perhaps Hillary needs to dial it up.",0.6792701138245489,0.6792701138245489,0.0,0.0

Well, yes; Tobias Lindberg attended his first practice as a Toronto Marlie, but someone else made an unexpected appearance....

So, what's going on? Is this like that episode of Seinfeld where George shows up for work in the hopes everyone will just forget that he quit the day before?

Not quite; Matt Frattin is still technically an Ottawa Senator, but the organization has loaned him back to the Marlies, as teams are allowed to do. His NHL rights remain with Ottawa, but as long as he's in the AHL, at least for the foreseeable future, he'll remain in Toronto.

The details of this bizarre transaction- such as who is actually paying him, and how long the loan will last- are unclear at this point.

Mattress, also known as Once Upon a Mattress, is the twelfth episode of Glee's first season and the twelfth episode overall. It premiered on December 2, 2009.

When the Glee Club is left out of the yearbook because of budget cuts, everyone seems to be relieved that they won't have to suffer the ridicule of years past. Everyone except Rachel, who wants her legacy cemented in print. Meanwhile, Quinn makes it her mission to be in the Cheerios yearbook photo despite her pregnancy, and Terri and Will's relationship is shaken to its core.

The episode was directed by Elodie Keene and written by Ryan Murphy.

Plot

Will sits with Emma and Ken in the teacher's lounge. They tell him that their wedding will be the following Saturday, on the same day as Sectionals. Sue walks in with a pair of black eyes, the result of having some work done prior to yearbook pictures. Sue tells Will she convinced Figgins not to allow Glee Club to have a yearbook picture this year.

In the choir room, Kurt explains to everyone that not having a yearbook picture may save from them countless hours of ridicule. Everyone seems to agree, at which point Will comes in and promises them he will fight to get their picture in the yearbook.

When Will complains to Figgins, the principal tells him his only option is to buy a quarter-page ad for Glee for $325. That will be enough room for two members. Figgins suggest he pick Finn and Santana, since they are least likely to have their faces vandalized. Rachel barges into the room demanding Glee have a picture before Will tells her the news.

Rachel explains in a voiceover that she has joined every club possible in order to get her picture in the yearbook dozens of times. Unlike her other clubs however, Rachel is particularly proud of Glee.

Quinn is watching Santana and Brittany as they look trough the yearbook and is saddened she's not on the Cheerios anymore. She decides, she wants to be on the squad again once the yearbook photos are being taken.

Terri tells Will that he cannot use family funds to buy the ad for Glee. Will writes Figgins a check anyway, but asks him to wait a few days before cashing it.

Will tells New Directions they must pick two team captains for the photo. Every single vote is for Rachel, and

nobody else wants to be in the picture as they are all afraid of being defaced and ridiculed.

Will asks Emma how to find another kid to be in the picture. She apologizes for having to miss sectionals, and Will thinks Ken scheduled the wedding conflict on purpose. Emma defends Ken and Will ends up apologizing.

Will asks Rachel to pick a co-captain. Everyone she contacts comes up with bogus excuses. Eventually she's able to convince Finn to do the picture with her. Rachel says she is going to teach Finn how to smile correctly via them singing a duo of Lily Allen's Smile.

Several of Finn's football teammates tell him they are already planning to deface his Glee picture. Finn ends up not showing up for the photo shoot and Rachel was about to give up but decided to take the picture without him. (When You're Smiling). When the photographer tells Rachel he is directing a commercial, she convinces him to cast her and the glee club. Rachel tells Glee clubbers she's landed them their first ""big break."" The commercial is for mattresses and all the guys are excited.

During the read-through, Rachel is able to convince the storeowner to let them sing a mattress-hopping version ofas thecommercial instead of a cheesy scenario.

While looking for his pocket square, Will finds one of Terri's old fake pregnancy bellies. Furious, he goes to the kitchen and demands she show him her belly. The discovery leads to a huge fight, with Terri explaining the origins of the lie and telling him about adopting Quinn's baby. ""I loved you Terri,"" he says. ""I really loved you."" and he storms out of the apartment.

At school Will finds a stack of new mattresses given to Glee from the storeowner. He opens one and puts it in his office, in order to spend the night there.

Police say they have identified a 15-year-old boy suspected of setting off fireworks that may have sparked a massive wildfire raging outside Portland, Ore.

""It is believed he and others may have been using fireworks which started the forest fire along the Eagle Creek Trail,"" Oregon State Police said in a news release.

Authorities say an investigation is still underway into the blaze that started Saturday and has so far consumed more than 30,000 acres of forestland, choking the air and raining down ash on the nearby metropolitan area.

No charges have been filed, and police are asking anyone with information about the cause of the blaze to step forward. But fire officials say they are certain it is human-caused.

""I saw this boy lob a smoke bomb down into the ravine,"" hiker Liz FitzGerald told Willamette Week. ""I saw his friend or a guy that was there with him videotaping it with his phone. I looked over, and I said, 'Do you realize how dangerous that is?' ""

FitzGerald said she got out of harm's way and helped police track down the group of teenagers.

The flames have led to the closure of part of Interstate 84. Hundreds of homes have been evacuated so far in Oregon and neighboring Washington state, and officials say more could be coming.

""Fire burning right along a major interstate, closing 40 miles of road, threatening homes — this is a big deal,"" Dave Thompson, a spokesman for the Oregon Department of Transportation told The Oregonian. ""This happened fairly suddenly. It blew up.""

The blaze, ignited along a popular hiking trail, moved quickly enough to strand more than 140 hikers Saturday in the Columbia River Gorge National Scenic Area, according to local media.

The Spokesman-Review reports that the hikers banded together to ensure nobody was left behind, and that when one person struggled, the group would stop to provide assistance. An Air Force medic and a U.S. Forest Service worker met up with the group and helped coordinate a rescue.

Firefighters hovering overhead in a helicopter were able to lower directions toward a safe passage via a yellow ribbon.

As the group tried to make its way out, according to the newspaper, the flames came as close as 300 yards. They hiked into the night, some people using their cellphones to light the way over creeks and bridges. At one point, they lay down to rest.

""Some people were trembling. We were all cold on the ground,"" hiker Merribeth Midtlyng told the newspaper. ""A bear actually came into our area and no one stirred. ... After all we'd been through, it seemed irrelevant to our circumstances.""

A group of firefighters armed with provisions reportedly reached the group by early morning Sunday and led them 11 miles toward waiting buses that took them to safety.

Oregon Public Broadcasting reported Wednesday that the fire was at 0 percent containment. Fire officials say the estimated containment date is not until the end of the month.

""Though fire activity slowed Wednesday morning, it still threatens numerous communities, tourist attractions and resources in Oregon's scenic Columbia River Gorge. Those include the Bull Run Watershed, the source of 1 in 5 Oregonians' drinking water,"" OPB reports.

Since it began over the weekend, the Eagle Creek Fire has merged with a second blaze, called the Indian Creek Fire. On Tuesday night, the Multnomah County Sheriff's Office tweeted that ""the fire has slowed way down for now.""

The National Weather Service Portland said early Wednesday that thanks to shifting winds, the ash that had been raining down on parts of the city Tuesday should be ending and that the air quality should be improving.

The Eagle Creek Fire is one of dozens of wildfires burning across the Western United States. The Oregonian has compiled an interactive map of all of the current active wildfires across the West.

The New York Times reports:

""Jessica Jones"" has shown an audience appeal beyond some ""superhero shows"" — in part, of course, because the title character, uncannily portrayed by Krysten Ritter, is a failed superhero turned superpowered noir detective.

The June 1998 note says bin Laden ""might take the course of least resistance and turn to a civilian [aircraft] target.""

The warning came from a U.S. regional security officer, diplomatic officials and a civil aviation official in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. It was based on a public threat from bin Laden against ""military passenger aircraft."" The memo, however, said that bin Laden did ""not differentiate between those dressed in military uniforms and civilians,"" NBC News' Robert Windrem reported.

The Sept. 11 Commission, a panel appointed by Congress in 2002 to investigate U.S. security, made no mention of the memo in any of its reports, Windrem said. It is unknown why the report did not address the warning.

The document was first disclosed by Washington Post editor Bob Woodward, in his behind-the-scenes book, ""Bush at War,"" written in 2004. It was made public on Friday by the National Security Archive, a private group that uses Freedom of Information requests to obtain classified data.

On Friday, the National Security Archive also released a letter from former CIA Director George Tenet written five days after Sept. 11. Titled ""We're at War,"" the letter to top deputies urges an ""unrelenting focus"" on using all of America's capabilities, ""not only to protect the U.S. both here and abroad from additional terrorist attacks — but also, and more importantly, to neutralize and destroy al-Qaida and its partners.""

The Sept. 16 letter was written in the wake of criticism directed at Tenet and the CIA for the agency's shortcomings in preventing an assault on U.S. soil.

There have been a slew of reports over the past decade of plots to use planes to strike American targets. In 1995, U.S. and Filipino authorities uncovered a plot by Ramsey Yusef, nephew of Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, the mastermind behind Sept. 11. Yusef threatened to hide bombs on planes and blow them up over the Pacific.

The most notable security warning, Windrem said, was a presidential briefing on an Aug. 6, 2000, that mentioned the possibility of passenger airliners being used in terrorist attacks.",0.8292863810647015,0.8292863810647015,0.0,0.0

SLF4J allows the end-user to plug in the desired logging framework at deployment time. Note that SLF4J-enabling your library/application implies the addition of only a single mandatory dependency, namely slf4j-api-1.8.0-beta2.jar.

since 1.6.0 If no binding is found on the class path, then SLF4J will default to a no-operation implementation.

since 1.7.0 Printing methods in the Logger interface now offer variants accepting varargs instead of Object[] . This change implies that SLF4J requires JDK 1.5 or later. Under the hood the Java compiler transforms the varargs part in methods into Object[] . Thus, the Logger interface generated by the compiler is indistinguishable in 1.7.x from its 1.6.x counterpart. It follows that SLF4J version 1.7.x is totally 100% no-ifs-or-buts compatible with SLF4J version 1.6.x.

since 1.7.5 Significant improvement in logger retrieval times. Given the extent of the improvement, users are highly encouraged to migrate to SLF4J 1.7.5 or later.

since 1.7.9 By setting the slf4j.detectLoggerNameMismatch system property to true, SLF4J can automatically spot incorrectly named loggers.

Hello World

As customary in programming tradition, here is an example illustrating the simplest way to output ""Hello world"" using SLF4J. It begins by getting a logger with the name ""HelloWorld"". This logger is in turn used to log the message ""Hello World"".

import org.slf4j.Logger; import org.slf4j.LoggerFactory; public class HelloWorld { public static void main(String[] args) { Logger logger = LoggerFactory.getLogger(HelloWorld.class); logger.info(""Hello World""); } }

To run this example, you first need to download the slf4j distribution, and then to unpack it. Once that is done, add the file slf4j-api-1.8.0-beta2.jar to your class path.

Compiling and running HelloWorld will result in the following output being printed on the console.

SLF4J: Failed to load class ""org.slf4j.impl.StaticLoggerBinder"". SLF4J: Defaulting to no-operation (NOP) logger implementation SLF4J: See http://www.slf4j.org/codes.html#StaticLoggerBinder for further details.

This warning is printed because no slf4j binding could be found on your class path.

The warning will disappear as soon as you add a binding to your class path. Assuming you add slf4j-simple-1.8.0-beta2.jar so that your class path contains:

slf4j-api-1.8.0-beta2.jar

slf4j-simple-1.8.0-beta2.jar

Compiling and running HelloWorld will now result in the following output on the console.

0 [main] INFO HelloWorld - Hello World

Typical usage pattern

The sample code below illustrates the typical usage pattern for SLF4J. Note the use of {}-placeholders on line 15. See the question ""What is the fastest way of logging?"" in the FAQ for more details.

1: import org.slf4j.Logger; 2: import org.slf4j.LoggerFactory; 3: 4: public class Wombat { 5: 6: final Logger logger = LoggerFactory.getLogger(Wombat.class); 7: Integer t; 8: Integer oldT; 9: 10: public void setTemperature(Integer temperature) { 11: 12: oldT = t; 13: t = temperature; 14: 15: logger.debug(""Temperature set to {}.

Binding with a logging framework at deployment time

As mentioned previously, SLF4J supports various logging frameworks. The SLF4J distribution ships with several jar files referred to as ""SLF4J bindings"",",0.0,0.635461278718024,-6.1000000000000005,-0.1
259708,False,1024,"In Venezuela, there was a brief, bright moment when Edward Snowden, the N.S.A. leaker, was expected to land suddenly at Simón Bolívar International Airport, jet-lagged and red-eyed but safe and sound and victorious. His slipping out of Moscow and crossing the world would have been seen as a remarkable act of defiance against the power of the American government. Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro had offered him asylum after visiting Russia for the Gas Exporting Countries Forum, at the beginning of July. He declared that Snowden had done nothing wrong and was being subjected to a ""crazy manhunt"" by the United States authorities, and promised to protect him once he arrived in Caracas. It is probably no accident that Maduro made the announcement on July 5th, Venezuela's independence day.

Domestic critics argued that Maduro should have given priority to repairing the country's relationship with the United States, damaged after long years of quarreling under his predecessor, the late Hugo Chávez, particularly after both countries withdrew their ambassadors in 2010. Others speculated that a hero's welcome for Snowden would give a much-needed boost to Maduro's popularity. It was also suggested that Snowden would be exchanged for Luis Posada Carriles, a terrorist of Cuban extraction now living in Miami, who Venezuela has been seeking to extradite for blowing up a Cubana Airlines plane in 1976, killing seventy-three people. Or that the Cubans would get their hands on him, and then exchange him for the remaining four members of the Cuban Five—agents convicted in Florida for espionage. Laureano Márquez, a prominent comedian and opposition columnist, wrote that Maduro had expelled the filmmaker Tim Tracy, accusing him without evidence of being a spy for the C.I.A., in order to bring in Snowden, a full-time, real spy.

The impact Snowden's presence might have on the relationship between the United States and Venezuela was a constant topic of discussion for both Chavistas and the opposition. Speculation about possible U.S. retaliations ran from cancelling the visas of high-level officials to stopping purchases of Venezuelan oil.

There's no doubt that Snowden would have been a valuable asset for the Venezuelan government, which is seeking to legitimize itself after elections in April were questioned by the opposition, and which has lost much of the glow and potency Chávez conferred to it. But after keeping Venezuela waiting for a formal reply, Snowden, who has now been languishing for a month in Moscow's Sheremetyevo Airport, made the surprise announcement that he will stay in the land of Pussy Riot—and Putin—until the conditions for his journey are more favorable.

At that, the Snowden case disappeared almost instantaneously from Venezuelan media, enveloped in the most rotund official silence. Several government officials asked for comment said that the only people authorized to speak about the case were the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Elías Jaua, and Maduro himself.

Last Thursday, the newspaper ABC de España disclosed that Secretary of State John Kerry had called Jaua on Friday, July 12th, to talk about the Venezuelan offer. The newspaper described Kerry's tone as intimidating, and said that the Secretary of State had threatened Jaua with bold actions against Venezuela if the asylum materialized. Among other things, these steps would include stopping the sale of gasoline and other oil derivatives from Venezuela and suspending U.S. visas for diplomats, officials, and businessmen. On Friday, an unnamed State Department source told the D.P.A. news agency that, indeed, there had been a call, but that it was ""completely untrue"" that Kerry had bullied Jaua or given details about possible sanctions. The Venezuelan government's silence was regarded as an implicit acknowledgement that the issue is too delicate to risk any miscalculation that might worsen the impasse.

The fragile truce was broken when Obama's nominee for United Nations ambassador, Samantha Power, promised before a Senate committee last Wednesday that she would stand up against ""repressive regimes"" and ""the crackdown on civil society being carried out in countries like Cuba, Iran, Russia, and Venezuela.""

The remarks infuriated Maduro, who, in a full bravado, responded, ""As president, my policy is zero tolerance for any attacks the Gringos make on Venezuela. I'm not going to tolerate any sort of aggression against Venezuela—verbal, political, or diplomatic. That's enough! You there with your empire. No more meddling with Venezuela."" Venezuela, he said, was suspending ongoing talks to improve relations with the U.S. He also reaffirmed his willingness to give asylum to Snowden, since ""the right to asylum is an international humanitarian right, and Venezuela has always respected it.""

Maduro, that is to say, found it more convenient to step back to the previous status quo than to move forward and regularize the relations. By doing so, he can claim that he cares enough about the nationalistic values",0.6043531804069515,0.8043531804069515,-0.2,0.0
257228,True,545,"THE Van Allen belts, which were discovered in 1958 by some of the first artificial satellites, are a bane of those satellites' successors. The outer belt, which begins at an altitude of 13,000km above Earth's surface and goes up to 60,000km, is full of energetic electrons. The inner one, at 1,000-6,000km, is full of energetic protons. Both play havoc with satellites' electronics.

But what if you could sweep them away? This is the ambition of Reinhard Friedel, a physicist at Los Alamos National Laboratory, in New Mexico, and his colleagues. Dr Friedel reckons you could do the job with radio waves. In principle this should work because the gap between the inner and outer belts is maintained by natural radio waves from things like lightning.

Get our daily newsletter Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.


Particles in the Van Allen belts are constantly on the move, following the lines of Earth's magnetic field towards the poles, gyrating as they travel. As they approach a pole, however, the laws of electrodynamics that govern the behaviour of gyrating particles force them to reverse their direction and head back towards the opposite pole. If a particle is moving towards a pole faster, it will come closer to Earth before bounding back and is more likely to hit an air molecule. If it does so it is, to use the jargon, ""precipitated"" into the atmosphere where it gives up its energy and never returns to space.

So the way to sweep the Van Allen belts clean of their troublesome electrons and protons is to bombard the particles with radio waves at a frequency that speeds them up as they head towards the poles. Protons are heavy and influencing them requires a lot of power. So sweeping the inner belt may be impractical. Electrons, however, are much lighter. That means a space-borne particle-sweeper for the outer Van Allen belt is a possibility, according to Dr Friedel. He reckons it would cost about $500m to launch and operate for 15 years. Not all satellites would benefit. But many, including all the geostationary communications satellites, have to contend with electrons in the outer belt. Sweeping could extend the life of all GPS satellites by two years, saving about $22m per satellite, or $660m in all.

The scheme is ambitious, but not foolhardy. Some talk of clearing larger chunks of space debris to stop them crashing into satellites. That would be hard. Sweeping away the cloud of electrons that surrounds Earth could be a better investment.",0.7961196827781114,0.7961196827781114,0.0,0.0

Of the 33 rockets that hit Israel on Sunday, three were Grad-type Katyusha missiles and the rest were Qassams.

An Israeli woman suffered light shrapnel wounds when a Katyusha slammed directly into a house in Ashkelon late Sunday afternoon. Another person on the scene was treated for shock.

Earlier Sunday, an Israeli man was also wounded by shrapnel when a Qassam hit a western Negev factory, sparking a fire. Several other people were treated for shock.

Meanwhile, at least 70 Palestinians have been killed since early Saturday in the IDF's operation in Gaza.

Two Qassam rockets struck Sderot on Sunday evening - one hit an electric pole and the other exploded in the street. There were no injuries, but some damage was caused to nearby homes.

In addition to the direct strike on the Ashkelon house, another Katyusha and a Qassam hit southern Israel on Sunday afternoon. The Katyusha struck in a western Negev community, causing some damage to a local structure. It is unclear where the third rocket landed.

Two of the rockets fired earlier in the day hit the western Negev town of Sderot, damaging homes and leaving several people suffering from shock.

A rocket also scored a direct hit on a house in a western Negev kibbutz, damaging the building. The family was not home at the time.

A Katyusha struck the tomb of the late Rabbi Baba Sali in Netivot earlier in the day, causing no injuries or damage.

Over the weekend dozens of Qassam rockets and Katyushas were fired at Ashkelon, Sderot and communities bordering the Gaza Strip. Seven Israeli civilians were lightly wounded.

Ashkelon resident vows: 'We will not turn into Sderot'

Ashkelon's mayor said on Sunday he would not accept the rockets becoming a normal reality.

""This is a state of war, I know no other definition for it,"" said Roni Mahatzri, from his makeshift office in an underground bunker. ""If it lasts a week or two, we can handle that, but we have no intention of allowing this to become part of our daily routine.""

That seemed to be the major concern for most residents.

""We will not turn into Sderot,"" Shimoni said, referring to the town that has suffered most of the rocket attacks over the past seven years. The rockets have killed 13 people, wounded dozens more, caused millions of dollars in damage and made daily life unbearable.

Ashkelon residents took to the street on Saturday night urging government action against the Gaza militants.

On Sunday, the city was relatively calm, with foreign dignitaries visiting to convey support, and maintenance crews diligently collecting debris and paving over craters left by rockets hitting parking lots.

The mayor said attendance in schools was nearly perfect, and, though it was the talk of the town, residents didn't seem too panicked by the weekend developments.",0.734657899263714,0.834657899263714,-0.1,0.0

a studio known as 'Probendi', owns the iWatch trademark in Europe, the company filed a suit on the 26th of June this year after discovering that the Apple Watch is the first thing that pops up when you look up the 'iWatch' in search engines.

The court document was obtained by Bloomberg, which says: ""Apple has systematically used iWatch wording on Google search engine in order to direct customers to its own website, advertising Apple Watch"". According to the studio, the iWatch trademark should be worth around $97 million.

Apparently, Probendi brought up its concerns with Apple last year though the company never replied. That said, it has avoided using the term iWatch publicly and in marketing materials, so it hasn't really done anything wrong legally. The studio also got in touch with Google over the search rankings, though Google claimed that it is not responsible for links on its page.

A hearing over this lawsuit is set to take place on the 11th of November. Probendi was working on its own Android Wear smartwatch, which would have been called the iWatch, though these plans have been put on hold for the time being.

KitGuru Says: This lawsuit seems pretty flimsy. Apple has not publicly referred to its smartwatch as the iWatch and therefore, isn't really impeding on the trademarked name.

Jerusalem (AFP) - Safety fears have forced the cancellation of Canadian rocker Neil Yong's impending concert in Tel Aviv, the target of repeated rocket fire from Gaza in the past week, organisers said Sunday.

Concert promoter Shuki Weiss announced ""with great sorrow"" the cancellation of a show scheduled for Tel Aviv's riverside Yarkon Park next Thursday.

""This is due to the rocket attacks of recent days and the fear for the audience's safety in a mass event,"" he wrote on his Facebook page.

Since last Tuesday when Israel launched its Operation Protective Edge deadly air war to stop Palestinians firing rockets into southern Israel, the militants have increased the intensity and range of their barrages.

As in previous days, air raid sirens sent Tel Aviv residents sprinting to bomb shelters on Sunday and Israel's Iron Dome missile defence system blew up incoming rockets in the skies above. None have so far hit inside the city limits.

Police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld told AFP that the concert was called off after consultation with civil defence authorities, ""in regard to large gatherings in central populated areas due to the security dangers involved.""

Young last played in Israel in 1993, appearing with Pearl Jam.

He has resisted calls to boycott Israel and fans were looking forward to his return, this time with his band Crazy Horse.

Haaretz on Sunday said that other forthcoming visits in danger were those of Paul Anka, on July 24 and 26, and the Backstreet Boys, scheduled to play three dates on July 29-31.

""Let's be clear, this was an attempted terrorist attack,"" New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said.

Police said the explosion happened in an underground passageway under 42nd Street between 7th and 8th Avenues, with first responders notified around 7:20 a.m. ET. The blast filled the passageway, crowded with throngs of Monday morning commuters, with smoke.

Officials said a man transported an ""improvised, low-tech"" explosive device attached to his body and set it off. He suffered injuries, as did three people nearby.

James O'Neill, NYPD commissioner, identified the suspect as Akayed Ullah, 27. He suffered lacerations and was transported to Bellevue Hospital.

The device was based on a pipe bomb and affixed with Velcro and zip ties.

'It was fairly orderly'

This undated photo provided by the New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission shows Akayed Ullah, the suspect in Monday's incident. (New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission via AP) Kelly said Ullah did make statements after the attempt, but would not specify any political motives or any affiliations or sympathies with militant groups.

Officials told The Associated Press that Ullah lives in Brooklyn and came to the U.S. from Bangladesh about seven years ago on an F-4 visa, a preferential visa available for those with family in the U.S. who are citizens or permanent residents. The officials spoke to AP on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly about the blast.

White House spokesperson Sarah Huckabee Sanders said on Monday afternoon that the explosion shows the need for ""immigration reform"" and that Congress should work with the president, stressing the need to ""protect our borders."" Sanders also called for a ""merit-based"" immigration system, although it's not clear if that would have disqualified Ullah.

Ullah had been licensed to drive a livery cab between 2012 and 2015, according to the NYC Taxi and Limousine Commission, but let the licence lapse.

Ullah lived with his father, mother and brother in a residential area of Brooklyn with a large Bangladeshi community, neighbours said.

The Bangladesh Embassy in Washington condemned the attack. The deputy chief of mission, Mahbub Hassan Saleh, said the embassy had not received any information from authorities about the suspect.

'I was freaking out'

The incident was captured on transit system video, which investigators will analyze. They said they had not uncovered any additional plans or activities related to the bombing.

Elrana Peralta, a customer service worker for Greyhound, said she works in the Port Authority terminal complex near where the blast happened, but did not hear the explosion.

""All we could hear was the chaos,"" she said. ""We could hear people yelling, 'Get out! Get out! Get out!""'

John Miles, 28, from Vermont, was waiting for a bus to Massachusetts. He also did not hear the blast, but saw police react.

""I didn't know what was going on. Officers were running around. I was freaking out,"" he said. There was an announcement that people should take their bags and leave. ""They didn't incite panic. It was fairly orderly.""

De Blasio also said there were no credible, specific threats to the city in general.

Gov. Andrew Cuomo praised law enforcement agencies and expressed gratitude the incident was not as life threatening as it could have been, given the time of the incident at the busy transportation node.

The Port Authority bus terminal was closed after the incident, but reopened about two hours later. Subway service was gradually being restored, and officials didn't anticipate any disruptions related to the incident for the late afternoon commute.",0.0,0.8013212795679767,-1.8,-0.1

I am referring to the pay-cut the Australian rugby players have accepted, this following the news that their union is practically bankrupt. The only reason the Wallabies got any salaries this year, is thanks to the British and Irish Lions tour, which made some a good bit of bob. Earlier indications from within Australia seem to show that Australian Rugby shows a larger deficit every year. The last reported deficit was around 19 million Ausie Dollars (R180 million)

(FYI – For those not quite in the know, a growing deficit means that the money received by Rugby Australia is less than the money spent by Rugby Australia, and can be likened to an overdraft. An increasing overdraft, without ever looking to be in a position to repay such overdraft, is why the Australians are introducing these cuts)

The two-day Cannabis Canada Forum was organized by licensed marijuana producers and was intended to educate the public about products and business opportunities in the soon-to-be-legal marijuana market.

Executives from Hydropothecary, a licensed medical marijuana producer located half an hour from Ottawa in Masson-Angers, Que., were among the keynote speakers during the weekend forum.

Shane Morris, one of the company's vice-presidents, said Hydropothecary expects Canada's recreational market will be worth between $5 and 8 billion when marijuana is legalized.

""Where we're seeing [regarding] our own potential here in the Gatineau-Ottawa region is we'll be in a position to grow and meet that need, take a portion of that market, and be able to reinvest into jobs, growth and development here in our facility,"" Morris said.

He said Hydropothecary's experience under the stringent medical marijuana licensing system will allow them to handle whatever regulatory burdens come with legalization.

The federal government will regulate producers, while the provinces will set out the rules around distribution and sales. The company is focused on its innovations in dry marijuana products and building an up-market clientele.

""From an Ottawa perspective, we're more of a Farm Boy, rather than some of the bigger producers, who are more of a Walmart,"" Morris said.

The 'build-out' is happening now

The conference also featured businesses other than producers, including information centres, security firms and construction companies.

Brent Glesby, a manager at Edmonton-based Thermo Design Insulation, came to the conference because his company — which engineers and builds walls that allow for climate control that conforms with food safety standards — is expanding into the marijuana market.

""There's a lot of construction projects going on. The build-out of this industry is happening right now,"" Glesby said. ""There seems to be a lot of money and finance coming into the indsutry.""

""The opportunity worldwide in the cannabis business is just remarkable,"" he said. ""There's plenty of room for everyone to get involved.""

Boveda sells packages that keep cannabis flowers from losing humidity during transportation or storage. Emmer said licensed producers began approaching the company, saying they used their product — which inspired them to create a custom container.

258469,False,1024,"Bernie Sanders has a Black Lives Matter problem, and it doesn't look like it's going away anytime soon.

Sanders makes an appealing target for the grass-roots movement — the surging presidential candidate has been drawing monster crowds on the campaign trail, giving protesters high-impact moments when they disrupt his events. And the activists say that since he holds himself out as the most progressive candidate, he is the logical champion for their cause.

Story Continued Below

But for Sanders, the headlines of hijacked events risk casting further doubt that the self-described democratic socialist can make it all the way to the White House.

While he's been winning over crowds with his fiery message of income inequality, minority voters aren't biting.

In late July, a Gallup poll showed that only 25 percent of nonwhite Democratic or Democratic-leaning voters view Sanders favorably, compared with 80 percent for front-runner Hillary Clinton.

Despite his history as a young radical promoting the civil rights movement in the 1960s, Sanders is struggling to shake his persona of a 73-year-old white guy from Vermont, a state that is 95 percent white.

""This is something that the Sanders campaign is going to have to solve because it's going to be problematic if he has any chance of winning the nomination,"" Democratic strategist and pollster Cornell Belcher said. ""Because the truth is if you can't compete and win black votes in a Democratic primary, you are not going to be the Democratic nominee. If you can't compete for black voters this means you can't win South Carolina, you can't win NC, you can't win GA, you can't win Louisiana, you can't win Mississippi.""

So far, the Black Lives Matter movement, which gained momentum during a series of shootings of unarmed black men by white police officers, has interrupted two major Sanders events, demanding that he more directly take on issues related to institutional racism in housing, education and criminal justice.

On Saturday, Sanders was awkwardly driven off the stage at a Social Security Works event in Seattle by activists who demanded to address the crowd about police brutality against African-Americans. He tried to regain the microphone, but ultimately had to leave the stage in the confusion.

Sanders spokesman Michael Briggs declined to talk overall about the incident or Sanders' plan to address the growing impact of the movement. He did say, though, that the campaign had little control over Saturday's event.

""It wasn't our event. He was the last of many speakers,"" Briggs said.

Activists from the group say that it's not anything personal against Sanders.

""It's not that we're targeting him specifically,"" California State University-Los Angeles professor Melina Abdullah, one of the leaders and an organizer of the Black Lives Matter chapter in Los Angeles said of Sanders. ""I think it's just really important to understand that these things didn't happen because there's some grand plan. It just so happened to pan out that way that Sanders has been on the receiving end twice.""

Abdullah said there's no candidate on the Republican or Democratic side of the 2016 cycle who has made racial injustice or police brutality against African-Americans ""a centerpiece of the campaign.""

Another Democratic strategist who's worked with activists in the Black Lives Movement, and asked for anonymity to speak candidly, said white progressives such as Sanders serve up liberal rhetoric but do little to tackle the more insidious forms of racism in this country.

It also helps the protesters that Sanders is drawing huge crowds in mostly liberal strongholds like Madison, Wisconsin or Seattle — something Clinton is not doing.

""Her events are not commanding 18, 15, 24,000 people in these ultraliberal places,"" the strategist said.

While Sanders took a passive approach during the weekend disruption and a prior one at the Netroots Nation conference in Arizona last month, he hasn't been ignoring the activists' concerns or minority outreach.

A week before the conference, the Sanders campaign installed Marcus Ferrell as African-American outreach coordinator. After the conference, where Sanders became visibly frustrated trying to direct his answers back to income inequality and economic issues, he made sure his social media messages were stocked with mentions of the topics the Black Lives Matter protesters were referring to.

""We want a nation where young black men and women can live without fear of being falsely arrested, beaten or killed #blacklivesmatter,"" Sanders wrote in one tweet a day after the Netroots forum. He continued: ""Sandra Bland, Eric Garner, Freddie Gray and too many others.""

Sanders' campaign also announced on Saturday that it had brought on African-American activist Symone Sanders, who has been a volunteer organizer with the Coalition of Juvenile Justice, as its national press secretary.

The campaign wasted no time in highlighting her support of the presidential candidate. Symone Sanders introduced him Saturday night before a crowd of 12,000 people at an event at the University of Washington. On Sunday night, she again introduced",0.7540711606332846,0.7540711606332846,0.0,0.0

259436,False,1024,"Multisubunit RNA polymerases IV and V (Pol IV and Pol V) evolved as specialized forms of Pol II that mediate RNA-directed DNA methylation (RdDM) and transcriptional silencing of transposons, viruses, and endogenous repeats in plants. Among the subunits common to Arabidopsis thaliana Pols II, IV, and V are 93% identical alternative ninth subunits, NRP(B/D/E)9a and NRP(B/D/E)9b. The 9a and 9b subunit variants are incompletely redundant with respect to Pol II; whereas double mutants are embryo lethal, single mutants are viable, yet phenotypically distinct. Likewise, 9a or 9b can associate with Pols IV or V but RNA-directed DNA methylation is impaired only in 9b mutants. Based on genetic and molecular tests, we attribute the defect in RdDM to impaired Pol V function. Collectively, our results reveal a role for the ninth subunit in RNA silencing and demonstrate that subunit diversity generates functionally distinct subtypes of RNA polymerases II and V.

Unlike yeast and metazoans, Arabidopsis thaliana and Populus trichocarpa (poplar) each have two genes orthologous to RBP9, and maize and rice have three ( Figure 1 and Figure S1 ). Orthologs of yeast Rpa12 and Rpc11, the Rpb9-like subunits of Pols I and III, respectively, form separate clades ( Figure 1 ). Both Arabidopsis Rpb9 orthologs copurify with affinity-purified RNA polymerases II, IV, or V (), such that their comprehensive names are NRP(B/D/E)9a and NRP(B/D/E)9b. Despite the fact that the two proteins differ at only 8 of their 114 amino acids, we show here that these ninth subunit variants are incompletely redundant for Pol II and nonredundant for Pol V functions.

Human, Drosophila, zebrafish, Chlamydomonas, Arabidopsis, poplar, maize, or rice proteins homologous to yeast (S. cerevisiae) Rpb9 (Pol II), or its Pol I or Pol III paralogs, were identified by searching the NCBI Reference Sequence (RefSeq) or maizeGBD (in the case of Zea mays GRMZM2G009673) databases using BLASTp. Multiple alignment of the sequences was conducted using MUSCLE (see Figure S1 ) in order to generate the phylogenetic tree. Bootstrap values are indicated for each branchpoint.

In yeast, the 12 Pol II subunits are each encoded by unique genes, ten of which are essential. One of the nonessential genes encodes the ninth-largest subunit, Rpb9. rpb9 deletion strains are viable, but temperature-sensitive (). Rpb9 is implicated in multiple aspects of polymerase II function, including initiation (), processivity (), transcriptional fidelity, proofreading (), and transcription-coupled DNA repair ().

Arabidopsis thaliana Pols II, IV, and V each have 12 core subunits (). Pol II, IV, and V largest subunits are encoded by unique genes: NRPB1, NRPD1, and NRPE1, respectively (""NRP"" denotes ""Nuclear RNA Polymerase""; ""B, D, and E,"" as the second, fourth, and fifth letters of the alphabet, denote Pols II, IV, or V; the numeral 1 indicates the largest subunit). Pol IV and V second-largest subunits are encoded by the same gene, NRP(D/E)2, which is distinct from the corresponding Pol II subunit gene, NRPB2 (). The two largest subunits interact to form the catalytic center for RNA synthesis, with noncatalytic subunits playing structural and regulatory roles for initiation, elongation, termination, or RNA processing (). Most of the noncatalytic subunits of Pols II, IV, and V are encoded by the same genes ().

Pol IV and Pol V functions are best understood with respect to RNA-directed DNA methylation (), a process in which 24 nt short interfering RNAs (siRNAs) direct the cytosine methylation, and silencing, of complementary DNA sequences. Pol IV acts early in the pathway, working in partnership with RNA-DEPENDENT RNA POLYMERASE 2 to produce double-stranded RNAs that are diced into siRNAs and loaded (primarily) into ARGONAUTE 4 (AGO4) (). Independent of siRNA biogenesis, Pol V generates RNA transcripts at loci that undergo RdDM () and AGO4 binds these Pol V transcripts () as well as Pol V itself ().

The 28-minute flight began at 6:22 a.m. Pacific time as the liquid-hydrogen powered aircraft lifted off its launch cart. Phantom Eye climbed to an altitude of 4,080 feet and reached a cruising speed of 62 knots. After touching down, the vehicle sustained some damage when the landing gear dug into the lakebed and broke.

""This day ushers in a new era of persistent Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) where an unmanned aircraft will remain on station for days at a time providing critical information and services,"" said Darryl Davis, president, Boeing Phantom Works. ""This flight puts Boeing on a path to accomplish another aerospace first – the capability of four days of unrefueled, autonomous flight.""

Phantom Eye is the latest in a series of Boeing-funded rapid prototyping programs, which include Phantom Ray, Echo Ranger, ScanEagle Compressed Carriage, and an associated Common Open Mission Management Command and Control (COMC2) system capable of managing all of the company's unmanned assets.

""While Phantom Eye is important for many reasons, future ISR, strike and bomber programs also will benefit from the technologies we are developing and maturing for our customers,"" said Davis.

The flight took place following a series of taxi tests in April that validated ground guidance, navigation and control, mission planning, pilot interface and operational procedures.

""This flight demonstrated Phantom Eye's initial handling and maneuverability capabilities,"" said Phantom Eye Program Manager Drew Mallow. ""The team is now analyzing data from the mission and preparing for our next flight. When we fly the demonstrator again, we will enter higher and more demanding envelopes of high-altitude flight.""

Phantom Eye's innovative and environmentally responsible liquid-hydrogen propulsion system will allow the aircraft to stay on station for up to four days while providing persistent monitoring over large areas at a ceiling of up to 65,000 feet, creating only water as a byproduct.

NoTTIP Day of Action on July 12. Rachel Megawhat / Demotix. All rights reserved.

The NHS has become a key battleground for the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP), the controversial treaty currently being negotiated in secret between the European Commission and the US government.

Now that more and more people are becoming aware of the threat that TTIP poses to public services, the European Commission and its friends have found a new and inventive way of trying to bamboozle people into accepting it.

On the eve of the sixth round of talks, which begin in Brussels this week, a 'private' letter from the EU's chief negotiator, Ignacio Garcia Bercero, to John Healey MP was conveniently leaked to the Guardian and Financial Times. The letter attempts to downplay the fact that public health services are included in TTIP, suggesting that there is no need to fear for the NHS as a result.

The media went further, suggesting that there was to be a 'carve out' for the NHS, or that US companies would not be allowed to run public health services in the future. Both claims are entirely false.

The first thing to note is that there is nothing new in the letter, nor any change in the EU's position. The European Commission has used exactly the same arguments to defend the inclusion of health, education and other public services in all previous trade agreements, as those of us who have been engaged in these debates for the past 20 years know all too well. Yet trade experts point out that public services are still highly vulnerable when they are included in negotiations, particularly when private operators have been granted access to public sector contracts, as is the case with the NHS.

The second thing to note is that the letter came from the chief EU negotiator to one of the principal cheerleaders for TTIP in Britain. John Healey chairs the all-party parliamentary group on EU-US investment, and has been doing his best to prevent trade unions and campaign groups from joining opposition to TTIP over the past few months. Happily, all major trade unions in Britain are now part of the campaign to stop TTIP. So here are some basic truths on the NHS and TTIP, starting with the most important and getting more technical as they go on:

1. Health services, medical services (including midwifery and physiotherapy) and dental services are all included in the TTIP negotiations. We already knew this because we saw it with our own eyes in the EU's draft offer to the USA that was uncovered last month. Indeed, Garcia Bercero's letter acknowledges that health services are on the table. The only sector that has been excluded from the TTIP talks is audio-visual services, as a result of dogged insistence by the French. All other public services are in, and can be traded away for further liberalisation if the US negotiators so demand.

If David Cameron wished to exclude the NHS or any other public service from the negotiations, he could do as the French government has done. All that is needed for this to happen, as the British Medical Association (BMA) has demanded, is for no mention of health services to appear in TTIP at all. In reality, of course, it is Cameron's government that has already opened up the NHS to private providers by means of the 2012 Health and Social Care Act. Why would he raise a finger to get it excluded from TTIP?

2. Garcia Bercero's letter also confirms another key charge from opponents of TTIP: that the NHS is open to attack under the new investor-state dispute settlement (ISDS) rules that TTIP would introduce between the EU and USA. For the first time, US corporations would be able to bypass our domestic courts and challenge our national health policy decisions before ad hoc arbitration tribunals, and to sue us for hundreds of millions of dollars in 'damages' as a result of future policy changes that might affect their bottom line. This is one clear mechanism that would prevent any future government from bringing the NHS back into public sector hands, as the cost of compensating private providers would render such a move instantly unattractive.

Garcia Bercero would like us to believe that future challenges to the NHS would be 'unlikely'. Yet the Slovak Republic has already lost a multi-million dollar case under similar rules to Dutch insurance company Achmea for reversing the country's earlier (and deeply unpopular) privatisation of health insurance. Tobacco giant Philip Morris is currently using ISDS provisions to sue the Australian government for billions of dollars over its new public health law that all cigarettes must be sold in plain paper packaging.

Overview Edit

Behind the big waterfall located at the Underground Reservoir, lies the entrance to this area. The trick to access it, is to equip Undine's soul (to be able to walk on the water's surface), and then equip and activate either the Curly's, Manticore's or Devil's soul to dash through the waterfall. Soma will receive the Eversing armor along the way and find the door leading to the Forbidden Area on the other side. Once inside, Soma may open the alternate path to the Study by going to the uppermost room, where he'll find a switch. Stepping on it will lower the gate that blocks the passage between the two places.

This area also has many treasure chests that give off considerable amounts of gold. Two items, the valuable Joyeuse and the Claimh Solais (the most useful weapon in the game) can also be found here. There's no boss in this area.

NBER Working Paper No. 21076

Issued in April 2015, Revised in July 2015

NBER Program(s):Corporate Finance, Economic Fluctuations and Growth, Labor Studies


We argue that firms' balance sheets were instrumental in the propagation of shocks during the Great Recession. Using establishment-level data, we show that firms that tightened their debt capacity in the run-up to the Great Recession (""highleverage firms"") exhibit a significantly larger decline in employment in response to household demand shocks than firms that freed up debt capacity (""low-leverage firms""). In fact, all of the job losses associated with falling house prices during the Great Recession are concentrated among establishments of high-leverage firms. At the county level, we show that counties with a larger fraction of establishments belonging to high-leverage firms exhibit a significantly larger decline in employment in response to household demand shocks. Thus, firms' balance sheets also matter for aggregate employment.

256666,False,1024,"Olympic great Michael Phelps acknowledged ""regrettable"" behavior and ""bad judgment"" after a photo in a British newspaper showed him inhaling from a marijuana pipe.

In a statement released Sunday, the swimmer who won a record eight gold medals at the Beijing Games did not dispute the authenticity of the exclusive picture published Saturday by the tabloid News of the World.

""I engaged in behavior which was regrettable and demonstrated bad judgment,"" Phelps said in the statement released by one of his agents. ""I'm 23 years old and despite the successes I've had in the pool, I acted in a youthful and inappropriate way, not in a manner people have come to expect from me. For this, I am sorry. I promise my fans and the public it will not happen again.""

News of the World said the picture was taken during a November house party while Phelps was visiting the University of South Carolina. During that trip, he attended one of the school's football games and received a big ovation when introduced to the crowd.

While the newspaper did not specifically allege that Phelps was smoking pot, it did say the pipe is generally used for that purpose and anonymously quoted a partygoer who said the Olympic champion was ""out of control from the moment he got there.""

The party occurred nearly three months after the Olympics while Phelps was taking a long break from training, and his actions should have no impact on the eight golds he won at Beijing. He has never tested positive for banned substances. The case is unlikely to fall under any doping rules.

Phelps' main sanctions most likely will be financial -- perhaps doled out by embarrassed sponsors who might be reconsidering their dealings with the swimmer.

Phelps was in Tampa, Fla., during Super Bowl week to make promotional appearances on behalf of a sponsor. But he left the city before Sunday's game between the Pittsburgh Steelers and Arizona Cardinals, abandoning his original plan to be at Raymond James Stadium.

The U.S. Olympic Committee said it was ""disappointed in the behavior recently exhibited by Michael Phelps,"" who was selected the group's sportsman of the year. He also was honored as AP male athlete of the year, and his feat in Beijing -- breaking Mark Spitz's 36-year-old record for most gold medals in an Olympics -- was chosen as the top story of 2008.

""Michael is a role model, and he is well aware of the responsibilities and accountability that come with setting a positive example for others, particularly young people,"" the USOC said in a statement. ""In this instance, regrettably, he failed to fulfill those responsibilities.""

USA Swimming said its Olympic champions are ""looked up to by people of all ages, especially young athletes who have their own aspirations and dreams.""

""That said,"" the governing body added, ""we realize that none among us is perfect. We hope that Michael can learn from this incident and move forward in a positive way.""

Phelps was part of a group of elite athletes who agreed to take part in a pilot testing program designed to increase the accuracy of doping tests. His spot in the program could be at risk, said Travis Tygart, head of the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency.

""For one of the Olympics' biggest heroes it's disappointing, and we'll evaluate whether he remains in that program,"" Tygart said. ""But some good education comes from this because he's going to suffer some penalties.""

Marijuana is viewed differently from performance-enhancing drugs, according to David Howman, executive director of the World Anti-Doping Agency. An athlete is subject to WADA sanctions only for a positive test that occurs during competition periods.

""We don't have any jurisdiction,"" Howman said. ""It's not banned out of competition. It's only if you test positive in competition.""

Phelps returned to the pool a couple of weeks ago to begin preparations for this summer's world championships in Rome. He plans to take part in his first post-Olympics meet in early March, a Grand Prix event in Austin, Texas.

This isn't the first embarrassing episode for Phelps after an Olympic triumph. In 2004, a few months removed from winning six gold and two bronze medals in Athens, the swimmer was arrested on a drunken driving charge at age 19. He pleaded guilty and apologized for the mistake.

In his book ""No Limits: The Will to Succeed,"" Phelps recounted how his first phone call was to his agent, and not his mother or coach Bob Bowman, because he knew they would yell at him.

Later, he called Bowman, who was supportive but told him, ""Michael, just because you want to blow off some steam doesn't mean you can be an idiot.""

Debbie Phelps, his mother, cried at the news of the drunken driving charge.

""That hurt worse, maybe, than anything,"" Phelps wrote",0.7121876307850894,0.8121876307850894,-0.1,0.0

The new revised edition of World Trek English Communication I , which is available for first-year students for the upcoming school year starting on April 1, features a reading section based on The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya .

The reading, titled ""Haruhi, an Amazing Girl,"" tells the story of how the paranormal-seeking Haruhi and sarcastic Kyon meet after entering high school. Nagaru Tanigawa and Noizi Ito 's original light novels and their television anime adaptation begin with the same story.

The reading is meant to take six hours of class time. For English-teaching purposes, the theme of the reading is school life. The unit that contains the reading is at the end of the textbook. Students should read it during their third semester at the end of the school year in February. Due to appearing in the end of the book, the reading is likely some of the highest-level content in this first-year English textbook. The book's other main reading is about Nobel Prize-winning Pakistani activist Malala Yousafzai.

Haruhi and friends already appeared in English vocabulary and grammar books published in Japan. Little, Brown Books for Young Readers began publishing the original light novels in English in 2009.

257480,False,1024,"I was googling around trying to remember the name of the funeral song for Pinochet and I found this video. The Chilean army uniforms got my attention. I could not recall anyone claiming that Pinochet was Hitler or even antisemitic. Out of curiosity I searched around for anything on his views regarding the Jews. I found this twenty year old article from the Jewish World Review. It turns out that the Jews thought The General was good for the Jews. This bit is what piqued my interest.

It is possible to say with a high degree of certainty that despite the prominent presence of Jews in Allende's government, an important number of Jews welcomed Pinochet. Moreover, when Allende was elected president in 1970, 8,000 of Chilean's 30,000 Jews fled the country, mostly to Israel, fearful of losing their property and assets to the socialist regime. Furthermore, when Pinochet took over three years later, many of those who had fled returned to Chile; however, other Jews fled the country.

The casual way in which a total lack of national loyalty is mentioned suggests it is just the way in which Jews view their relationship to the host country. Whether or not Allende was good or bad for Chile was inconsequential. What mattered was protecting their property and assets. There are other countries, after all. It is not the way most people would look at things. Your patriotic duty would require you to put nation ahead of personal gain, but more important, where would you go even if you threw in the towel on your country?

Jews have always been accused of having dual loyalties and the charge is not without some merit. It's also not without good cause. After all, if you are a tiny minority living in lands where the host population is often less than welcoming, a high degree of clannishness is a necessary tool for survival. That loyalty to the group over all else naturally means a lack of loyalty to the host population. Both Jews and gypsies have managed to thrive as tiny minority groups, largely because of intense group loyalty.

Of course, clannishness is a bit easier when the host population is hostile. In America, the host population has always been indifferent to Jews. The first wave that came over in the 19th century largely blended in with the locals. In areas where they maintained a unique cultural identity, German Jews tended to conduct themselves like the WASP elite. Steve Sailer has done a bunch of stuff on Jewish golf club culture and the divide between the first wave German Jews and the second wave eastern Jews.

If hostility from the majority helps minorities maintain group loyalty, then the lack of hostility works against it. In modern America, there's no such thing as Irish or Italian culture anymore. It has been commercialized and homogenized out of existence. It is why Jews work so hard to perpetuate the idea that they have faced terrible discrimination in America, despite all the evidence to the contrary. Maintaining the belief that the goyim are about to go full blown Nazi at any minute helps maintain group solidarity.

The thing is though, Jews are not a minority living on the fringes of American life. A scan of who controls the high ground in America shows that Jews are wildly over represented in the law, culture, media and finance. It really is quite incredible. Close to half of the owners of pro sports teams are Jewish. Roughly 85% of Jews attend college and 44% of Jewish households earn $100,000 or more. The statistics are rather incredible, when you consider that Jews are just 2% of the population.

American policy makers struggle to understand why Bashar al-Assad of Syria tenaciously hangs onto power. He has been offered a deal to leave Syria and live out his life in luxury somewhere in the West. Instead, he fights and his people fight, despite being outnumbered by the Sunnis. The Alawites are just 12% of the population, but they have been able to dominate Syria largely by remembering they used to be an oppressed minority. There was a time when Alawites had no legal rights. Righteous indignation is a powerful weapon.

This is relevant to Jews in America because they have manufactured a history of oppression in America as a way to maintain group loyalty and cohesion. This not only allows them to prosper, but it is a strong motivation to be wary of anything resembling group loyalty anywhere else. In a country that is becoming increasing fragmented, and headed for majority minority status, this will eventually be seen as hostility. Put another way, what has so far been good for the Jews could turn out to be really bad for the Jews.

Whether or not that's how things unfold is hard to know. The appearance of ""renegade Jews"", the term David Horowitz applied to Bill Kristol, could be a sign that Jewish identity and group loyalty is breaking apart.

255133,False,1024,"A federal appeals court on Friday blocked a North Carolina law that required voters to produce photo identification and follow other rules disproportionately affecting minorities, finding that the law was intended to make it harder for blacks to vote in the presidential battleground state.

The Virginia-based 4th Circuit Court of Appeals declared that the measures violated the Constitution and the federal Voting Rights Act by targeting black voters ""with almost surgical precision."" It marks the third ruling in less than two weeks against voter ID laws after court decisions regarding Texas and Wisconsin.

Friday's opinion from a three-judge panel states that ""the legislature enacted one of the largest restrictions of the franchise in modern North Carolina history"" when it rewrote voting laws in 2013.

The appeals court also dismissed arguments by Republican lawmakers that the law was aimed at preventing voter fraud.

""Although the new provisions target African Americans with almost surgical precision, they constitute inapt remedies for the problems assertedly justifying them and, in fact, impose cures for problems that did not exist,"" the opinion states.

Opponents of the law say the ruling should increase participation by black and Hispanic voters on Election Day in the state that also has closely contested races for U.S. Senate and governor. The U.S. Justice Department, state NAACP and League of Women Voters were among those who sued over the restrictions.

""This is a strong rebuke to what the North Carolina General Assembly did in 2013. It's a powerful precedent that ... federal courts will protect voting rights of voters of color,"" said Allison Riggs, who served as the League of Women Voters' lead lawyer.

The Rev. William Barber, president of the North Carolina NAACP, said the ruling was ""a vindication of our constitutional and moral critique and challenge to the constitutional extremism of our government.""

The decision was lauded by Democratic Party presidential nominee Hillary Clinton and Attorney General Loretta Lynch, but decried by Republicans including Gov. Pat McCrory as an effort to tilt the electoral balance in the November elections.

North Carolina legislative leaders Senate leader Phil Berger and House Speaker Tim Moore, both Republicans, issued a statement that they would appeal the ruling to the U.S. Supreme Court and blasted the judges as ""three partisan Democrats.""

""We can only wonder if the intent is to reopen the door for voter fraud, potentially allowing fellow Democrat politicians ... to steal the election,"" they said.

All three panel members were appointed by Democratic presidents.

However, it's unlikely that the evenly divided and short-handed Supreme Court would take the case or block Friday's ruling from governing elections this November, said election-law experts Ned Foley of Ohio State University and Richard Hasen of the University of California at Irvine.

Earlier this month, a federal appeals court ruled that Texas' strict voter ID law is discriminatory and must be weakened by November. That followed a ruling by a federal judge in Wisconsin that residents without a photo ID will still be allowed to vote.

Hasen said the Obama administration took on the North Carolina and Texas cases as a bulwark against voting restrictions.

""If North Carolina and Texas could get away with these voting restrictions, it would have been a green light for other states to do so,"" he said. ""I think this is a hugely important decision.""

North Carolina's voting laws were rewritten in 2013 by the General Assembly two years after Republicans took control of both legislative chambers for the first time in a century. It was also shortly after a U.S. Supreme Court ruling changed the requirement that many Southern states receive federal approval before changing voting laws.

The voter ID mandate, which took effect in March, required people casting ballots in person to show one of six qualifying IDs, although voters facing ""reasonable impediments"" could fill out a form and cast a provisional ballot.

North Carolina legislators imposed the photo ID requirement, curtailed early voting and eliminated same-day registration and voters' ability to cast out-of-precinct provisional ballots in their home counties.

The appeals court cited data that these methods were used disproportionately by black voters, who also were more likely to lack a qualifying ID, and it blocked the contested provisions of the law.

The judges wrote that in the years before the North Carolina law took effect, registration and participation by black voters had been dramatically increasing.

""We recognize that elections have consequences, but winning an election does not empower anyone in any party to engage in purposeful racial discrimination,"" the panel said.

The Rev. Moses Colbert, a 61-year-old pastor at a church in Gastonia, said the elimination of same-day registration ensured that he couldn't vote on Election Day 2014 shortly after moving within North Carolina. He'd sought to change his voter registration at the Department of Motor Vehicles, but the update didn't get to county officials by the election.

258821,True,394,"WASHINGTON — As Democrats on Capitol Hill staged a sit-in in the House chamber seeking a vote on gun policy measures, the ACLU sent a letter to senators opposing the latest compromise measure being considered.

The measure — proposed by Republican Sen. Susan Collins and backed by the Democrats' leader in that chamber, Sen. Harry Reid — is a more narrow version of the ""terrorism watchlist"" gun ban measure proposed by Sen. Dianne Feinstein that was rejected earlier in the week.

Collins' measure utilizes the No-Fly List and the Selectee List as the basis for restricting gun purchases — which would include a far narrower group of individuals than the broad terrorism watchlist used in Feinstein's original proposal — but that change was not enough to lead the ACLU to support the measure.

""The ACLU strongly urges you to vote against the Collins Amendment because it uses the error-prone and unfair watchlist system, along with vague and overbroad terms, as a predicate for a proceeding to deny a firearms permit,"" the ACLU officials wrote in the letter. ""The Collins Amendment relies on both the No Fly List, by codifying its criteria, and the Selectee List, by direct reference.""

The ACLU letter goes on to detail concerns with the due process protections in the amendment, stating that the amendment would provide even fewer protections than the amendment proposed by Sen. John Cornyn earlier this week — which the ACLU also opposed.

Finally, the organization warns that the Collins amendment ""would impose a notification requirement that could result in a new 'watchlist' broader than any that currently exists."" This is so, the ACLU argues, because the amendment would require officials ""to be informed of each application for a firearm by any person who has been on the master watchlist at any point over the past five years—even if the person has been cleared of any wrongdoing, the investigation was otherwise closed, or the person was long ago removed from the list.""",0.8078346001701197,0.8078346001701197,0.0,0.0

259904,False,1024,"PALISADE — More than 300 local job-seekers have trooped into Talbott Farms' office this year to inquire about jobs in the orchards and vineyards.

Still, out in the fields, most of the workers doing the early thinning and spraying have come here on temporary guest-worker visas from Mexico.

It is not that Talbott and other growers don't want to hire fellow Americans hurting from extended unemployment. But many of those job-seekers aren't willing to tackle the tough, low- wage, long-hour farm labor.

""They miss a lot of work. They come when they want to come. They get bored,"" said Mario Moreno, a crew leader for Talbott.

The voluminous regulations attached to bringing in H-2A guest agricultural workers require that employers exhaust all attempts to hire Americans before giving jobs to foreign workers.

Employers say the H-2A workers are willing to work the long hours and, as their visas require, will stick with the job until after the harvest. Those workers also don't want to jeopardize pay that at the end of one day in the orchards adds up to a week's pay in Mexico.

Many have agriculture experience. And many return to the same U.S. farms year after year, which means they can do the work without much oversight.

""I'm doing my level best to support the local economy, but it's tough,"" said Theresa High, who operates High Country Orchards, down the road from Talbott.

High Country has had similar trouble with local workers leaving jobs once they realize picking fruit for long hours is not the fun they had envisioned.

During boom times, locals often don't bother to look to the orchards and farm fields for jobs. But when construction and energy-drilling jobs went away, the unemployed began to consider unskilled farm work that generally pays about $8 an hour.

Bill Thoennes, a spokesman for the Colorado Department of Labor and Employment, said employers must walk a fine line when they spell out the difficulties of the work without seeming to intimate that they don't want to hire local workers.

John Harold of Tuxedo Corn in Olathe said he gets few local applicants because word has gotten around that his work days begin at 6 a.m.

""It's amazing how few have applied this year,"" he said.

""A big challenge""

At Talbott, the largest fruit operation in the Grand Valley, hundreds of job-seekers asked about employment this year and last. This spring, only 15 of the workers sent out by the Mesa County Workforce Center submitted applications.

Nine showed up for work. Four of those were gone after a week. One remains on the crew, and he is missing work this day because he was arrested on suspicion of drunken driving the previous night.

""It's a big challenge. Almost all of them have a background that makes them difficult to employ,"" said Bruce Talbott as he pulled out a slip of paper where he had tallied the hours put in by domestic hires compared with the H-2A workers.

The locals worked 37 to 55 hours a week while the H-2A workers were in the orchards for about 70 hours.

Talbott said some of the locals are hard workers, ""but they have never seen a fruit tree before.""

He said because he has seen desperation in their eyes this year, he tries to hire them despite the challenges. In doing so, he runs the risk of not having enough workers at harvest time. If his American workers quit, it will be too late to apply for more H-2A workers.

A requirement that employers anticipate the shortage of local workers and apply for H-2A workers at least 45 days before the workers are needed is just one of the complications of the guest-worker program.

The jobs must be advertised in newspapers and on radio stations and posted at job service centers. Employers must hire local workers if they are ""able, willing, qualified and available.""

Decline in requests

Voluminous record-keeping is required for every step.

The H-2A rules changed in mid- March under the Obama administration to raise wages and call for mandatory inspections of housing. Farmworker rights groups are applauding the changes as being more protective of workers. For many growers, the regulations are more costly and cumbersome.

The combination of more available domestic workers and H-2A rules has resulted in a decline in requests for the workers in Colorado.

In 2008, Colorado growers put in 153 applications for nearly 2,000 guest workers. This year, 96 growers have asked for 1,036 guest workers.

Still, Moreno said, the guest workers do the bulk of the jobs in the orchards.

One thing was evident during a May tour the representatives of the Oregon Cattlemen's Association took of the Prairie and Little Sheep Creek watershed in Enterprise with water quality program officials from the Oregon Department of Agriculture and the Oregon Department of Environmental Quality.

What was so clear was that a vast amount of conservation work has been done by landowners. Even more impressive is that the Wallowa Soil and Water Conservation District (SWCD) officials found promising results of improved water quality through their monitoring program.

Bill Moore, the OCA's past president, showed examples of how riparian areas have responded to grazing and total exclusion, along with the fact that weeds were a reoccurring problem in the non-grazed areas. Moore also showed significant challenges in addressing legacy issues, such as channelization projects funded by government programs more than 20 years ago, which are now believed to adversely affect water quality.

On the tour, Cynthia Warnock, of the Wallowa SWCD, described extensive efforts to establish trees and willows on several sites along the riparian areas, saying that less than one percent of the plantings had been successful. Kyle Bratcher, an Oregon Department of Fish & Wildlife official, said there have been more favorable results in establishing woody vegetation with a new technique being implemented by placing wire panels around naturally establishing seedlings to protect them from wildlife, rather than completely fencing off a riparian area.

A local rancher pointed to one part of their riparian area excluded from grazing and explained how weeds, deer, elk and rodents have been a challenging factors in their conservation efforts. This was a unique opportunity to see and discuss side by side comparisons of grazed and non-grazed riparian areas, along with restoration efforts compared with actual conditions achieved.

OCA Water Resources Chair, Curtis Martin, said, ""It was particularly encouraging to hear that the agencies intend to take a wide range of site specific factors, historical information, along with input from area stakeholders when updating local Ag Water Quality Plans and Rules. When it comes to setting TMDLs for non-point sources, it is important decisions are being based on measurable results of improve water quality and appropriate monitoring is implemented.""

The conclusion of the tour was just a few short miles away, where the group viewed the aftermath of a public land fire in the upland which has had a considerable impact on water quality throughout the entire watershed for decades. Those on the tour said the final stop on the tour drove home how significant factors outside the control of individual landowners can have on water quality throughout the entire watershed.",0.6591379154738972,0.7591379154738972,-0.1,0.0

The Wivells' dispute with the association ultimately boils down to whether the display is considered a sign or a decoration.

Wivell says it is a decoration. The homemade display consists of a piece of plywood painted white and inscribed with the name ""Jesus"" in red, tinsel garland. He put it in his front yard at the same time as his Mickey and Minnie Mouse Christmas decorations and even draped a strand of lights over top of the wood. A small nativity scene sits beneath it.

258806,False,1024,"Various ancient maps discovered throughout time reveal a slightly different reality than what we've been accustomed to, with the most astounding find being the continent of Antarctica, mapped by the ancients at a time when this southernmost landmass was free of ice.

Since birth, people are hard-wired to adhere to a dogmatic reality with a narrow view of the world. As time passes, evidence contradicting this paradigm is brought to our attention, and so we rapidly adjust our way of thinking to a bigger picture that doesn't appear to be framed, nor acknowledged by modern understanding.

One of the most substantial examples is that of ancient sailors who were apparently able to traverse the planet from one pole to another. These people had advanced knowledge in many fields, and were able to produce precise charts of the world using an instrument of navigation for accurately determining longitudes that was beyond anything possessed by either of the ancient, medieval, or modern people up until the 18th century.

Because of this evidence that cannot be in any way hindered or disproved, we can assume that a long-forgotten civilization thrived on this earth in remote times. Evidence is mounting in this direction, and those who reject this hypothesis as mere myth will soon have to rethink and redesign the entire concept of human history.

Among the many paradigm contradicting pieces is the Oronteus Finaeus map. Published in 1531, it displays Antarctica free of ice, together with accurate depictions of rivers, valleys, coastlines, and the approximate location of the south pole. It also gives the appropriate longitudinal coordinates. Keep in mind that Antarctica was barely discovered (at least by modern standards) in 1773, after Captain James Cook and his crew reached the islands of the Antarctic Circle, but none set foot on the actual landmass until the Norwegian expedition in 1911.

This could mean two things. Either the presented map is an elaborate forgery, and as you're about to see this comes out of the question, or human beings are once again rediscovering a land and knowledge that was once lost to the infamy of time. This, in turn, adds to a greater pile of 'controversial' evidence that hints at the very same thing – the existence of an advanced civilization before or during the last ice age.

The highlighted world-map was drawn by Oronteus Finaeus in 1531. It compiled various source maps that made it out of the great library of Alexandria during the ruthless siege of Egypt. Those sources originated from a peoples unknown that allegedly passed down the information from one generation to another. Egyptian cartographers who studied that information made various charts that were transferred to Constantinopole and other cultural centers after the siege of Alexandria.

The maps were stored there until 1204 when, during the Fourth Crusade, Venetians besieged Constantinopole and numerous valuable resources fell into their hands. Since then, the charts made it into circulation because they showed never before reached areas such as the Americas, Arctic and Antarctic seas.

Charles Hapgood, an esteemed American writer and professor, came across the intriguing chart during his early studies in the 90s. After devoting a great deal of time analyzing it, he reached the aforementioned conclusions. Although the scientific community couldn't agree with his paradigm-shattering finds, he carried on with his investigation that eventually yielded the expected results. Here is an excerpt from his work on the Oronteus Finaeus map.

The general shape of the continent was startlingly like the outline of the continent on our modern map. The position of the South Pole, nearly in the center of the continent, seemed about right. The mountain ranges that skirted the coasts suggested the numerous ranges that have been discovered in Antarctica in recent years. It was obvious, too, that this was no slapdash creation of somebody's imagination. The mountain ranges were individualized, some definitely coastal and some not. From most of them rivers were shown flowing into the sea, following in every case what looked like very very natural and very convincing drainage patterns. This suggested, of course, that the coasts may have been ice-free when the original map was drawn.""

In 1960, Professor Hapgood delivered his findings to the US Air Force which performed a thorough analysis of both the Oronteus Finaeus map and the Piri Rei's map of the Turkish Admiral.

In 1961, he received a response that would please him and further confirm his beliefs, although the rooted conceptions of the scientific community remained unchanged.

Nevertheless, the idea of a timeworn and 'modern' civilization that existed before our current timeline transformed into a solid pillar, hard, if not impossible to crack.

The below transcript received by Professor Hapgood from the US Air Force investigation team represents the culminating point of this investigation due to its official nature.

The New York Times writes that the crowds and unexpectedly strong showing garnered by the Vermont senator are setting off worry among Clinton advisers and allies, who believe Sanders could actually overtake her in Iowa polls by the fall. They even believe he could defeat her in the nation's first nominating contest there. The enthusiasm Sanders has generated has called into question Clinton's early strategy of focusing on a listening tour of small groups and wooing big donors in private settings, the Times writes. ""We are worried about him, sure. He will be a serious force for the campaign, and I don't think that will diminish,"" said Jennifer Palmieri, the Clinton campaign's communications director, on MSNBC's ""Morning Joe"" on Monday.

Carson's cash: Before Republican presidential hopeful Ben Carson was vying for votes from members of Christian organizations, he was charging them tens of thousands of dollars for speeches. As Politico writes, Carson brought in nearly $2 million delivering inspirational speeches to faith-based groups including Christian high schools and pregnancy centers in 2014. A Politico analysis of his financial disclosure form showed that four of his five most lucrative speeches were at such Christian venues. His speaking fees varied widely, from $12,320 to $48,500, according to the disclosures.

The next liberal cause: The Washington Post's Greg Sargent writes that Senate Democrats will soon roll out a new universal pre-kindergarten proposal. If it gets a vote, he says, it will put members of both parties on the record as to whether they support national action to dramatically expand the availability of child care to poor and working families. The proposal could be paid for by reining in corporate tax breaks, according to the Democrats. Specifically, the program would be funded by scaling back corporate ""inversions,"" in which companies declare their U.S. operations are owned by a subsidiary abroad.

The Post, in fact, says Trump's company may be relying on some undocumented workers to finish the $200 million hotel, which will sit five blocks from the White House.

258928,False,1024,"When Crystal Bullard moved to Memphis from the Bahamas last year, she was looking for a new life and a better education for her three young children.

What she found was an overwhelming school system that was hard to navigate, and an environment where her children felt like outsiders.

Her children, ages 4, 7 and 9, were initially bullied at Whitney Achievement Elementary School, the North Memphis school she chose because it was closest to her home. The bullying meant her kids didn't want to go to school. For Bullard, missing a day or two was a common problem at the beginning of last school year.

""When I came here, I didn't know nothing. I had nothing,"" Bullard said. ""I came to this school because it was the first I found. But it was so hard to get the kids up and here every day. We struggled with that for many weeks.""

Bullard is not alone in her daily battle to get the kids to school. Almost a fifth of Memphis students are considered chronically absent, which means they missed at least 18 days during the school year. Research has shown chronic absenteeism is linked to negative outcomes for students, including lower test scores, higher dropout rates, and even a greater risk of entering the criminal justice system.

Absenteeism has such a large impact on learning, districts are under pressure from new national legislation to include chronic absenteeism data in how they evaluate schools.

In Memphis, a local nonprofit is working to improve attendance numbers. Agape Child & Family Services places its employees in schools throughout Memphis to help with attendance, behavior, and academic issues.

Rise & Shine Tennessee Start your morning with the latest Tennessee education news in your inbox. Subscribe ""Chalkbeat grounds me in the work going on here. It's a lifesaver for understanding the lay of the education land."" — Clare L.

Bullard said her life began to change when her family joined the Agape program. The three full-time Agape workers at Whitney walked Bullard through why it was crucial for her kids to come to school every day. They provided her with school supplies and uniforms, and tutored her children. Agape also provided counseling for Bullard and her children through another part of its organization.

""My kids have too many friends now,"" Bullard said. ""They aren't afraid, they're excited to come to school. My kids are 100 percent better now than when we came. We still have issues to work out, but we feel welcome.""

For schools like Whitney Elementary, days of missed instruction can quickly put students behind academically. Whitney was taken over in 2012 by the state's Achievement School District, which is trying to turn around Tennessee's worst-performing schools. Every day of instruction matters in their efforts to boost student achievement, Whitney principal LaSandra Young said.

""Our attendance is low at the start of the year because students have transferred or moved,"" said Young. The school currently enrolls 263 kids — Agape helps the school track students down.

""Sometimes it's as simple as they don't have school supplies yet or are struggling with transportation,"" Young said. ""The extra support they provide is crucial because every day of attendance really does matter.""

Charity Ellis, one of Agape's staff members at Whitney, said her job can look very different day-to-day, but working closely with students is consistent. Some days Agape pulls students out of class to work intensely on reading or math skills. Or if students are struggling with behavior in class, Agape staff members will pull the students into the hallway to speak with them and calm them down.

Agape staff also try to stay in constant communication with parents, especially if their kids are missing school, Ellis said.

If parents are running late, they might decide to keep their student at home rather than bring them for a half day, Ellis said. ""But when we communicate with them how important every hour of learning is, they get that. Sometimes all it takes is one conversation and how deeply we care about their kids.""

Agape worked with 82 kids at Whitney Elementary last year, who were chosen by the school, including Bullard's three children. About 90 percent of those students are now attending at least 90 percent of the school year, said David Jordan, CEO of Agape.

The program has grown every year from when it began in 2013 with 113 students. Now, more than 550 students are a part of Agape programs in 16 schools throughout the Frayser, Raleigh, Hickory Hill, and Whitehaven neighborhoods — and they are all now at school for at least 85 percent of the school year. This is just shy of their goal for Agape students to attend more than 90 percent of the year.

For comparison, 57 percent of all students in Shelby County Schools and the Achievement School District attend school for more than 90 percent",0.5874145712893148,0.7874145712893148,-0.2,0.0

258259,True,726,"In a disturbing incident in Tennessee, a 22-year-old married man allegedly posed as a senior transfer student at one of Memphis' best boys basketball teams, leading to the squad's elimination from the state playoffs.

22-year-old McKinzie Sewell competing in high school basketball at Ridgeway High — BeRecruited More

As reported by Memphis CBS affiliate WREG and the Memphis Commercial Appeal, McKinzie Sewell used a fake transcript to enroll at Memphis (Tn.) Ridgeway High, where he starred on the boys basketball team. Sewell's transcript was allegedly submitted to the school by his wife, who posed as his mother so he would have a back story to explain why he was enrolling at the school.

Sewell never previously graduated from a high school, but he earned a GED. Somewhat ironically, he wore the number 22 for Ridgeway, identical to his age. He also set up a BeRecruited profile under his name portraying himself as an 18-year-old senior at Ridgeway.

It has not been confirmed whether Sewell registered with the school for the fall or winter term. Regardless, the fact that he had taken the court at all immediately made the entire Ridgeway squad ineligible for the state playoffs, just after the school had reached the regional final round of the tournament.

""It has come to our attention that an ineligible player played in the closing minutes of the Region 8-AAA semi-finals against Whitehaven High School,"" Memphis Community Schools said in a statement. ""Ridgeway High School reported this information to the Tennessee Secondary School Athletic Association [TSSAA]. Ridgeway HS has forfeited that game and has been removed from the tournament playoffs.""

[More from Prep Rally: No exaggeration: The craziest buzzer-beater you've ever seen]

That removal has effectively ended the season for a group of players who had overcome significant hardship to reach the state semis. Most notably, one of the team's assistant coaches was killed in his home in February.

Now the team will have to stay home, with parents of the players furious at the Memphis Community Schools' inability to catch Sewell before he had suited up for a game.

""It's absurd the administration has failed,"" Adrian Jones, a Ridgeway parent told WREG. ""They're not keeping the kids safe. They're not doing checks and balances.""

Sewell is not the first imposter to strike the prep hoops ranks. In 2010 a Haitian 22-year-old named Guerdwich Montimere played the high school basketball season at Odessa (Tx.) Permian High. He was eventually caught and sentenced to three years in prison because of a relationship with a teenager while he was at the school.

Now Sewell joins the ranks of Montimere and others in the ranks of disturbing prep imposters who have threatened the safety of the teens they compete with and against.

256565,True,845,"Scientists used supercomputers to find a new class of materials that possess an exotic state of matter known as the quantum spin Hall effect. The researchers published their results in the journal Science in December 2014, where they propose a new type of transistor made from these materials.

The computational allocation was made through XSEDE, the Extreme Science and Engineering Discovery Environment, a single virtual system funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF) that scientists use to interactively share computing resources, data and expertise. The study was funded by the U.S. Department of Energy and the NSF.

""To me, national computing resources like XSEDE, or specifically the Stampede and Lonestar supercomputers, are extremely helpful to computational scientists,"" Xiaofeng Qian said. In January 2015, Qian left MIT to join Texas A&M University as the first tenure-track assistant professor at its newly formed Department of Materials Science and Engineering.

""To me, national computing resources like XSEDE, or specifically the Stampede and Lonestar supercomputers, are extremely helpful to computational scientists."" Xiaofeng Qian, Assistant Professor in the Department of Materials Science and Engineering at Texas A&M University.

What Qian and colleagues did was purely theoretical work, using Stampede for part of the calculations that modeled the interactions of atoms in the novel materials, two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDC). Qian used the molecular dynamics simulation software Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package to model a unit cell of atoms, the basic building block of the crystal lattice of TMDC.

Scientists diagram the electronic band structure of materials to show the energy ranges an electron is allowed, with the band gap showing forbidden zones that basically block the flow of current. Spin-orbit coupling accounts for the electromagnetic interactions between electron's spin and magnetic field generated from the electron's motion around the nucleus.

""We found a very convenient method to control the topological phase transition in these quantum spin Hall interlayers."" Xiaofeng Qian, Assistant Professor in the Department of Materials Science and Engineering at Texas A&M University.

The complexity lies in the details of these interactions, for which Qian applied many-body perturbation theory with the GW approximation, a state-of-the-art first principles method, to calculate the quasiparticle electronic structures for electrons and holes. The 'G' is short for Green's Function and 'W' for screened Coulomb interaction, Qian explained.

The big picture for Qian and his colleagues is the hunt for new kinds of materials with extraordinarily useful properties. Their target is room-temperature quantum spin Hall insulators, which are basically near-two-dimensional materials that block current flow everywhere except along their edges. ""Along the edges you have the so-called spin up electron flow in one direction, and at the same time you have spin down electrons and flows away in the opposite direction,"" Qian explained. ""Basically, you can imagine, by controlling the injection of charge carriers, one can come up with spintronics, or electronics.""

The scientists in this work proposed a topological field-effect transistor, made of sheets of hexagonal boron interlaced with sheets of TMDC. ""We found a very convenient method to control the topological phase transition in these quantum spin Hall interlayers,"" Qian said. ""This is very important because once we have this capability to control the phase transition, we can design some electronic devices that can be controlled easily through electrical fields.""

Qian stressed that this work lays the theoretical ground for future real experiments in the lab. He hopes it might develop into an actual transistor suitable for a quantum computer, basically an as-yet-unrealized machine that manipulates data beyond just the binary of ones and zeros.

""So far, we haven't looked into the detailed applications for quantum computing yet,"" Qian said. ""However, it is possible to combine these materials with superconductors and come up with the so-called Majorana fermion zero mode for quantum computing.""",0.0,0.8186310561158341,-1.3,0.0

The elderly victim of a burglary in Cardiff has written an open letter to the person responsible as part of an appeal for information.

Iris Mayer returned home from a hospital appointment to her house in Fairwater on Friday, January 17, to discover that her front door was locked from the inside.

Once inside, the 79-year-old discovered that her home had been ransacked by burglars who stole money, jewellery, a purse and a phone.

Even worse, the burglary happened as the pensioner prepared for the funeral of her grandson the following day.

A police investigation is continuing and detectives believe the culprit is local to the area.

Now in an appeal for information, Mrs Mayer has released a photograph of the mess and written a letter to the person responsible in the hope it will encourage them or those with information to come forward.

In it the angry pensioner said: ""Pity you didn't wait one more day, you would have had the house to yourself. And maybe left it as you found it, clean and tidy, not like a tip.

""You obviously went with your muddy boots straight to the bedrooms where you left muddy prints all over my cream carpets, even the goods you threw on the floor, you walked over without any concern.

""I do hope you made a mistake and are caught. If it is stealing to pay for drugs you need help before it kills you, I would like to suggest you are made to go cold turkey and clean up your way of life.""

Officers believe the person or person's responsible gained access to the back of the house via a footpath which runs between Keystone road and Tangmere Drive.

Once inside the property they changed a bedroom light bulb which detectives believe was to enable them to see better.

It is believed the house was burgled some time between 1pm and 3.30pm.

Detective Constable Geraint Higgins said: ""This elderly victim has been left devastated by what has happened.

""Whoever was responsible mercilessly ransacked her home to look for something to steal. The victim has shown tremendous bravery and we are appealing for information that will help us make an arrest.

""People may have been offered a mobile phone, or they may have seen or found a purse discarded in the area.

Oct. 5, 2015 (Mimesis Law) — The jury returned its verdict and the judge, as judges pretty much all do, thanked them for their service. It is, he said, a difficult thing the county asked you to do, and it is grateful. Then he –

Oh, wait, sorry. I left out the crime. It was ugly. Edgar Allen Poe stuff. Hoffner and his co-defendant Archie Dixon wanted to get hold of their buddy Chris Hammer's car. So they, with the assistance of Kristen Wilkerson (Dixon's girlfriend) . . . Feh. Don't make me tell it. Here's the official version, from the Ohio Supreme Court's opinion in Hoffner's appeal.

In the early morning of September 22, Hoffner, Dixon, and Hammer went to Wilkerson's house. Once there, Hoffner and Dixon attacked Hammer. Hoffner restrained Hammer in a headlock while Dixon beat him. Hoffner tried to break Hammer's neck, and Dixon struck Hammer in the head with a wine bottle. Hoffner and Dixon then tied Hammer to a bunk-bed ladder, and Dixon went through Hammer's wallet, taking out his money, birth certificate, and Social Security card. Then Hoffner and Dixon discussed how they should dispose of Hammer's body. While Hammer remained tied to the bunk-bed ladder, Hoffner and Dixon left Wilkerson's house to dig a grave. Hoffner and Dixon returned to Wilkerson's house and they, along with Wilkerson, drove Hammer, blindfolded, to the gravesite in Hammer's car. Wilkerson stayed at the car while Hoffner and Dixon walked Hammer into the woods, where they permitted Hammer to smoke a cigarette. Then they gagged and again blindfolded Hammer, tied his hands and feet behind his back, grabbed him by his arms and legs, and dropped him into the grave, still alive. At one point, Hammer was able to remove the gag from his mouth and free one of his legs. Hoffner jumped into the grave and placed his foot over Hammer's mouth when Hammer yelled for help. Hoffner and Dixon then held Hammer down and covered him with dirt. After Hammer was completely buried, Hoffner and Dixon walked back and forth across the grave, packing down the dirt. Hoffner, Dixon, and Wilkerson then returned to Wilkerson's house in Hammer's car.

OK, got that? Now, let's start again.

The jury returned its verdict recommending that Tim Hoffner be executed, that he should be killed in the name of the people of the State of Ohio. And the judge, as judges pretty much all do after any jury trial, thanked them for their service. It is, he said, a difficult thing the county asked you to do, but a vitally important thing.

Then he added that if any of the jurors needed therapy as a result of performing this service, the county would pay for it.

There were three executions scheduled for last week.

Kelly Gissendaner, on death row in Georgia, didn't kill anyone herself though she arranged for the 1997 murder of her husband, Douglas Gissander. Gregory Owen, the actual killer, was her lover at the time. He's doing life with a chance of parole. Whatever, whoever Gissendaner was then, she'd changed, showed remorse, provided support and counsel for other prisoners.

Richard Glossip, on death row in Oklahoma, didn't kill anyone, either. It was Justin Sneed, serving a life sentence for the crime, who murdered Barry Van Treese, the owner of the motel where they both worked. The state's theory is that Glossip put Sneed up to it. The evidence supporting that claim, never strong, has pretty much completely unraveled.

It's pretty clear that Alfredo Prieto, on death row in Virginia, did kill people himself, at least three and maybe half a dozen more that he's been linked to. He was on death row in California for the 1990 rape and murder of Yvette Woodruff when DNA tied him to killings in Virginia. He was extradited there, tried and again sentenced to be killed for the 1988 murders of Rachel Raver and Warren Fulton, III.[1] There's a fair chance that Prieto was mentally retarded. If so, his execution would be unconstitutional. The courts showed no interest in finding out.

Gissendaner was to be executed Tuesday, Glossip Wednesday, Prieto Thursday. In each case the Pope, who'd made a point of calling for abolition of the death penalty when he spoke to Congress, made a specific request that the sentence be commuted. None of the sentences were.

In each case, last minute litigation raised questions about what would happen. None of it staved off the executions. Lit",0.0,0.7749452142150335,-0.8,-0.1
259575,True,780,"A:

When financing a company, ""cost"" is the measurable cost of obtaining capital. With debt, this is the interest expense a company pays on its debt. With equity, the cost of capital refers to the claim on earnings provided to shareholders for their ownership stake in the business.

What Is Debt Financing?

When a firm raises money for capital by selling debt instruments to investors, it is known as debt financing. In return for lending the money, the individuals or institutions become creditors and receive a promise that the principal and interest on the debt will be repaid on a regular schedule.

What Is Equity Financing?

Equity financing is the process of raising capital through the sale of shares in a company. With equity financing comes an ownership interest for shareholders. Equity financing may range from a few thousand dollars raised by an entrepreneur from a private investor to an initial public offering (IPO) on a stock exchange running into the billions.

Lower Cost of Financing: Debt Versus Equity

Provided a company is expected to perform well, debt financing can usually be obtained at a lower effective cost.

For example, if you run a small business and need $40,000 of financing, you can either take out a $40,000 bank loan at a 10 percent interest rate or you can sell a 25 percent stake in your business to your neighbor for $40,000.

Suppose your business earns a $20,000 profit during the next year. If you took the bank loan, your interest expense (cost of debt financing) would be $4,000, leaving you with $16,000 in profit.

Conversely, had you used equity financing, you would have zero debt (and as a result, no interest expense), but would keep only 75 percent of your profit (the other 25 percent being owned by your neighbor). Therefor, your personal profit would only be $15,000, or (75% x $20,000).

From this example, you can see how it is less expensive for you, as the original shareholder of your company, to issue debt as opposed to equity. Taxes make the situation even better if you had debt, since interest expense is deducted from earnings before income taxes are levied, thus acting as a tax shield (although we have ignored taxes in this example for the sake of simplicity).

Of course, the advantage of the fixed-interest nature of debt can also be a disadvantage. It presents a fixed expense, thus increasing a company's risk. Going back to our example, suppose your company only earned $5,000 during the next year. With debt financing, you would still have the same $4,000 of interest to pay, so you would be left with only $1,000 of profit ($5,000 - $4,000). With equity, you again have no interest expense, but only keep 75 percent of your profits, thus leaving you with $3,750 of profits (75% x $5,000).

However, if a company fails to generate enough cash, the fixed-cost nature of debt can prove too burdensome. This basic idea represents the risk associated with debt financing.

The Bottom Line

Companies are never totally certain what their earnings will amount to in the future (although they can make reasonable estimates). The more uncertain their future earnings, the more risk is presented. As a result, companies in very stable industries with consistent cash flows generally make heavier use of debt than companies in risky industries or companies who are very small and just beginning operations. New businesses with high uncertainty may have a difficult time obtaining debt financing, and often finance their operations largely through equity.

259112,True,573,"ORLANDO (CBSNewYork) — The alleged male lover of Orlando nightclub gunman Omar Mateen claims he did the shooting as ""revenge"" against Latino men.

The man, who spoke to Univision on the condition of anonymity, said Mateen held a grudge against Latino men he met at the gay nightclub Pulse because he felt used by them.

""I've cried like you have no idea. But the thing that makes me want to tell the truth is that he didn't do it for terrorism. In my opinion he did it for revenge,"" the man who said he was Mateen's lover for two months told Univision.

The man told Univision that the FBI has interviewed him three times about Mateen. Univision reported that FBI said they have met with the man.

""He adored Latinos, gay Latinos, with brown skin, but he felt rejected. He felt used by them,"" the man said. ""There were moments in the Pulse nightclub that made him feel really bad. Guys used him. That really affected him.""

The man claimed that Mateen was upset after having a sexual encounter with two Puerto Rican men after one of them revealed he was HIV positive.

""He was terrified that he was infected,"" the man told Univision. ""I asked him, 'Did you do a test?' Yes. He went to the pharmacy and did the test … it came out negative, but it doesn't come out right away. It takes four, five months.

""When I asked him what he was going to do now, his answer was, 'I'm going to make them pay for what they did to me.'""

CBS News and the Los Angeles Times previously reported that Mateen used gay dating apps. He also frequented the Pulse nightclub before killing 49 people more than one week ago.

The man claims he and Mateen met around 20 times, with the last meeting taking place in December. He said Mateen never revealed his name to him, but told him that he was 35 and married with a son. He told Univision that he believed Mateen's wife knew that he went to gay bars and that his marriage was to hide the fact that he was ""100 percent"" gay.

CBS News reported that on the night of the shooting Mateen went into the club and received a wristband and left. He then returned nearly two hours later to begin his attack.

Mateen pledged allegiance to the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria during the attack on Facebook and 911 calls.

""The aim of the political settlement is to create a state based on the principle of citizenship without Bashar al-Assad or figures of his regime having a place in it or any future political arrangements,"" the group of rebel factions said in a statement issued at the end of two-day talks held in Saudi Arabia's capital city, Riyadh.

""Participants have insisted that Bashar al-Assad and his aides quit power with the start of the transition period,"" the statement added.

Hosted by the Saudi Arabia, the unprecedented talks between more than 100 representatives from armed and political opposition groups tried to unite the factions fighting against the Syrian government in the bloody conflict in which more than 250,000 people have been killed.

OPINION: Who represents the Syrian people?

Monzer Akbik, a member of the National Coalition opposition bloc, said the meeting agreed to set up a 25-strong leadership group, including six coalition members, six from rebel factions, five from the NCB and eight independent figures.

""These are representatives of all the opposition factions, political and military, and they are going to be the decision makers in terms of the political settlement,"" said Akbik.

He was speaking from the United Arab Emirates after being briefed on Thursday morning's talks. A separate negotiating team of 15 members would also be appointed, he told Reuters.

The groups said they are prepared to meet the government in the first 10 days of January.

'Progress'

US Secretary of State John Kerry, speaking in Paris, said the Riyadh talks had made progress ""but we have some tough issues to get over.""

A possible December 18 meeting to advance the Syrian peace talks in New York is ""not locked in yet"", Kerry added.

Major powers agreed in Vienna last month to revive diplomatic efforts to end the war, calling for peace talks to start by January and elections within two years.

Saudi Arabia is a main backer of the rebels along with Turkey and Western countries. Iran and Russia support Assad, and say it is up to the Syrian people to decide when the leader should leave.

Moscow launched air strikes in Syria 10 weeks ago, helping the Syrian army - backed by Iranian troops, Hezbollah fighters and allied militia - to contain rebel advances.

255587,False,1024,"Combine and Conquer Combining sutureless lamellar keratoplasty, phacoemulsification, and IOL implantation in one surgery allows rapid visual rehabilitation in patients with cataract and corneal opacity By Tushar Agarwal and Pooja Bandivadekar

At a Glance Phacoemulsification in patients with corneal opacity can be a challenge – patients with central but superficial opacity and concomitant cataract are common, yet do not typically require a full-thickness transplant

Conventional lamellar keratoplasty has issues, too – problems such as infection and suture-related astigmatism can make outcomes unpredictable

The use of biological glue to adhere the graft to the host cornea can bypass the problem of sutures, and has seen success when performed as a standalone procedure for treating corneal opacity

Combining cataract surgery with automated sutureless anterior lamellar keratoplasty can provide rapid vision rehabilitation, and make phacoemulsification more straightforward for the surgeon

Performing phacoemulsification in a patient with corneal opacity is a challenge, even for an experienced cataract surgeon. Often, we come across patients with central but superficial opacities, and concomitant cataract, who do not warrant a full thickness keratoplasty. One option for these patients is a combined surgery, with a lamellar graft and phacoemulsification. However, conventional lamellar keratoplasty has its own problems, such as suture-related astigmatism and infections, and can be unpredictable.

But there is a way to bypass the problem of sutures – using a biological glue to stick the graft to the host cornea. The results we have witnessed so far of sutureless lamellar keratoplasty, performed as a standalone procedure for the management of corneal opacities, have been encouraging (see Figure 1).

Figure 1. Sutureless anterior lamellar keratoplasty for the management of corneal opacity has returned promising results. (left) Preoperative eye (right) Postoperative eye.

The why and the how

We decided to combine cataract surgery with microkeratome-assisted sutureless anterior lamellar keratoplasty in eyes with visually significant corneal opacity involving less than 200 µm of anterior stroma. This approach enables rapid visual rehabilitation after a single combined surgery (rather than a staged procedure). The residual stromal bed is thick and smooth – which means performing phacoemulsification is less surgically challenging.

In terms of technique, sutureless corneal transplantation can best be described as replacing the 'free LASIK cap', with the cap being taken from a donor cornea.

We performed this triple procedure (lamellar keratoplasty, phacoemulsification and IOL implant) in seven eyes of six patients with anterior stromal corneal opacity. All the procedures were carried out under peribulbar anesthesia, and a Moria microkeratome and artificial chamber (ALK System, Moria) with a 200 µm microkeratome head. For trephination of the host cornea, a suction ring (number 0) was placed over the host cornea, and the same microkeratome head (200 µm) was used to trephine the recipient bed. Phacoemulsification was completed through a 2.7 mm superior incision, and the donor lenticule was then placed on the host bed and any residual fluid from the groove at the graft-host junction was absorbed using merocel sponges. One drop of slow component (thrombin 4) fibrin sealant (Tisseel, Baxter Healthcare) was evenly spread along the edges of the donor cornea, into the groove. No adhesive was applied over the stromal bed. The glue was allowed to act for a period of three minutes, and following this, any excess coagulated glue was removed using the sponge wick. A bandage contact lens was then placed over the cornea and retained for a period of three weeks.

""We have found this surgery to be easily repeatable, with consistent results, and we believe that the fast visual rehabilitation it offers will result in its widespread adoption in the future.""

Better together?

The results were promising. Mean topographic and refractive astigmatism were 2.77 ± 2.6 D and 1 ± 0.65 D, respectively at six months of follow-up. The mean spherical equivalent was -0.7 ± 1.31 D, with a range of -2 D to +1.38 D.

255100,True,512,"Approximately 46 percent of single, uninsured young adults living in 34 of the states with a federal Obamacare marketplace will be able to purchase basic health coverage — a bare-bones ""Bronze"" level plan — for less than $50 per month after factoring in federal tax subsidies, according to a new report by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS).

An even greater number of young and uninsured single adults between the ages of 18 and 34 will be able to get coverage for less than $100 per month, according to government data. ""Of [the 2.9 million] potentially Marketplace-eligible uninsured single young adults, approximately 1.9 million… may be able to pay $100 or less per month in 2014,"" wrote the report authors. That's nearly two-thirds of young adults who qualify for Obamacare marketplace coverage in the 34 states.

An additional one million young adults will also now qualify for Medicaid coverage under Obamacare's expansion of the program. All told, the report finds that 40 percent of the 7.2 million young, uninsured adults living in the 34 states will be able to get coverage for $100 per month or less thanks to the health law. That works out to be 2.9 million people.

If all of the 34 states had chosen to expand Medicaid, however, that number would actually spike to 6.2 million people. That's because many young adults earn little enough money to qualify for the program under Obamacare's Medicaid expansion.

Advertisement

Earlier independent studies have found that families who qualify for Obamacare's subsidies will get an average annual credit of $5,548 per year to help pay for insurance under the law. That would cover a full 66 percent of these families' health premiums. A September report by HHS also found that 6.4 million Americans across all ages can get insurance through Obamacare's marketplaces for less than $100 per month.

Those figures provide a contrast with recent reports that the health law is driving up individual policy premiums and even causing consumers to get cancellation notices from insurers. These stories tend to ignore the reality that many of these plans allure customers with deceptively low monthly premiums, but offer skimpy benefits, fail to cover out-of-pocket costs, and come loaded with high deductibles that are of little help in the case of a medical emergency. Obamacare marketplace plans must offer a wider variety of benefits, cannot deny people based on having a pre-existing medical condition, and limit cost-sharing depending on a person's income.",0.574108309466131,0.774108309466131,-0.1,-0.1
256958,True,795,"The ACLU today submitted a request to the Department of Justice and the FBI asking for the release of all documents relating to President Donald Trump's decision to remove FBI Director James Comey from office. The cloud of uncertainty swirling over Comey's dismissal, along with indications that the president may have gravely abused his power, demands a public accounting.

DEMAND A SPECIAL PROSECUTOR ON RUSSIA

At the time of his dismissal, FBI Director Comey was responsible for overseeing an ongoing investigation into Russian interference in the presidential election and possible collusion between Trump campaign officials and the Russian government. According to initial White House statements — by most accounts hastily assembled with little coordination — the president dismissed Comey on the recommendation of Attorney General Jeff Sessions and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein. The two, we learned, had prepared a pair of memoranda asserting that Comey had mishandled the investigation of Hillary Clinton's private email server and had violated Department of Justice policies when he publicly announced the results of that investigation. (This, despite the fact that both Sessions and Trump had previously lauded Comey's handling of that investigation.)

Subsequent reports indicate that the president had already decided to fire Comey — among other reasons, for being insufficiently loyal to the president — and that he sought the help of Sessions and Rosenstein to justify his decision. Several days after the dismissal, the president said in an interview that he fired Comey because ""he's a showboat, he's a grandstander."" President Trump also stated that he had the Russia investigation in mind when he fired Mr. Comey, and media accounts indicate that Mr. Comey had requested additional resources for the FBI's investigation in the days before he was dismissed. In other words, the White House's explanations for firing Comey shifted significantly over a matter of days, and the public doesn't know the actual basis for the decision.

As the nation's predominant law enforcement agency, the FBI's impact on American justice can't be overstated. Our history offers important lessons into why the FBI director role needs to be insulated from political interference. In response to both Watergate and a litany of abuses wrought by J. Edgar Hoover's five-decade tenure as FBI director, Congress established a 10-year term meant to both check the director's power and insulate the position from party politics. The FBI plays a central role in defending the rule of law, conducting domestic law enforcement investigations, and protecting against civil rights and civil liberties violations. As a result, the agency has tremendous power to affect the lives of ordinary people — for good or ill. Its use of those powers should not be affected by political interests.

The president's actions and shifting justifications threaten the rule of law. As both Trump and his deputy press secretary suggested, by firing Mr. Comey, Trump sought to hasten an end to the FBI's ongoing investigation into his own campaign. But the rule of law requires that investigators and prosecutors have the independence to follow the facts wherever they lead — even if they lead to the president's door. It is a firmly rooted tradition in our democracy that the president does not interfere with individual criminal investigations — let alone those that implicate the president's own interests or the interests of his family, friends, or political associates.

To intervene in such an investigation, or to obstruct its progress, threatens to place the president above the law. It would subvert our system of justice, which requires the FBI and Department of Justice to hold even the most powerful to account. For these reasons, the ACLU has called for the appointment of a special prosecutor and the establishment of a select committee to investigate the Trump campaign's ties to Russian interference. We have also called for the acting FBI director to permanently lead the Russia investigation. At this stage, this is the best way to ensure the investigation's independence.

Meanwhile, we cannot afford to be kept in the dark on the president's actual reasons for firing the FBI director.",0.844687890630446,0.844687890630446,0.0,0.0

258942,True,594,"After much thought and consideration, I have decided that from next year we should start referring to Mother's Day as ""No To Infanticide Day,"" or NTI-Day for short.

This needs to be done in order to call attention to the sad fact that most children who are killed by a parent are killed by their mother. While I acknowledge that most women aren't out there killing their kids, it should be clear to any right thinking individual that infanticide is a serious problem, and that the bad actions of a few women are more than enough justification for spoiling the entire day for all mothers.

Given the selfless nature of women in general and mothers in particular, I have no doubt that this idea will have the support of all mothers, who I am sure will be willing to put the safety of children over their own selfish need for attention and praise. I also expect that it will draw the support of celebrity mothers from the twin worlds of show business and politics, and that prominent women will be lining up to take part in online campaigns — with a little luck we may even be able to get Oprah Winfrey to do a few TV commercials.

Another thing I would like to see happening on NTI Day is women wearing bracelets and shirts bearing inscriptions such as ""I pledge to not smother my toddler,"" and ""I swear not to microwave the baby."" I realize that some oversensitive individuals will object to this on the grounds that promising not to do something implies that you are capable of doing it to begin with, but such naysayers are merely immature ""women"" who will hopefully be ignored by their more highly evolved sisters. It would also be helpful to have a few NTI-Day marches to highlight the problem. Women who are mothers, or who are planning to some day become mothers, would march down the main street bearing placards and banners with slogans such as ""Only women can stop Infanticide"" and ""I am a potential child-killer."" Each march would terminate in a large public space such as a town square or a park, where the assembled women would, in unison, recite the NTI-Day Pledge. Of course, the ultimate wording of the pledge is up to women themselves, but I suggest something along these lines….

""I hereby pledge to never do nasty things like slamming a carving knife through a five year old's skull, feeding a noisy newborn to the neighbor's pitbull, or throwing my toddler into a woodchipper. Nor shall I condone such actions when carried out by other women, and if I am witness to such actions I promise to call the police as soon as is convenient.""

I realize this will be a controversial idea to many, but I have faith that, after some discussion, the mothers of the world will decide to do the right thing and dedicate their special day to the eradicating of all forms of violence against children.",0.8480067131216598,0.8480067131216598,0.0,0.0
255486,False,1024,"SACRAMENTO — Facing a torrent of accusations, a for-profit company that operates taxpayer-funded online charter schools throughout California has reached a $168.5 million settlement with the state over claims it manipulated attendance records and overstated its students' success.

The deal, announced Friday by Attorney General Kamala Harris, comes almost three months after the Bay Area News Group published an investigation of K12 Inc., a publicly traded Virginia company, which raked in more than $310 million in state funding over the past 12 years operating a profitable but low-performing network of ""virtual"" schools for about 15,000 students.

""Knowing that something will be done to address the schools' problems is very reassuring,"" said Gabriela Novak, who pulled her daughter Elizabeth from K12's San Mateo County school after a year of frustrations and difficulty communicating with her teachers. ""Finally, the system is working.""

Harris' office found that K12 and the 14 California Virtual Academies used deceptive advertising to mislead families about students' academic progress, parents' satisfaction with the program and their graduates' eligibility for University of California and California State University admission — issues that were exposed in this news organization's April report.

The settlement could help spur legislation that would prevent for-profit companies like K12 from operating public schools in California.

The Attorney General's office also found that K12 and its affiliated schools collected more state funding from the California Department of Education than they were entitled to by submitting inflated student attendance data and that the company leaned on the nonprofit schools to sign unfavorable contracts that put them in a deep financial hole.

""K12 and its schools misled parents and the State of California by claiming taxpayer dollars for questionable student attendance, misstating student success and parent satisfaction and loading nonprofit charities with debt,"" Harris said in a statement. ""This settlement ensures K12 and its schools are held accountable and make much-needed improvements.""

The California Teachers Association and the California Charter Schools Association both applauded Harris' announcement and denounced the company's practices — even though the two special-interest groups are frequently foes.

But in a news release Friday, K12 stressed that it had admitted no wrongdoing and insisted it had already planned to take up several of the 60 corrective actions required under the agreement over the next few years. It also disputed the attorney general's description of the size of the settlement, calling it ""flat wrong.""

""Despite our full cooperation throughout the process, the Office of the Attorney General grossly mischaracterized the value of the settlement just as it did with regard to the issues it investigated,"" K12 Chief Executive Officer Stuart Udell said in the statement.

Under the settlement, which is subject to court approval, K12 will pay $8.5 million to settle the state's claims.

It also agreed to ""expunge"" about $160 million in credits it has issued to the California Virtual Academies since 2005 that have helped the schools cover the cost of the contracts they hold with the company, whose rates routinely exceed what the schools can afford.

But Udell said that the credits should be called ""subsidies,"" not debts, and that the company's commitment to expunge them shouldn't be used by Harris to hike the size of the settlement. He also defended the credits, saying they had protected the schools against financial uncertainties.

""(The) schools have not paid that money to K12 and K12 never expected to receive it given California's funding environment,"" Udell said.

This news organization's investigation into K12's California schools revealed the company reaps tens of millions of dollars annually in state funding while graduating fewer than half of its high school students. It also showed that kids who spend as little as one minute during a school day logged onto K12's software may have been counted as ""present"" in records used to calculate the amount of funding the schools get from the state.

The revelations show why California needs tighter rules for online charter schools, said Bruce Fuller, an education policy professor at UC Berkeley.

""Virtual charter schools' profit-seeking too often leads to deception about their true effectiveness,"" Fuller said. ""The Legislature should move aggressively to prevent such harm to students and taxpayers.""

The settlement requires K12 to take a slew of corrective actions.

The company must: ensure the accuracy of its advertisements, train teachers to prevent improper attendance claims and reform the way K12 contracts with the California Virtual Academies.

K12 must also eliminate any type of incentive compensation for its enrollment staff, provide all students functional computers and give families a subsidy of at least $20 per month to cover the cost of high-speed internet service.

Emily Bertelli, a spokeswoman for the California Charter Schools Association, called the settlement ""a good start,"" but said the Legislature must change the law to prevent such abusive practices from happening again.

256745,True,907,"Questions of why creators create, how they structure their days, and where they look for inspiration hold a strange kind of mesmerism over us mere mortals, an elusive promise of somehow reverse-engineering and absorbing genius through voyeurism. In 2003, artist Joe Fig began interviewing famous painters about how, where, and why they do what they do. The result was Inside the Painter's Studio (UK; public library) — an anthology of 24 conversations with some of today's most revered contemporary artists. Among them was legendary photorealist Chuck Close, who despite his paralyzing 1988 spinal artery collapse remains one of the most prolific, disciplined, and sought-after artists working today.

In the interview, Close echoes Tchaikovsky and Jack White in the supremacy of work ethic over ""inspiration"":

I was never one of those people who had to have a perfect situation to paint in. I can make art anywhere, anytime — it doesn't matter. I mean, I know so many artists for whom having the perfect space is somehow essential. They spend years designing, building, outfitting the perfect space, and then when it is just about time to get to work they'll sell that place and build another one. It seems more often than not a way to keep from having to work. But I could paint anywhere. I made big paintings in the tiniest bedrooms, garages, you name it. you know, once I have my back to the room, I could be anywhere.

When asked about the motto or creed by which he lives, Close puts it even more forcefully, negating the notion of creative block:

Inspiration is for amateurs — the rest of us just show up and get to work. And the belief that things will grow out of the activity itself and that you will — through work — bump into other possibilities and kick open other doors that you would never have dreamt of if you were just sitting around looking for a great 'art idea.' And the belief that process, in a sense, is liberating and that you don't have to reinvent the wheel every day. Today, you know what you'll do, you could be doing what you were doing yesterday, and tomorrow you are gonna do what you did today, and at least for a certain period of time you can just work. If you hang in there, you will get somewhere. […] I never had painter's block in my whole life.

Indeed, like many famous creators, Close enacts this belief in his own daily routine:

On a typical country day I am painting by nine, and I usually work until noon. Three hours in the morning. I will have lunch either at my desk, or if it's nice I will go to the pool. Of if it's really nice I will go to the beach for an hour. Have lunch on the beach perhaps, and then I come back and I paint from one to four, another three hours, and about then the light is failing, and I am beginning to fuck up. So then my nurse usually comes at four, and I stop working, clean up, have a big drink, and that's a typical day. I work every day out there, every single day.

Close closes by offering emerging artists some words of advice on creative autonomy:

I think while appropriation has produced some interesting work … for me, the most interesting thing is to back yourself into your own corner where no one else's answers will fit. You will somehow have to come up with your own personal solutions to this problem that you have set for yourself because no one else's answers are applicable. […] See, I think our whole society is much too problem-solving oriented. It is far more interesting to [participate in] 'problem creation' … You know, ask yourself an interesting enough question and your attempt to find a tailor-made solution to that question will push you to a place where, pretty soon, you'll find yourself all by your lonesome — which I think is a more interesting place to be.

Then again, there's always the question of whether it's at all possible — or desirable — to fully purge ourselves of influences, given everything we create is an amalgamation of our lived experience, our ""personal micro-culture,"" without which we'd be unable to come up with ""new,"" combinatorial ideas.

256432,True,941,"It is the stuff of spy novels, but a new investigation published Monday reveals that the U.S. Pentagon for years funneled millions to a charity organization employing it to serve as the front group for global espionage—very real revelations that experts warn could have dangerous implications for aid workers worldwide.

After a months-long investigation, The Intercept's Matthew Cole, with help from Margot Williams and Lee Fang, exposes the reach of a highly-classified Department of Defense program, which ran from December 2004 to 2013.

The program was reportedly the ""brainchild"" of Lt. Gen. William ""Jerry"" Boykin, an evangelical Christian who served under President George W. Bush. After the 9/11 attacks, Boykin was charged with expanding the intelligence gathering arm of the DoD and, ""taking a page from the CIA's playbook,"" began tapping NGOs to use as a cover for Pentagon espionage operations.

The exposé highlights one group, the Colorado Springs-based Christian organization Humanitarian International Services Group, or HISG, whose founder, Kay Hiramine, had for years been on the Pentagon payroll and whose organization reportedly had millions funneled to it via a ""complex web"" of private trusts and nonprofits.

The Pentagon reportedly employed HISG, which provided disaster relief and supplies to poor and war-torn countries, to infiltrate North Korea to gain access and information regarding its nuclear program—relying on the organization's ""unwitting"" employees, volunteers, and contacts to do so.

The Intercept reports:

The Pentagon tasked Hiramine with gathering the intelligence it needed inside North Korea, and Hiramine would in turn utilize HISG's access to the country to complete the assignments, according to two former military officials with knowledge of the effort. Hiramine, in his role as CEO of HISG, tapped Christian missionaries, aid workers, and Chinese smugglers to move equipment into and around North Korea — none of whom had any idea that they were part of a secret Pentagon operation. ... Because American intelligence has so few assets inside North Korea, much of Hiramine's task was to find transportation routes to move military equipment — and potentially clandestine operatives — in and around the country. The Pentagon would eventually move sensors and small radio beacons through Hiramine's transportation network, according to another former military official. Much of what Hiramine was doing was what the military refers to as ""operational preparation of the environment,"" or OPE, a category that encompasses clandestine intelligence gathering and prepositioning equipment inside a country for future conflicts.

In one early ""test run,"" an HISG shipment of charity clothing included a secret cache of Bibles in order to see if supplies could get into the country without being discovered.

As Cole notes, HISG ""was one of several NGOs used by the Pentagon in this way. Some, like HISG, already existed as fledgling organizations, while others were created from scratch by the Pentagon.""

The investigation's findings, ""that the Pentagon used an NGO and unwitting humanitarian volunteers for intelligence gathering,"" constitutes a major transgression and threatens the safety and work of aid organizations worldwide.

Sam Worthington, president of InterAction, an association of nearly 200 American NGOs, told the reporters that such activity ""violates international principles"" and places legitimate aid and development workers at great risk.

""It is unacceptable that the Pentagon or any other U.S. agency use nonprofits for intelligence gathering,"" Worthington said. ""It is a violation of the basic trust between the U.S. government and its civic sector.""

Indeed, a CIA-directed mission in 2011 which employed a Pakistani doctor to gather DNA samples of Osama bin Laden's presumed family members, under the guise of a hepatitis vaccination program, has resulted in numerous attacks on ""legitimate"" medical groups.

Further, as noted by Sarah Knuckey, Columbia Law professor and director of the school's Human Rights Clinic, these findings also give ""rhetorical ammo"" to repressive governments seeking to restrict NGO activities within their borders.

HISG was reportedly shuttered in 2013 after Adm. William McRaven shut down the North Korean spying operation the year before. It's ""unclear"" if President Obama was ever briefed on the program, The Intercept notes, and the White House declined to comment.

The Intercept investigation relied on interviews with more than a dozen current and former military and intelligence officials, humanitarian aid workers, missionaries, U.S. officials, as well as former HISG staffers. The Pentagon provided no comment on HISG or the espionage operations in North Korea.",0.8088482712593477,0.8088482712593477,0.0,0.0

We checked the facts and Ted Cruz is wrong--McCain was NOT born in Panama, but in the Panama Canal Zone, which at that time was a US. territory. Cruz claims, falsely, that McCain was the child of soldiers abroad--that would have been the case if McCain's parents had crossed the border to the country of Panama, but they chose to stay in U.S. territory.

CLEVELAND- The Cleveland Division of Police released new information on the deadly shooting that claimed the lives of 5 people Friday night, and injured a child.

Cleveland police say two men and two women, were shot and killed at a home on East 92nd and Wade Park Ave. around 7:30 p.m.

According to police, 41-year-old Sherita L. Johnson pulled into the driveway of the home to let her 9-year-old daughter go inside to grab some clothes. When the girl open the door to the home she saw it was out of order. A masked man appeared and shot the girl two times in the chest.

Johnson, who was 28-weeks pregnant, was shot inside of her car. Her two-year-old son, who was in the backseat of the car, was unhurt.

Johnson was taken to University Hospitals Case Medical Center where she was treated and died Friday night.

According to the Medical Examiner's Office, Johnson's unborn baby, a boy, was also pronounced dead at the hospital.

A 60-year-old man, 19-year-old man, and 17-year-old girl were found dead inside the home. Their identities have not yet been released.

The 9-year-old girl, who witnessed the shooting, was taken to Rainbow Babies & Children's Hospital. Authorities say she's expected to be okay.

Cleveland City Council President Kevin Kelley and Councilman TJ Dow released the following statements about the horrific crime.

""For too long Cleveland has suffered the consequences of gun violence,"" said Council President Kevin J. Kelley. ""As we grieve the unnecessary loss of life in the multiple incidents this weekend we are reminded of the importance of implementing gun legislation with Mayor Jackson. Our thoughts and prayers go out to these and every family who has lost a loved one at the hands of guns.""

""Today, with heavy hearts, my community mourns tragedy striking our neighborhood and knows more than ever the importance of community,"" said Councilman TJ Dow. ""Any loss of life, particularly a child, is unforgiveable. While we have suffered ups and downs in the past years, together we will move forward and I pledge to remember and fight for the safety of East Cleveland and work through all avenues available to a solution.""

There's nothing like a major GPU release and subsequent price war to wake the market up.

AMD unveiled its next-generation GPUs, codenamed Hawaii, back in September. The product promptly topped Nvidia's big guns, sparking price cuts and a surprisingly quick response. You can also add in a not-so-little update to Intel's Xeon product line with Ivy Bridge-E (third generation Core i-series) for the God Box. And to complement all the high-end product news, there was the release of the dual-core desktop versions of Intel's current 4th-generation (Haswell) Core i-series processors, ensuring top-to-bottom product refreshes for the two most critical components inside the System Guide.

As for the rest of the computing industry, at least as far as the System Guide is concerned, it has experienced much more gradual change since the last update.

SSDs (solid state disks), hard disks, power supplies, cases, and even monitors have seen only incremental improvements at best. However, the impact of additional maturity should not be underestimated—particularly now that 4K (3840×2160) monitors have enough video card to drive them for (well-off) mortals.

Today we'll continue to focus more on the tangible benefits for the System Guide: better overall performance and performance for your dollar (aka value) while trying to stay within the average enthusiast's budget for a new system.

System Guide fundamentals

The main Ars System Guide is a three-system affair, with the traditional Budget Box, Hot Rod, and God Box addressing three different price points in the market from modest to a little crazy. The main System Guide's boxes are general-purpose systems with a strong gaming focus, which results in fairly well-rounded machines suitable for most enthusiast use. They also make a solid starting point to spin off into a variety of configurations.

The low end of the scale, the Budget Box, is still a capable gaming machine despite its reasonable price tag ($600-$800). A few bucks toward a decent discrete video card give it some punch for gaming, while sufficient CPU power and memory ensure it's good for everything else. The Hot Rod represents what we think is a solid, higher-end, general-purpose computer that packs plenty of gaming performance. We've adjusted the price tag a few times in the past, from $1,400 to $1,600 down to $1,200 to $1,400... and most recently back up to the old point to reflect new capabilities and jumps in performance. The God Box remains a showcase or a starting point for workstation builders or enthusiasts who believe in overkill with a capital ""O."" It may not do exactly what you want, but it should be an excellent starting point for anyone with a good idea of their truly high-end computing needs—be it gaming to excess after winning the lottery, taking advantage of GPU computing, or storing and editing tons of HD video. Beyond the basics As a side note, we do address other systems in our occasional Specialty System Guides: green computing, more gaming-focused setups at slightly different price points, an even a lower-cost office box known as the Bargain Box, HTPCs, and others. A particularly large gap exists between the Hot Rod and God Box, which is filled by the occasional Performance Gaming Box. If you don't see anything that interests you here, please feel free to check out three of our latest guides below:

Ars Gaming Boxes, April 2013

Ars Bargain Box, February 2013


For the short version: the Budget Box is for those who are seeking the most bang for their buck. The Hot Rod is for enthusiasts with a larger budget who still know that there's a sweet spot between performance and price. The God Box, as excessive as it is, always has a slight dose of moderation (as mentioned in previous guides, ""God wouldn't be a glutton"").

Each box has a full set of recommendations, down to the mouse, keyboard, and speakers. As these are general-purpose boxes, despite the gaming focus, we skip things like game controllers and $100 gaming mice (although the God Box does get something a bit nicer). We also discuss alternative configurations and upgrades.

Operating systems

For the typical System Guide user, this boils down to Windows or Linux, and Windows occupies the vast majority of desktop space. Standard Windows 8.1 does fine for most, while Windows 8.1 Professional includes additional features such as BitLocker, Remote Desktop Connection, and domain support that home users may not need. Windows 7 Home Premium and Professional also sport similar differences while remaining equally viable. Some",0.19614571612328288,0.6961457161232829,-0.4,-0.1

256328,True,772,"Across the country, U.S. cities are removing freeways in an effort to connect areas constricted by transportation planners decades ago. The city of Akron, Ohio, is the latest to reclaim its vehicular infrastructure for its citizens, and it's doing it in a revolutionary way: For three months next summer, a decommissioned freeway will be transformed into a 35-acre park filled with trees.

The Innerbelt National Forest is the idea of Hunter Franks, a San Francisco-based artist who has been working in the Akron community since 2015. He plans to populate the freeway with potted plants, public seating, and programming meant to reconnect the two communities severed by the freeway 40 years ago. The project just received a Knight Cities Challenge grant, which is giving $15 million to projects in 26 American cities.

The concept for the forest originated during a 500-person dinner on the freeway that Franks organized in in 2015, shortly after the road was closed. The guests at the community meal also participated in a visioning exercise where they were asked to write down what the neighborhood needed on butcher paper running down the middle of the tables. ""People said they wanted green space,"" says Franks.

The Innerbelt Freeway, also known as State Route 59, was completed in 1970, and designed to bring economic revitalization to the city's struggling downtown. Yet it was almost immediately declared a failure because it never delivered the volume of cars promised—or the revitalization.

Instead, the freeway devastated the western edge of the city by demolishing historic neighborhoods, namely a African American jazz district, creating a physical divide through the city's urban core. According to Franks, one side of the freeway remains an underserved neighborhood where residents don't have easy access to downtown's cultural assets, while the other side is largely a commercial district populated by middle and upper class workers who commute into the area but don't live there.

What Franks envisions is not just a park, but a chance to connect those two groups and create ""shared empathy"" in the space. Franks will be interviewing local residents, workers downtown, and students from a nearby university to give them investment and ownership in the project.

Although the entire freeway has been decommissioned, with the last mile being demolished and reopened for development, Franks notes that this portion of the freeway will not be dismantled. The freeway itself will more or less remain intact, much in the way that Seoul recently transformed a former highway into a public park. So visitors will have the surreal experience of walking across the lanes where cars once sat in gridlock, surrounded by trees. Just taking away the cars means the area will be much safer: The Innerbelt had a higher than average rate of traffic deaths for the region, including the most dangerous intersection in the city, located on an arterial road that served the freeway.

The forest is set to open in April of 2018, and intended to remain open all summer. And although what the Knight Foundation is funding is just a pilot project, the idea is to test the concept, allow neighbors to give feedback, and use the data to perform future improvements, says Frank. ""Whatever it turns out being permanently, if it's a park or just helps inform the social landscape, that is the opportunity.""

In this way, the temporary nature of the project is almost the most intriguing part—and one that offers the best model for other cities that want to ""test"" a freeway removal before implementing it. Imagine cities giving underperforming highways the summer off, shutting them down for the ultimate open streets event. Just a few months would give neighborhoods the chance to physically reconnect, help emissions and air pollution to drop, and provide citizens with a vision for how much better urban life can be without a freeway running through it.",0.7730364433618433,0.7730364433618433,0.0,0.0

259499,False,1024,"Moving a big software project to a new compiler can be a lot of work, and few projects are bigger than Chromium. In addition to the main Chromium repository, which includes all of Blink, there are over a hundred other open-source projects which Chromium incorporates by reference, totaling more than 48,000 C/C++ files and 40,000 header files. Porting Chromium on Windows to VC++ 2015 requires getting all of these projects to build and run.

As of March 11th 2016 Chromium for Windows has switched from VC++ 2013 to VC++ 2015, and it doesn't look like it's switching back. This will give us more C++ 11 features, new security options, much faster LTCG/PGO builds, and other advantages.

The tracking bug for this project currently has over 330 comments on it, with contributions from dozens of developers. Writing about all of those changes would require an entire book. So I'm going to focus on my favorite part of this project – compiler bugs. In particular, bugs where the compiler silently generates incorrect code.

Update: another code-gen bug in VS 2015 was found on March 31st, and worked around about two weeks later. A VC++ bug was filed. And another silent-bad-code-gen bug was found in September 2016, and worked around a few days later.

If you throw a diverse enough set of code at a compiler, build it in lots of different ways, run lots of tests, and ship the code to customers, you're going to find some bugs.

Because Chromium is open source I will include links to Chromium bugs and fixes where possible, in addition to links to the VC++ bug reports.

I didn't find all of these bugs, but it was my job to investigate them, come up with a minimal repro, and report them to Microsoft. And I have to say that the Microsoft team was amazing. They were very supportive, and helpful, and it was clear that they really wanted VC++ 2015 to be as good as possible, and that includes building Chromium. We had an excellent symbiotic relationship: I fed them high quality bug reports, and they fixed them incredibly quickly.

Anyone can file VC++ bugs at the connect website. Getting your bugs noticed is easier if you work for Google, but anyone who files quality bugs can get help. The VC++ MVP program lets ordinary developers who participate in the VC++ community get privileged access to the VC++ team. Recommended – I enjoyed being a VC++ MVP before joining Google.

Chromium is open source so Microsoft can theoretically reproduce any of these bugs if I just tell them what source file to compile and where to look. But that can be a slow process. If the repro steps for your bug includes ""Download 90,000 source files and our custom build system and compile for hours"" then you can't expect priority service.

This is especially true because most reports of bugs in compilers are erroneous – most 'compiler bugs' are actually bugs in the code being compiled, such as invoking undefined behavior. So, I always had to prove to myself that these were compiler bugs before reporting them, which usually meant simplifying the repro case to make it trivially obvious that the compiler was at fault. I've discussed techniques for doing this before.

Failed Chromium

After getting all of Chromium building the next step was to start running Chromium. It would run fine once, but on subsequent runs I'd hit an assert. I suspected a code-gen bug but it was not the case. The problem ultimately turned out to be this code:

HandleWrapper h(CreateMutex(…));

if (h.HandleIsInvalid() && GetLastError() == SOME_ERROR_CODE) …

It turns out that the HandleWrapper class allocates memory, and the debug version of the VC++ 2015 CRT allocations functions call the FlsGetValue function, and FlsGetValue calls SetLastError(0) because it is so incredibly proud that it succeeded. SetLastError(0) destroys the error code from CreateMutex, and madness ensues. I filed a bug and tweeted about this and it turned into a fun little twitter discussion with opinions about evenly split between ""if memory allocation affects LastError then Armageddon is imminent"" and ""if you assume memory allocation won't affect LastError then you are Satan"".

This way of using HandleWrapper is very convenient and is pervasive in Chromium so fixing all of the uses seemed impractical so instead the HandleWrapper constructor now preserves and then restores LastError. Some other misuses of GetLastError were also fixed.

This was not a compiler code-gen bug, but I wanted to include it because the twitter storm was wonderful.

Microsoft decided to fix the bug which I assumes means that they are choosing Satan over Armageddon.

Rated 5 out of 5 by Fourbee from Looks great, even with a novice installer! I had never installed a laminate floor, but I thought this would look pretty good in my rental house. It took me a couple of rows to get the hang of installing it, but it snapped together very easily. I took my time, with plenty of breaks, and still finished 240 square feet in 4 hours. I was amazed at the difference in the room! It looks amazing and I could hardly believe that a novice installer could produce such beautiful work. I didn't even use the installation kit-just a rubber mallet! It's a beautiful, durable floor that I'll be proud to show to prospective tenants! Heck, I may just go ahead and do the bedrooms, as well! I love it!!!

Rated 5 out of 5 by MrFloorman from Great Deal for a Great Floor Breakage - non existent unless you really try to break it. Seams - fits perfectly. not invisible like some people think they will be, but it's not even noticeable Feel - It feels quite like real wood and doesn't stick to your feet. -Tips - -of course your going to need a saw, either a circular saw, table saw, or hand saw will work. I didn't have a jigsaw but it would be really helpful in some places. -Installation kit i got was a little pricey for a block of plastic and a piece of metal but it was invaluable. kit works good with any old hammer. -underlay rolls are good for padding and moisture protection and doesn't raise the price a whole lot like the floors with underlay attached already. This was my first laminate installation and I did it like a pro and you can too.

Rated 4 out of 5 by Colten970 from Very happy with this flooring!!! First off all, I have never done laminate flooring so this was a learn as you go kind of thing. I would recommend watching some youtube videos, they help! The first 2 rows from the wall were the hardest to get started as nothing would line up. You learn that your walls are not perfectly straight! However, after you fight those first 2 rows everything goes super smooth and simple! ***Important*** As big of a waste of money those kits with the rubber bumper and pull bar seem, DO NOT SKIP OUT ON IT! You will destroy the planks if you try using anything else! trust me, I learned the hard way! Overall, I am very happy with the outcome! Today is day 5 after installation and its still beautiful! Its fairly durable, We have no scratches so far...

Rated 5 out of 5 by KamTX from Good floor, easy install, nice color, and really affordable. Saw this online and found a store that had quite a few boxes in stock local. First thing was I Read the instructions and install went really smooth. Planks Locked in place perfect (I wouldn't tap to hard when locking them in, just tap right until you see the gap close flush and no more) and I maybe had only 2 wood planks out of 18 boxes that were not usable. Its been a few months since I did the install, so far no problems. Has been holding up quite well.

Rated 5 out of 5 by acsparkle from Stunning Flooring I recently upgraded my condo with this flooring. I hired a general contractor to install the flooring even though is says diy. Regardless the flooring is magnificent! Everybody that sees the place in person or via pictures says the flooring is amazing. I used a white trim as the shoe and in between the stairs. The quality of the laminate is awesome, don't let the price fool you. This is a great product.

Bernie Sanders's Secret Service detail got a workout Monday night when agents rushed in to pull Sanders away from a podium after protesters charged the barricades at an Oakland, California, rally. At least four protesters were intercepted and arrested, reports CNN, after they tried to push toward the candidate.

Sanders, who's closing in on Hillary Clinton ahead of next week's California primary, was totally okay. The crowd of about 20,000 booed the protesters and erupted into cheers of ""Bernie, Bernie"" after Secret Service agents pulled the unruly audience members away. Sanders pressed forward with his speech after the interruption. ""We don't get intimidated easily."" He recovered by watching game seven of the Golden State–Oklahoma City series with supporter Danny Glover. (The locals triumphed.)

According to NBC News, the people arrested belonged to the animal-rights group Direct Action Everywhere. About two dozen activists had showed up at the rally. The group released a statement after the chaos saying it's not anti-Sanders; it just wants the candidate to embrace a stronger animal-rights and anti-factory-farming platform. Per the group, the members weren't trying to protest so as to persuade Bernie, or, as the group outlined its strategy, ""[A]ctivists do not protest at Bernie Sanders rallies in opposition to Sanders himself, but rather to pull Sanders in their direction.""

255808,True,933,"Ahead of their first full series in India since 2009, Sri Lanka have arrived in the country with a bagful of trivia material and scores to settle. It is one thing that the last of their 17 Tests in India came eight years ago, but quite another that Sri Lanka haven't won even one of those dating back to 1982. Only two survivors - Angelo Mathews and Rangana Herath - remain from the side that went down 2-0 in the three-Test series in 2009, but it isn't as if members of the current squad are without scars.

After all, it was only around August that Sri Lanka were blanked 9-0 across formats at home by a dominant India side. Between then and now, Sri Lanka had a rollercoaster ride in the UAE, where, after a surprise takedown of Pakistan to sweep the two-match Test series, they lost all the eight limited-overs matches on tour. And so, Sri Lanka have to reset and start from scratch as their young squad, led by Dinesh Chandimal, braces for a bruising examination from an India side that has proved to be near-invincible at home in the recent years. Coach Nic Pothas, though, insisted that the team's culture had changed for the better. More pointedly, he stressed on the need to not be ""infatuated"" with India's strengths and focus on Sri Lanka's game plans instead.

""The mistake you can make here is come and be infatuated with the Indian side and concentrate too much on them,"" Pothas said on the team's arrival in India. ""We know they are a good side. We only played them a month ago. We have to concentrate on our strengths and jobs, and if we can execute them well it will be a challenging series.

""There are not too many people who have the joy of playing India back to back. It's always a pleasure to come here and challenge ourselves against a very, very good team. I think where we have changed is the culture within group. When we took on India [in Sri Lanka], we were all pretty new from the support staff to the players involved. We are now a team that pride ourselves in our culture. We defend it and we focus on ourselves.""

Pothas said the thrashing at home from India had proved to be a sound learning experience, and that the team had absorbed those lessons. ""The series against India was a huge learner for us. I also mentioned that if we didn't learn from a very good team then that would have been the biggest error. We did go back to the lessons we learnt - what India does very, very well and the areas we needed to improve.

""It was a complete different [Test] series against Pakistan. It was 41 degrees and they had lost two legends. That probably made things a little bit easier for us. But the India team is very settled team and all their players are their peak. So it's a completely different challenge, especially here in India. Not many teams have come here in the last few years and won. But what changed for us is internally - the discipline, the culture and how the teams stuck together, the characters that we have picked. As much as the skill and preparation has changed, what we have done internally has changed as well.""

Captain Chandimal, playing his first Test series in India, said the team had been working hard at practice. He also said the batting group had plans to counter the spin threat posed by R Ashwin and Ravindra Jadeja but did not divulge what those were. ""This is my first Test tour to India,"" he said. ""It's a really good challenge for each and every one. As I said, we are doing hard work at practice sessions, especially before coming here, in Bangkok, we did so much hard work at practice. I am sure you can see the new faces - Dasun Shanaka, Dhananjaya de Silva, Roshen Silva, and also Sadeera [Samarawickrama]. I'm sure they will be up for the challenge and do their best in the tournament.

""Against Pakistan, we played six batters and five bowlers that worked really well, especially in the heat it was never easy to play four bowlers and win a game. If you are playing against India... they have got some really good bowlers, so we need to think about that allrounder position. We will look at the pitch and come up with our plans.""",0.4191677827595873,0.7191677827595874,-0.30000000000000004,0.0

NanoStation Loco M2: 2.4GHz Hi Power 2x2 MIMO AirMax TDMA Station - USA Version

The original NanoStation set the bar for the world's first low-cost and efficiently designed outdoor broadband CPE. The new NanoStation M takes the same concept to the future with new redesigned sleek and elegant form-factors.

The NanoStation Loco is a smaller version of the full sized NanoStation. The main differences are the Loco has only one Ethernet port and a smaller, lower gain antenna. It also has a much lower cost. For most customers wanting to connect to a remote public WiFi, or link into another building, the Loco is the better choice. The larger NanoStation would only be required if a second Ethernet port is desired for the purpose of directly attaching a POE enabled device such as an AirCam or a Picostation for retransmitting a new WiFi AP signal.

Featuring a compact indoor/outdoor design and an interface so intuitive even the most technically challenged can instantly become experts. But, don't be fooled; it is as powerful as it is simple. Nanostation packs some phenomenal performance with a revolutionary design combining a hi-gain 4 antenna system, advanced radio architecture, and highly researched and developed firmware technology allowing throughput, stability, and capacity performance rivaling even the highest-end WiMax networks.

258035,True,829,"Image caption Sarah McClay died at Royal Preston Hospital

A zoo keeper who died after being mauled by a tiger may have been ""dragged"" into a pen, police said.

Sarah McClay, 24, was attacked by a Sumatran tiger in an enclosure at South Lakes Wild Animal Park, near Dalton-in-Furness, Cumbria, on Friday.

Cumbria Police said a tiger got from its pen to a staff area of the enclosure where it attacked Ms McClay.

Detectives said either ""human or mechanical"" error could have led to the tiger being in the staff area.

Ms McClay was taken to Preston Royal Hospital where she died of head and neck injuries.

Park owner David Gill said after the attack there was ""no reason"" for Ms McClay to be in the enclosure with the tigers.

'No foul play'

Det Chief Insp Bob Qazi, of Cumbria Police, aid: ""It is vitally important that we discover what exactly happened in the big cat enclosure building that led to Sarah coming into contact with the tiger.

""I want to emphasise there is no suggestion of any foul play or any issue of suicide or self-harm from the enquiries we have made and evidence we have.

""What has become apparent from our enquiries is that Sarah was going about her routine duties and was in the staff section of the enclosure building, which animals are not allowed access to, when a tiger has entered it from an adjacent pen and confronted her.

""The tiger has then attacked Sarah, taking her from the building into the open-air external enclosure area where Sarah was left and later attended by staff and paramedics.

""We are still trying to establish exactly how and why the tiger has been able to get from the pen into the staff area and at the moment believe this to be because of a human or system error, or mechanical failing, or combination of both.""

Police said compartments in the tiger enclosure were connected by lockable doors but systems in place to ensure staff and animals were kept apart had ""failed"".

Mr Gill said Ms McClay, who is originally from Glasgow, was a ""very experienced"" staff member who had worked with big cats and was ""proficient and passionate"" at her job.

Mr Gill described Ms McClay as a ""bubbly, happy girl"" and described her death as a ""tragedy for her family and all the staff"".

Park re-opened

After the attack the park was closed early and visitors evacuated from the area. It reopened on Saturday.

Mr Gill said: ""The public were not at risk and we followed all our accident procedures to the letter.

""We had a meeting of all staff at 5.30pm and asked what they wanted. There was a huge consensus of opinion that we carry on.

""It would not do any good to close the park as there is no safety issue.""

He said the Sumatran tiger, which has lived at the park for 10 years since it was a cub, would not be destroyed.

A statement released by Ms McClay's family thanked paramedics for their ""valiant"" efforts to save her.

The family has set up a donation site in her memory to support red squirrel conservation.

The statement said: ""We'd like to thank you all for your kind words. We are still coming to terms with what has happened.

""We would like to take this opportunity to thank the valiant efforts of Cumbria Ambulance Service, the North West Air Ambulance and the Royal Preston Hospital.

The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has filed a formal rule to remove gray wolves from the federal endangered list in Montana and Idaho while leaving them on the list in Wyoming. The agency filed the rule Wednesday, April 1, 2009, a day ahead of Thursday's publication of the delisting in the Federal Register. (AP Photo/Dawn Villella, file) (Photo: Dawn Villella, AP) Story Highlights Current Michigan law would allow for a wolf hunt in 2015.

Proposals 14-1 and 14-2 will have no authority unless current law overturned via legal challenges.

There will be no Michigan wolf hunt in 2014.

Michigan voters who care whether the state should allow wolf hunting can have their say next week on the general election ballot.

Sort of.

Two proposals are on the Nov. 4 ballot that would either allow or prohibit state officials from holding another public hunting season for wolves. However, both proposals are essentially null and void -- regardless of how Michiganders vote on them -- because of action taken by the Legislature over the summer.

Advocates on both sides of the issue want voters to have their say because the proposals could become important in the future.

The proposals are the result of a complicated political chess match between those who oppose public wolf hunting and those who think it's an important tool for managing the former endangered species.

To help you understand what you're voting on, we talked to the non-partisan Citizens Research Council to put together a primer on both proposals and why they may not matter until the future.

The history

First, Wolves are native to Michigan but were nearly wiped out in the 19th and early 20th centuries by hunting and state-sanctioned bounties.

In 1973, when Congress created the federal endangered species list, only six wolves were known to still exist in the Michigan wild.

Under federal protection, wolf recovery was slow. But starting in 1989, the numbers began to rise in Michigan, Minnesota and Wisconsin, along with the hope that one day the animals would rebound enough to return to state control.

To prepare for that possibility, the state convened a task force in 2005 to create a wolf management plan. Members of the task force included all stakeholders in wolf management, including biologists, representatives of Michigan's Indian tribes, sporting groups and wolf advocates.

An overview of wolves in Michigan

By 2007, the wolf population in the Upper Peninsula topped 500 -- far exceeding the recovery benchmark of 100 set by the federal government, making the Great Lakes gray wolf one of the most successful recovery stories in the history of the endangered species list.

At the same time, however, some Upper Peninsula residents began to complain that wolves were edging too close for comfort. Some farmers reported that wolves were killing livestock, and U.P. citizens reported wolves encroaching on towns and yards.

In 2007, U.S. Fish and Wildlife sought to remove Great Lakes gray wolves from federal protection, but the Humane Society of the United States sued to delay the move. A federal court ruled in favor of the Humane Society, and wolves remained under endangered species protection for several more years.

Finally, in 2012, Great Lakes gray wolves were removed from the endangered species list, putting the state of Michigan back in control of its wolf population.

The conversation - or the debate

Michigan's wolf management plan highlighted several methods for controlling the wolf population once they were removed from the endangered species list, including a potential public wolf hunt.

Read the wolf management plan

In December 2012, less than a year after wolves were removed from the list, the Legislature passed a bill designating wolves game animals. It was signed by Gov. Rick Snyder and became Public Act 520.

The new law cleared the way for the Natural Resources Commission -- a seven-member body appointed by the governor -- to establish a hunting season for wolves.

Proponents, including the state Department of Natural Resources, cited several reasons for backing wolf hunts. The DNR told lawmakers at a hearing that hunting would be one of many tools used by wildlife officials to control the wolf population.

""While the wolf population offers benefits, it also poses significant costs and concerns to some Michigan residents,"" Trevor VanDyke, the DNR's legislative liaison, told a Senate committee. ""This would be another tool that would allow for proper management and implementation of the wolf management plan, and we think we'd use this as a tool to reduce those negative impacts and conflicts with livestock and humans.""

Opponents believed it was too soon to talk about a hunt. At the same hearing, wolf advocate Nancy Warren of the National Wolfwatcher Coalition questioned the scientific need for hunting as a management tool.

256102,False,1024,"A few days ago, Bill Simmons and Kevin Durant met for their fourth Bill Simmons Podcast interview. Part 1 dropped on the heels of the Kyrie Irving–to–Boston trade, and Durant weighed in on Irving's trade request from a player's perspective. But after one of the busiest and most surprising NBA offseasons in recent memory, Simmons and Durant had much more to discuss. In the Part 2 of the podcast, they assessed the other huge trades: Jimmy Butler to Minnesota, Paul George to Oklahoma City, and Chris Paul to Houston. Durant assesses the fit of each player on his new team. Read a portion of their conversation below, and listen to the full episode to hear Durant answer more mailbag questions.

This transcript has been edited and condensed. The full podcast will be released at 3:00 a.m. ET on Monday, August 28.

Bill Simmons: Do you buy the theory that the Warriors shook up the entire NBA and caused all this player-movement chaos that happened?

Kevin Durant: Yeah.

Simmons: Because it's been an especially crazy summer.

Durant: Yeah, I buy it. Yeah.

Simmons: I mean, we've had like five major moves. The 1- and the 2-seed in the Eastern Conference traded A-list starters to each other.

Durant: I don't think that was because of us, but —

Simmons: No, it might have been though.

Durant: No, but a lot of teams making moves because of us. You see Houston making moves because they want to.

Simmons: What was the one that surprised you the most?

Durant: That one.

Simmons: Chris Paul?

Durant: I'm not surprised. I'm sorry. I'm not surprised by anything, but it was just kind of like, ""Hmm, damn. That's a smart move."" I wouldn't think nobody would be that smart to pull that one off.

Simmons: What do you think of James [Harden] and Chris Paul on the same team?

Durant: I think it was a great move. You put two guys together that — crafty with the ball like that — they're going to get everybody shots, and they're going to get each other shots, so it was a ballsy move to pull off by [Daryl] Morey. And I don't think nobody would have thought to do that, because especially when you've got James, who basically plays your point guard, you really have to have some type of clarity when you're making a decision like that. Because it's just like, you played well last year, but this — he cannot sustain this. You gotta know that. You can't; just look at the numbers. So you can tell that he's actually seeing some stuff within this team. He's paying attention.

Simmons: What about PG to OKC?

Durant: That was a shock too.

Simmons: PG was one of your favorite opponents.

Durant: Oh yeah. Yeah. Any 3-man that I feel — all the 3s that play my position. That's the only players I'm really rivaling with. Like, I don't rival with no other players. I'm not guarding a point guard all game, or guarding shooting guards or power forwards. I'm looking at only small forwards, so that's why I've got so much respect, and I think Paul George is so good. A lot of people disrespect him. Because I play against him and I respect my position.

So that was shocking because Indiana just gave him away. And I ain't think OKC would even think about giving up anything to trade for him. I didn't think they would do it, but that was a ballsy move.

Simmons: OKC has the third-highest payroll this year. I don't know if you noticed that.

Durant: Good. Spend it.

Simmons: Steven Adams, Paul George, Westbrook, Andre Roberson, and who's the fifth guy in crunch time for them. I'm blanking.

Durant: Patrick Patterson.

Simmons: So that's their crunch time, probably. That's a good spot.

Durant: No, no, no. It's going to be, they going to try, they're going to probably go Russ, uhh, who's the sixth man?

Simmons: Kanter?

Durant: They need a — I think there's another wing they might use and put PG at the 4 and put Steven at the 5.

Simmons: I think they're going to —

Durant: They need another wing.

259898,False,1024,"The Stanley Cup Final heads to Nashville for the first time ever as the Pittsburgh Penguins look to take a stranglehold on the series. Starting at a possible 3-0 series deficit, the Predators cannot afford to lose game three on their home ice. The Bridgestone Arena is absolutely rocking for its first ever Stanley Cup Final game. Here is how game three played out.

As expected, the fans in Nashville are into it as the puck gets dropped, however, the crowd is quickly silenced just 2:46 into the game as, who else, Jake Guentzel slides the puck under Rinne's pads and gives Pittsburgh a 1-0 lead. This is Guentzel's 13th goal of the playoffs.

Another look at Guentzel's goal pic.twitter.com/rjcMtZ7xcO — Pete Blackburn (@PeteBlackburn) June 4, 2017

The Predators would respond to the early goal with a solid push throughout the rest of the period, however, Murray was standing tall in net. The Guentzel goal would be the lone tally in the first period, so after 1 it was Penguins 1, Predators 0.

The second period started and Nashville came out like it was the last period of their season. They were absolutely flying around the ice, and the crowd loved it. Justin Schultz would take a minor penalty for holding, putting Nashville on the power play, and they took advantage.

Roman Josi would fire a slap shot that would deflect off of the Penguins' defender and just go over Murray's pad. The Bridgestone Arena would erupt as Nashville ties the game 1-1 5:51 into the second period. The goal was Josi's 6th of the playoffs.

But Nashville was not done there.

Under a minute after Josi's goal, Frederick Gaudreau would walk into the slot and whistle a wrist shot over the glove of Murray and give Nashville the lead, 2-1. The goal came at 6:33 and was Gaudreau's 2nd of the playoffs.

The second period would continue to be Nashville's up until defenseman Ryan Ellis would get called for a boarding penalty. The boarding was a minor penalty and gave Pittsburgh an opportunity to tie the game up. They could not capitalize on the chance and shortly after Nashville would strike again.

With less than 30 seconds to go in the second period, James Neal would find an opening on the left side of the net and bank the puck in off of an unsuspecting Murray. The goal once again sent the crowd into a frenzy and also gave Nashville a 3-1 lead. The goal came at 19:37 of the period and was Neal's 6th of the playoffs.

The third period would start much like the second period, with Nashville putting a goal on the board. Nashville's Craig Smith would take advantage of a gift wrapped break away chance after Chris Kunitz tried to deke around teammate Phil Kessel. The puck would deflect off of Kessel's skate, leading to the great chance for Smith. Bad luck for Pittsburgh, as Nashville would take a commanding 3 goal lead in the third period. The goal was Smith's first of the playoffs.

The Penguins would try to claw their way back into the game, but this night belonged to the Predators as Rinne stood tall and gave Pittsburgh no opportunity of making a comeback. Rinne desperately needed to put on a good performance, as he had been the scapegoat for Predator fans so far in this series after the first two games. Not tonight, however, as he would stop 27 of 28 shots, leading to a .964 save percentage.

Nashville would tally another goal late in the third period to seal the deal in game three. Defenseman Mattias Ekholm would skate uncontested down the slot and rifle a slap shot past the blocker of Murray, making it 5-1 Nashville. It was Ekholm's first goal of the playoffs.

William Safire's entertaining ''Auguring Well'' (Jan. 21) referred to the option the President has to ''swear'' or ''affirm'' his intention to execute the duties of office. Mr. Safire mistakenly noted, ''Of the 40 men who have taken that oath, only Herbert Hoover chose 'affirm.' ''

Franklin Pierce, our 14th President, chose to ''affirm'' rather than to ''swear.''

He did this as a result of the death of his 11-year-old son, Benjamin, killed in a train accident about two months before Pierce took the oath. Pierce believed the death of his son was a punishment for his sins, so he did not employ the Bible during the inauguration. This action necessitated substituting ''affirm'' for ''swear.''

I remember when I was five or six years old, waking up one morning and seeing this guy bust through the TV screen, rapping over some song called "" We Want Eazy "" -- I think the concept of the video was that he was actually in jail and he had to get to his show and the only way to get to his concert was to film him from jail, and he eventually busted through the jail and came onstage. I remember looking at that video and just feeling like, ""Man, this dude feels like an action superhero."" Little did I know, Eazy-E came from my same neighborhood in Compton.My pops would play N.W.A. records all day, every day; my uncles would play it. My older cousins would play it. And I would go outside and see the same imagery in my reality as the things they were talking about on the record. From the way these guys talked to the way they carried themselves to the type of activities that they were involved in, the whole thing was a real life introspective report from the ghetto. Looking at them and sitting inside my community, it left a big toll on me because it always let me know that no matter how far I go, I gotta stay in reach of the people and what's going on in the neighborhood, whether it's a harsh reality or not.What made Eazy special was that he was telling a different type of truth, a truth that wasn't heard in music yet. Before them, rap was fun -- you had your battles and whatnot, but this time around, when it came to what Eazy wanted to do, being a visionary, he had the idea of speaking the honest truth, and I think it really resonated with a lot of people because it was the shock value of, ""Okay, these guys are really standing out and focused on telling their reality, no matter how pissed off you get by it."" And it got interest from people. People actually wanted to hear it and wanted to know what was going on.But as a kid, I really couldn't grasp the idea that the world knew about what we're going through in my neighborhood. I didn't get that idea until my debut album,, came out and that's when I truly understood how N.W.A. felt, coming from this small neighborhood but going all the way around the world and seeing these people singing these words lyric-for-lyric and understanding the trials and tribulations that are going on in the community. I understand how they feel now. It's an inspiring thing. Once I got the idea that people are actually listening, it made me want to continue making music more.Somebody told me this early on: ""You're nothing without your own backyard."" Period. If my backyard -- and my backyard being my city and my county -- doesn't believe me, then no one else will. I always remember that. I always kept that in the back of my mind and I think that's exactly what N.W.A. did, and that's why they said they want to make music for the community first, because to have that home love is like nothing else. You can go all the way across the world 10 times but when you come back to your city and see the pride and joy in these kids' faces, it's the ultimate feeling. I think that's exactly what they were thinking and it's exactly how I think today.I wouldn't be here today if it wasn't for Eazy and I wouldn't be able to say the things that I say, talk about my community the way I talk about it, for good or for bad. He's 100% influenced me in terms of really being not only honest with myself, but honest about where I come from and being proud of where I come from.And it's not just me. Artists today wouldn't be able to talk about the things they talk about if it wasn't for Eazy-E and if it wasn't for gangsta rap. Period. You don't even have to be a gangsta rapper, but the fact that you can be able to talk about your community and some of its harsh realities, that comes from none other than Eazy-E, period.Because before then, everything was pop. People were scared to talk about these kinds of tough situations, but because he and the group took it upon themselves to talk about [these things], every artist is able to and they owe it to him. He's not only the birth of gangsta rap, but he's the birth of a whole legacy of being able to say what you want",0.0,0.7409987091153328,-0.7000000000000001,-0.1
258694,False,1024,"Rules and regulations concerning examinations and cross-examinations of witnesses in civil and criminal cases. The difference in judging and in discussions between civil and criminal cases. How the members of the Sanhedrin were seated. How many recording scribes were needed. How judges were added if needed, and from what people. How witnesses should be frightened in criminal cases. The reason why Adam the first was created singly.

MISHNA I.: Cases coming before the court, be they civil or criminal, the witnesses thereof must be examined and investigated. As it is written [Lev. iv. 22]: ""One manner of judicial law shall ye have."" But what difference is there between civil and criminal cases? It is the following: (a) The former cases are to be tried by three, and the latter by twenty-three judges. (b) In the former the discussion may commence either with the accusation or with the defence, while the latter must commence with the defence and not with the accusation. (c) In the former case one voice suffices either to accuse or to acquit, and in the latter he is acquitted by one voice, while to condemn two are needed. (d) In the former the judge who proclaimed his view either to advantage or to disadvantage may, after deliberating, announce his view to the contrary. In the latter, however, he may do so only to acquit, but not to condemn. (e) In civil cases the whole body of the court may defend or accuse, while in criminal cases all of them may acquit, but the whole body must not accuse. (f) The former may be discussed in the daytime and the decision rendered at night, while in the latter the decision must be in the daytime. But if they did not come to a conclusion on the same day, they have to postpone it to the morrow. (g) The decision concerning the former may be reached on the same day either to one's advantage or to his disadvantage, while in the latter the decision may be rendered on the same day to free him, but not to condemn him until the next day; and, therefore, cases of capital punishment must not be begun on the eve of Sabbath or of a legal holiday. In civil cases, and regarding defilement and purity, they begin by asking the opinion of the eldest, while in criminal cases they begin with those who are sitting on the side.

All are qualified to judge civil cases, but not every one is qualified to judge criminal cases; as to the latter--only priests, Levites, and Israelites who may legally marry daughters of priests.

GEMARA: Are investigation and examination indeed needed in civil cases? If so, there is a contradiction from the following Tosephta: A document of which the date shows the first of Nissan in a Sabbatical year and witnesses came, saying, ""How can you testify in favor of this document--were you not with us at the same date mentioned in the document in such and such a place?"" The document as well as the witnesses are valid, as it is to be supposed that they might have written the document after the date mentioned therein. Hence if investigation and examination are needed, why should they be valid because of the above reason? Would not the investigation show if it were so or not. But according to this theory, how is to be understood the following Mishna: Promissory notes which were written at an earlier date are invalid. However, if they were written at a later date, they are. Now, if an investigation in civil cases is needed, why should that which was written at a later date be valid? (The investigation would show that the witnesses who signed the document were not present when the loan was made, as it was signed at an earlier date. Hence the loan which was made earlier is to be considered a verbal loan, which does not collect from encumbered estates, and the note should be considered a forgery?) This presents no difficulty, the objection mentioned applying more to the statement of the Boraitha, as it speaks of a Sabbatical year, in which people do not usually lend money because of the law [Deut. xv. 2] of that year, and nevertheless it makes valid that which was written in the month of Nissan, because the above-mentioned law concerning promissory notes applies only at the end of the year. However, the contradiction to our Mishna remains!

R. Hanina said: Biblically there is no difference between civil and criminal cases concerning investigations, as it reads, ""One manner of judicial law,"" etc. But why was it enacted that civil cases do not need investigation? So as not to close the door to borrowers. (And our Mishna, which states that it is needed, was taught before the enactment; and the Boraitha cited after the enactment.) But if so, let the judge who made an error in the decision of the case not be responsible? If this should be enacted",0.0,0.6789887483978134,-1.7000000000000002,0.0
257704,True,816,"As most managers are probably starting to figure out, Midfielders are the cash cows of fantasy MLS. You don't have to worry about the -4 from a goal, but you can still rack up bonus points, goals, and assists. They really can be the whole package, if you are able to pick the right ones. This was a particularly hard week for us to decide on midfielders, but we managed to decide on a few.

Big 3

Mike Magee (TOR v LA), Graham Zusi (MON vs SKC), and Sebastien Le Toux (NY vs PHI).

Keep reading for the rest.

Patrice Bernier (Montreal) vs Kansas City

Price: $8.0m

Owned by: 14.9%

Bernier could easily make out list on the Big 4, but I feel like he needs to be included. As I've been saying all week, Montreal is in excellent form and that's hard to ignore. Bernier is also on excellent personal form getting a goal and an assist over the last 2 games. Bernier also has an excellent number of recoveries (second most of any midfielder), which will continue to be a good source of bonus points for any manager who has him. If you have the funds, Bernier could be your guy. If you don't have the cash, but still want Montreal coverage, Arnaud is a slightly cheaper option, but Bernier does look better….and he takes PKs.

Diego Valeri (Portland) vs Colorado

Price: $8.0m

Owned by: 10.7%

Here's another player who has a lower ownership that I would expect, though he was quite during his last two games. Valeri is a big playmaker that likes to go on the attack for Portland and Colorado is having a rough start. These are positives for the Timbers' when they are playing away at Colorado. Perhaps the Rapids will be hoping for some more snow like hit the field last week. Perhaps he's a bit expensive, but he could be worth it.

Edgar Mejia (Chivas) vs Vancouver

Price: $7.0m

Owned by: 2.1%

On the slightly cheaper side, and I can't believe I'm saying this… we have Mejia. Chivas is doing much better than most people thought they would at this point and Mejia is in good form. He grabbed a goal and an assist last week, which brings his total assists to 2 and goals to 1. He's an attacking player, so you will not expect many defensive bonus points from him. But when he gets a chance to make good crosses and passes, he's really able to make them count. They are playing Vancouver at home this week, and te extra fan support could be just what they need to help earn them another win.

Differential

Ricardo Clark (Houston) vs San Jose

Price: $7.0m

Owned by: 5.1%

His ownership is not lower than Mejia's, but with the return of Brad Davis (who did not play a lot on International duty), he may not be getting quite as many looks. That's the reason he's listed as the differential. That aside, He has a goal and an assist to his name, has OK recovery numbers, and is currently the top point getter for Houston. He's also a lot cheaper than Davis. Perhaps it will pay off, or maybe you'll just splurge on Davis.

These are my picks, if you think there should be more names on this list, please leave a comment or come to r/FantasyMLS and comment on the post. You can also leave a message on our Facebook page. Keep checking back for more updates through the week for other positions.

257007,True,820,"The FBI recently opened beta testing of eFOIA, a new online system for filing and tracking requests for records under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). On first glance, the project seems like a noble effort to streamline transparency in an agency that is notoriously slow and resistant to releasing public information.

But there's one feature that we would like to see treated as a bug and excised from the new system: mandatory submission of government-issued identification.

Each time you want to file a FOIA request through eFOIA, you are required to upload a scan of your driver's license or other formal identification card. The FBI offers very little reasoning, except to say that it is ""So the FBI is confident in the identity of the requester."" The FBI does not explain how people's ID cards will be stored, used, or shared, except under its rather broad existing site-wide privacy policy.

To be clear: nothing in the FOIA statute requires requesters to show a government-issued ID for a standard FOIA request, and we're not sure it's even legal to ask for it. More than 20 years ago, a federal appeals court ruled that, even when a FOIA request requires a privacy waiver, the person needs only to attest under penalty of perjury that they are who they say they are.

The Department of Homeland Security's own eFOIA app, which was designed with the same intent as the FBI system, follows the court's guidance. It doesn't require ID, but if you are requesting ""Personal Records"" (for example, under the federal Privacy Act), you need to check a box declaring on penalty of perjury that all the information you've supplied is true, and then sign it electronically.

Many states, such as New Jersey and California, are very clear in their policies that you can file requests for information anonymously. Just last year, a state appeals court in Florida agreed that requiring identifying information from an anonymous requester would have a ""chilling effect on access to public records,"" under the state's Public Records Act.

Requiring photo ID will undoubtedly have a chilling effect, at least when it comes to using the FBI's new system. The public remains rightfully suspicious of an agency that has amassed information on individuals simply exercising their First Amendment rights as far back as the J. Edgar Hoover administration. Researchers, journalists, and activists may avoid the system for fear that it will result in further government scrutiny over their private lives. After all, many FOIA requests are intended to uncover controversial actions that could embarrass the FBI.

Many people who file FOIA requests use their real name, but supply the address of where they work or a P.O. Box. By demanding photo ID, the FBI is asking these people to hand over their home addresses as well, along with a photograph, and their sex, weight, height, and hair and eye color. For the purpose of processing a FOIA request, there's no reason at all that the FBI needs to know whether you need corrective lenses to drive. Of even further concern is whether the photo ID you submit may be submitted to or compared against the FBI's massive facial recognition database that we reported on in September.

It's so far unclear how this photo requirement will affect the FOIA assistance services (e.g. MuckRock, FOIA Machine, and private law firms) who file or manage requests on the behalf of others. Many could be interested in using the eFOIA interface, but that would require these organizations to solicit driver license scans from their clients, adding a whole new point in the process where sensitive information could be compromised.

The FBI should not be collecting any more information than it absolutely needs to process a request. With FOIA, it's the public who gets to ask ""papers, please,"" not the other way around.

Update December 13: Sen. Ron Wyden has sent a letter to the FBI echoing our concerns about the eFOIA system, along with questions about the photo ID will be used and stored.",0.827079545101259,0.827079545101259,0.0,0.0
255256,False,1024,"At first, when considering the possible presidential candidacies of Republicans Jeb Bush and Mitt Romney, you might think, ""How could these patrician white scions of political families be any more alike?"" When you think the word ""could,"" the tone of your voice should bend upward, like a lady in a black-and-white film from the 1950s.

So you might be surprised to find out that, in fact, there are several ways in which Bush and Romney—neither of whom have officially confirmed they are running, by the way—are actually quite different from one another. And, if they do decide to run for the Oval Office, these differences will play a major role in determining which becomes the favored choice of all the other patrician white men in the country. Because make no mistake: if the GOP voting bloc is a pie, then Bush and Romney are competing for the exact same slice.

FAMILY

As the Republican primary campaign shapes up, both Bush and Romney appear to be the legacy choices available to voters with a mind for the history of our beautiful, bizarre nation. The legacies they represent, though, differ significantly. Mitt's father, George, was elected governor in Michigan three times, by increasingly large margins. That's an improvement on Mitt, who gave up on being governor of Massachusetts after just one term. He left office in 2007 to focus on the first of his (so far) two unsuccessful presidential bids.

On the presidential level, Romney made it further than his old man. Though Mitt and George share the same number of failed White House runs, George never won the Republican nomination. He briefly challenged Barry Goldwater in the 1964 primary before withdrawing, then got thrashed by Nixon in 1968, after attributing his previous support for the Vietnam War to ""brainwashing.""

Jeb's family looks a little different. Aside from his father's 1992 re-election campaign, the Bush men have dominated their attempts to hold elected office, both as governors and presidents, a stark contrast with the Romneys. If there's a more dynastic family in the United States than the Bush clan, there are being very quiet about it.

RELIGION

As you know—and if you don't, congratulations on just learning how to walk—Mitt Romney is a Mormon. This does appear to have played a role in voters' conceptions of him; a Pew research poll in 2011 said a remarkable one out of four voters would be less likely to vote for a Mormon candidate.

Although you might assume that, like his older brother W., Jeb is a card-carrying evangelical booster, that isn't true. He's actually a Catholic, having converted to his wife's religion two decades ago. This could come in handy appealing to Hispanics, a demo that Republicans have had their eye on for a while, and it will also likely increase his appeal with the evangelical cohort that tends to make up a large percentage of Republican voters. Because Jeb's Catholicism hasn't hurt his social-conservative bonafides—as governor of Florida, he opposed stem-cell research and abortion rights, and famously stepped in to intervene in the 2003 Terri Schiavo case—all of which will make him an acceptable candidate for the far right, even if he isn't Mike Huckabee or Rick Santorum.

CONSERVATIVE BONAFIDES

On that note, the big question for both Bush and Romney is whether either is conservative enough to win the Republican nomination. Twice previously, Romney has proven he can twist and warp himself to be palatable enough for his party's conservative base, but not without serious effort and grumbling from the right-wing. In 2008, the man who'd brought socialized healthcare to Massachusetts ran as the party's conservative option, suggesting that he had switched sides on both abortion rights and healthcare, and that he had also championed the war in Iraq. As the Atlantic's David Graham points out, Romney knew he couldn't get to the right of the Tea Party in 2012, so he, focusing on a promise to turn around the country's economy. Graham suggests that Romney's ID in 2016 will be ""Compassionate Conservative Champion of the Poor,"" which, considering his 47 percent speech in 2012, is sort of like Ted Turner going vegetarian.

Meanwhile, Bush's positions on social issues may be party-approved, but he has two huge red flags to address. The first is his position on immigration reform, a stance that has become more progressive since leaving the governor's office, particularly in his support for a ""pathway to citizenship"" for undocumented immigrants. The second is his championing of the Common Core education system, which conservatives hate. Like really, really hate. Nate Silver claims this won't be as big a deal as we might think, but the Breitbarts of the world beg to differ, and if Bush is going to carry his support into the nomination, he'll need to talk the GOP into it.

But this is also true with most all digital pianos that allow you to connect to an external device with a USB/MIDI cable. Also the Roland FP25 includes the normally optional furniture style stand and triple pedal-bar whereas the FP30 does not. You would need to purchase those accessories at an extra cost which would bring the price of the FP30 with stand, pedals, & headphones (the headphones are basic cheap headphones) above $799.

256559,True,799,"Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor has sought to downplay her eyebrow-raising pledge that she would resign as chief executive if the mainstream view was against her, as her campaign team mulls a strategy shift before she returns to debate mode on Sunday.

In a bid to clarify her unexpected remarks the night before during a televised debate with two other chief executive candidates, the former chief secretary on Wednesday tried to draw a distinction between ""mainstream opinion"" and ""personal popularity ratings"".

Lam said she would take into account mainstream opinion if elected to the city's top post on March 26, rather than fluctuating popularity ratings.

""I was not talking about personal popularity ratings,"" she said. ""They go up and down.""

""Just in case, if there is one single issue where the mainstream view of the Hong Kong people is contradictory to the faithful and truthful execution of the Basic Law, then the chief executive, in my view, should resign,"" Lam told the media.

""[That's] because he or she would not be able to discharge that constitutional function enshrined in the Basic Law while respecting the mainstream view of the people.""

She however sidestepped questions on whether she would quit if confronted with huge protests from the drafting of the controversial national security legislation.

Meanwhile Lam's arch rival in the race, former financial ­secretary John Tsang Chun-wah, has widened his lead over her to more than 17 percentage points, according to the latest survey commissioned by the South China Morning Post.

On Tuesday, Lam was asked by an audience at the debate what she would do if the views of Hongkongers differed from hers. Lam had said she would resign if ""mainstream opinion made me no longer able to continue the job as chief executive"".

On Wednesday, Tsang expressed doubts over her clarification of the remark. ""She is sometimes talking about resigning, and sometimes talking about not resigning. This is rather negative, because one should persevere even in the most difficult of circumstances,"" he said.

A member of her campaign team, reviewing her performance on Tuesday, said she could be more articulate in Sunday's debate – the last chance for the candidates to cross swords.

""She should relax her pace and spend more time elaborating her governance visions and policies,"" he said.

Some 1,194 members of the Election Committee will choose the next chief executive from three candidates – Lam, Tsang and retired judge Woo Kwok-hing – on March 26.

Lam's clarification came after another verbal stumble last weekend when she was slammed for likening online comments critical of her and her supporters to ""white terror"".

Former security minister Ambrose Lee Siu-kwong, now a local deputy to the National People's Congress, said he did not watch the debate, but he took the chance to take a swipe at Tsang.

Lam had named supporter and popular actress Josephine Siao – who has a hearing disability – as a victim of ""white terror"", but Tsang had argued that ""online comments are not white terror"", adding freedom of speech was one of the city's core values.

Lee said of Tsang's retort: ""I am very unhappy to see [him] tolerate cyberbullying of a disabled actress who is well respected by Hongkongers."" Lee had also earlier indicated his preference for Lam.

Daniel Grayson is the associate director of undergraduate admissions at Tufts University in Medford, Mass.

The task, as colleges and universities around the country have assigned it, is to describe yourself in 500 words or less. Sum up all of who you are — your aspirations, perspective, strengths, intellect, personality, all of it — in one page, single spaced.

Hit the panic button.

You know what I do when faced with a problem? I ask the Internet. So do a Google search — I dare you — for the phrase ""admissions essay advice"" and see the mess you get.

One list on a prominent Web site includes the following suggestions (in order, with some paraphrasing): be cautious and then, immediately afterward, be controversial.

O.K. Got it: Say something risky without taking chances. That's not helpful.

Neither is the advice you get from most admissions officers when you ask them.

""Just be yourself,"" they say. Is there an alternative to that? Were you supposed to lie and pretend to be your smarter and more interesting older brother?


Here are your deceptively complicated essay goals, as I see them:

Show us how you think.

Tell us what matters to you.

I'm not going to sugarcoat this: That is a really difficult task. It demands that you understand yourself in a way that perhaps no one has ever asked of you. It demands that you ask yourself questions perhaps no teacher has ever asked. Questions like:

What invigorates/inspires/angers me?

What do I wish we talked or learned about in school?

What are my most strongly held opinions and where do they come from?

What are the differences between how I see myself and how others see me?

What pieces of my life transform my thinking (whether I want them to or not)?

What ideas fire me up just when everyone else is cooling down?

These aren't easy questions. They are dangerous questions. They are questions with teeth, questions that require you to stake out a position, to have an opinion and to express something of substance.

You don't need to literally answer one of those questions to write a good admissions essay (though you could); think of the list as a set of examples.

Being honest and forceful about yourself may make some adults around you nervous; it's not ""safe."" They will worry that you are being too controversial or informal. You should listen carefully and try to see your writing from their perspective. But you should feel comfortable ignoring advice that does not feel right.

If you are not interested in thinking about the big issues (or the small ones) around community service, here is some radical advice: Don't write about it.

If you love your sport, but it isn't what you are itching to talk about when you get out of bed, don't write about it.

Writing about service or determination reflects important qualities, but no one in our applicant pools writes about how quickly they quit or how much they hate helping society. If you write the ""safe"" essay, how will you stand apart?

I wrote of your goals, now here is ours: to build the most interesting and intellectually diverse class we can. We want to fill our seats with students who have things to say, who will challenge conventions and advance conversations, who will learn from each other.

The answers to those dangerous questions define who you are. They reflect what you value and how you think, as well as how you will enhance our community and classrooms. You need to be confident and proud enough to stand behind those ideas because if you won't, why would an admissions officer choose to stand behind you?

As a reader, I want to be in your corner, to fight for your cause in a hypercompetitive applicant pool. Can you fit all of who you are into 500 words? Of course not, but you can pick out a couple of important pieces.

Tell me what matters, and give me a reason to fight.",0.30537317817409826,0.8053731781740983,-0.4,-0.1
257448,False,1024,"Danny Boyle's 2000 film 'The Beach' makes for interesting viewing from  a Nationalist perspective because whether he intended his movie to be so or not, it's the story of the failure of liberal minded Europeans to face reality while attempting to create utopia. It's a brilliant meditation on liberal denial.  The Beach also serves as something of a nostalgia fest for those of us born at the tail end of 'Generation X' and that includes Leonardo DiCaprio, the main star of The Beach.  Set just before 9,11 and before beheading Europeans wherever they could be found outside of the West became a trend, The Beach harks back to a time when middle class 'Gen Xers' could trot around the world in search of the 'authentic', away from the consumerist tedium of high capitalism which had reduced their own cultures to shopping malls and warehouse space.   Enlightenment and spiritual fulfilment, they believed, was to be found within the jungles of India, the beaches of Thailand or the ruined Archaeology of central American native tribes rather than the pay as you go Cathedrals of Europe or the beer belly and tattoo'd idiocy of the Spanish resort. DiCaprio's 'Richard' fits perfectly into the stereotype of the early 20's white middle class male in search of something more, something ''off the beaten track'' and after some rather tedious plot points and story arcs he finds it, an island, a whole community of white middle class liberal types just like himself.  This, then, is the central pitch of Boyle's film, based on a novel by Alex Garland, The Beach is actually a lagoon on a remote island off Thailand where a small, secretive community of European backpackers, and a token black male, have set out to create their very own paradise on earth.  Upon arrival with a young French couple he picked up along the way, Richard informs us via a voice over that the island did not have ''an ideology or shit like that'', the community on the island has no work ethic, no real moral code, no religion, no laws and no real compulsion to do anything accept smoke dope, have sex and sunbathe. 
 However, the island actually does have an ideology, it is unbridled hedonism. The island is viewed upon as a paradise by these middle class whites because there's literally nothing to do except 'have fun' to lounge around in their garden of Eden untroubled by work, taxes, family or the monotonous daily grind of keeping the hyper capitalist engine of the West ticking over.  The community was founded by the slightly older, slightly more upper class 'Sal' played by ice queen Tilda Swinton, yes, the island community is a matriarchy too. Sal seems to spend all of her time in hippy garb lounging on a raised sofa, eyeing the island community as a spider watches out from its web, any signs that somebody is not suitably euphoric, stoned, cheerful or sexually satisfied and she's alerted to the tremble. And it's here we begin to see where the flaws of this way of life appear, if you've set about creating a perfect society, where happiness is guaranteed and is the primary purpose of the community existing, then the threats to this society come from people not being in a permanent state of bliss. The Beach gives us a fascinating glimpse into the mind of the liberal European and their utter incapability of even trying to process that the way they're doing things might be monumentally wrong.  The first glimpse we get that things may not be 'perfect' is when a young man explains that sometimes it's hard to catch fish, and all they have to eat is bags of rice, they have sun and sex and beach sports, but they're going hungry. Another hint comes when Richard takes a rare trip to the mainland for supplies and is overwhelmed by the girls asking for tampons to be brought back. Sal is obsessed with keeping the island a secret lest the Pepsi swigging slobs of the white tourist masses come along to trample and fart all over her dream. This means no help can ever come from outside...ever.  Conditions on the island gradually deteriorate but nobody can ever admit to it, the party cannot stop, so when three Swedish brothers are savaged by a shark while fishing they have a problem. Nature, reality, has a way of wriggling into any wonderland man (or woman), can create, sometimes it's a Muslim terrorist, sometimes it's a shark.  One of the Swedish brothers recovers, one dies immediately, it's the third brother who poses the problem, as DiCaprio's Richard explains ''You have to get better or die, it's the bit in-between which pisses people off'' and indeed, having a man writhe around howling in agony proves to be a major downer, a real drag man!.

258791,True,996,"The Maldives Takes Its Place in Indian Ocean Geopolitics

In April, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi hosted Maldivian President Abdulla Yameen in New Delhi, where they inked six agreements, including one on defense cooperation. A year earlier, Modi had cancelled a Maldives visit amid political chaos there. But India has reinitiated engagement with the archipelago, prompted by its new China-oriented trajectory. This demonstrates that small nations like the Maldives are in a position to benefit from India-China competition.

India's new Maldives approach comes at a time in which maritime trade is becoming increasingly important for both India and China. China almost doubled its reliance upon imports to satisfy its oil needs between 2000 and 2014, while India's dependence on oil imports jumped from 43 percent to 71 percent between 1990 and 2012. A substantial proportion of these imports travel along Indian Ocean trade routes. In addition, nearly one third of Chinese maritime commerce and the bulk of Indian trade involves Indian Ocean shipping.

China's strategic interests and logistical limitations in the Indian Ocean have prompted the country to increase its presence in the region. For example, the country has begun using anti-piracy missions to expand regular naval activity. China is also reaching out to the Indian Ocean region through the ""One Belt, One Road"" project, which is premised on the idea of common development.

China's efforts in the Indian Ocean have at times sparked tension with India. A 2014 Chinese submarine visits to Sri Lanka and other spots in the Indian Ocean infuriated New Delhi, while the Indian press received with skepticism China's Djibouti outpost, the first Chinese naval facility on foreign soil. In order to respond to heightened Chinese involvement in the region, India has initiated a proactive naval posture.

Both China and India rely on safe trade routes crossing the Indian Ocean, so both countries aim to boost their clout in the area. The Maldives plays a key role in this geopolitical competition. The archipelago is adjacent to the main regional shipping routes, making it an important Indian Ocean toehold.

China has sought to enhance its relationship with the Maldives through cooperation on infrastructure development and tourism. During Xi Jinping's 2014 visit, the two countries discussed prospective projects such as the ""China-Maldives Friendship Bridge,"" a $210 million initiative, funded chiefly by Beijing. In 2014, 360,000 Chinese tourists traveled to the Maldives, constituting more than 30 percent of all visitors to the country.

India's engagement with the Maldives features collaboration in various fields, including healthcare, military affairs, and infrastructure. Indian aid to the Maldives surged from $4 million in 2014 to $30 million in 2015 and 2016. This cooperation may further improve under Prime Minister Narendra Modi's ""Neighborhood First"" policy, which prioritizes close ties to proximate countries.

Political instability in the Maldives has limited India's effort to engage the country. When Maldivian President Abdulla Yameen initiated a crackdown on his political adversaries in February 2015 and imprisoned pro-India former President Mohamed Nasheed, a worried Modi called off his March 2015 trip to the archipelago.

Despite these limitation, the Maldives' strategic location has encouraged India to continue its efforts to engage. In July 2015, the Maldives amended its constitution to allow foreign ownership of land, sparking Indian fears that China would try to develop ""strategic assets"" in the archipelago. Both China and the Maldives denied this, but the constitutional change nonetheless prompted India to revisit its relationship to the country. Indian External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj took a trip to the Maldives just after the amendment came into force.

India remains cautious, however, about trying to play a role in sorting out the political chaos in the Maldives. The growing Chinese presence in the Indian Ocean enables the Maldives to capitalize on the ""China card"" to limit India's options by raising the possibility that Indian withdrawal or criticism will encourage the archipelago to tilt towards China. Additionally, while Modi's ""Neighborhood First"" policy and Indian Ocean tour suggest that the security and common economic development of the region are high priorities for India, Maldivian President Yameen has made clear his view that foreign powers should keep out of the archipelago's internal politics. Engaging in a dispute with the Maldives over domestic issues would have severely degraded the prospects of Modi's fledgling Indian Ocean diplomacy.

For its part, the Maldives benefits from its ability to balance between China and India, turning their geopolitical competition into engagement and aid. By moving closer to China, Yameen impelled India to overcome its grievances tied to Maldivian domestic politics, demonstrating the country's ability to use geopolitical competition in the Indian Ocean to its advantage.

258917,True,555,"Sea of cobwebs captured on Victorian farm in ballooning phenomenon

Updated

Spiders have begun falling from the sky in south-western Victoria, as cooler conditions make way for a phenomenon known as ballooning.

The spiders sought out higher ground after wet weather, spinning a sea of cobwebs that covered the ground on a dairy farm in Gorae West, outside Portland, earlier this week.

In a similar occurrence, millions of spiders invaded farmland in the New South Wales Southern Tablelands last month.

McLean View Dairy director Nathan McLean said spider silk covered the property.

When the tension in the air is strong enough the spider simply lets go and they get carried along in the breeze until they either drop the line and fall to the ground or the breeze drops. Martyn Robinson, Australian Museum

""You ride across the paddock through the webs on a four-wheeler and even though it looks like it's on the ground you'll get spider webs around head height,"" he said.

""We tend to see it a lot in late autumn, early winter.""

Australian Museum naturalist Martyn Robinson said it was common for the spiders to seek higher ground during the onset of cooler temperatures and heavy rain.

""The baby spiders will climb to the top of the nearest tall object, they stick their abdomens in the air and they release silk,"" he said.

""When the tension in the air is strong enough the spider simply lets go, and they get carried along in the breeze until they either drop the line and fall to the ground or the breeze drops.

""They can travel along in that way for kilometres – they have devices like a hoover powered by a battery – and they haul themselves up like a hot air balloon.

""People have caught baby spiders up to three kilometres off the ground.""

Mr Robinson said early winter provided the optimal conditions for viewing the phenomenon.

""You'll get a lot of spiders hatching out in the early May and June period, and then you'll get the fogs and mists and things forming, so that combination means it will be fairly regular,"" he said.

""It's a fairly common technique for baby spiders ... and also ground-dwelling spiders.

""It's no coincidence that spiders are some of the first colonisers of new islands, because they can just drift along so effortlessly and snag lines on new volcanic islands that have risen up in the past couple of years.""

El-Hadji Diouf has reignited his war of words with Steven Gerrard, following the Liverpool legend's retirement on Thursday, declaring: ""He was nothing"".

Ex-England international Gerrard, now 36, called time on his illustrious playing career, following his 18-month sojourn with LA Galaxy.

Tributes have poured in to the Anfield icon, who led the Reds to their fifth European Cup success in 2005.

However, Diouf has not joined those hailing Gerrard, a player he has previously called an 'egotist' and accused of racism.

The pair spent two years as teammates at Anfield following Diouf's £10million arrival in June 2002, signed by Gerard Houllier, but Diouf struggled on Merseyside and Gerrard wrote in his 2015 autobiography that the Senegalese ""did not care about football and about Liverpool.""

(Image: SFR Sport)

Diouf, now 35, speaking on French television, has now declared that ""the man, I do not respect.""

He told French TV channel SFR Sport: ""People told me at Liverpool, there was some guys you could not touch, but I touched them. That is why it was complicated for me.""

Former Arsenal midfielder Emmanuel Petit, alongside Diouf on TV show 'La Vestiare' questions: ""Are you talking about Steven Gerrard?""

Diouf responded: ""I do. Stevie G and Jamie Carragher, the two scousers.""

Asked about Gerrard's autobiography comment, Diouf responded: ""He was right, I am not a scouser. I did not come to Liverpool to buy a house and live there in the future.""

Then, he advances his criticism of the ex-Liverpool skipper.

""When I arrived I showed him he was nothing at all,"" said Diouf. ""He was nothing at all.

""I asked him to tell me in which big competition, Euros or World Cup, people think about him.""

As World Cup winner Petit struggled to recall Liverpool's 2005 Champions League success, Diouf exclaimed: ""Here is the proof, even you cannot remember.

""You are talking about Euros and World Cup. Today I owe you respect [Petit], I owe respect to Mr Zidane because you did win the World Cup.""

(Image: Getty Images)

(Image: Getty Images)

Petit fires back, hailing Gerrard as ""an immense player"", but Diouf counters, declaring that his issues with Gerrard are with the man, not Gerrard the player.

""I repeat. I respect the player, very big player, but the man, I do not respect. And I told him, I let him know that.

""With all my respect I let him know. For me in Liverpool, he was not just a player like anyone else. He had to work and play his football as I had to work and play my football.

""Then as you know, there were some brown-nosers, who went to the manager to repeat what I said. That was the real problem. When Gerrard did that, we had an argument, like real men.

""That is why he does not like me. He knows I say what I think, that when it is not right, no problem, I am up for it.

""He could not, he was afraid of looking into my eyes. He was afraid of talking to me. Let's not forget when I arrived I did not ask for his shirt. He asked for my Senegal shirt for one of his mates.""

(Image: CW PicDesk)

Diouf also revealed that he owes a debt of gratitude to his former Lens coach Roland Courbis, who convinced Gerard Houllier to take a chance on the Senegalese forward.

""If I signed to Liverpool, it is thanks to him. I had not played the World Cup or AFCON [African Cup of Nations] yet.

""Roland said to Gerard, 'there is a kid you could be interested in, sign him, sign El Hadji Diouf.

""Gerard came to see me in Lens, to talk to me, and then I started to dream.""",0.0,0.7068980685094537,-2.5,-0.1

Torres, 33, elected to become a free agent Monday after the Mets designated him for assignment.

The Yankees make sense as a possible landing spot for the California native and six-year veteran.

Completed in 2008, the Global Seed Vault is a remote archive for safeguarding seeds for thousands of crop varieties. If anything dramatic should happen elsewhere around the world, we want these seeds to be there.

The vault consists of a giant freezer room bored into a mountain, protected by the bedrock around it and the permafrost above it. But according to a report in The Guardian, the vault experienced an unhappy surprise recently—melting permafrost in winter.

The Arctic just experienced its second-warmest winter on record (surpassed only by 2016), and Svalbard saw remarkable temperatures and even rain. In fact, Svalbard averaged more than 4 °C above even the 2004-2013 average.

As a result, meltwater trickled into the seed vault's entrance tunnel before refreezing. The freezer room itself was safe, but the ice in the tunnel had to be chipped out. Hege Njaa Aschim, a spokesperson for the Norwegian government, told The Guardian, ""It was supposed to [operate] without the help of humans, but now we are watching the seed vault 24 hours a day.""

Whether or not these conditions become common as the Arctic warms, precautions are being taken to avoid a repeat of this event. Precautions include waterproofing improvements for the entrance tunnel and drainage channels to divert meltwater. It might take a little more than sticking a freezer inside an Arctic mountain to keep these seeds cold and safe, it seems.",0.8115156326315183,0.8115156326315183,0.0,0.0

Published 6:36 PM, September 20, 2015

The fine, white sand beaches, cerulean waters and stunning landscapes of popular destinations such as Boracay, Bohol, and Cebu are usually on everyone's travel lists year-round. These provinces have all the facilities, high-end resorts, world-class restaurants and readily available transport to take you wherever you want to go.

But there are many more places in the Philippines to satiate a traveler's thirst for adventure. Here are just a few:

Lake Sebu

The long trip to Lake Sebu will reward you with fresh air, the sight of verdant forests and mountains, and the Seven Falls. (READ: Mornings made better at Lake Sebu)

The seven falls are Hikong Alo, Hikong Bente, Hikong B'Lebel, Hikong Ukol, Hikong Tonok, and Hikong K'Fo-I, all of which arehidden in the forest. Adventurous and outdoorsy travelers will enjoy a trek to get to each one. (READ: 9 spectacular places to visit in Mindanao)

If you don't want to tire yourself trekking, Lake Sebu is home to one of the longest zip lines in the region. Measuring 740m long, fly over the mountains and get a glimpse of Hikong Bente, Hikong K'Fo-I, and Hikong Lowig as you glide through the air for approximately a minute. (READ: Hit the road: Cool off at these 5 PH waterfalls)

The second zip line measures 420m long and lets you scream your lungs out and imitate Superman for around 30 seconds. (READ: IN PHOTOS: 8 PH lakes to add to your travel bucket list)

For those who want to relax after an adventurous day, Lake Sebu boasts landscapes of mountains and picturesque lakes with blooming lotuses. The many resorts and guesthouses provide different views of the lakes; rent a kayak for P25 or book a lake cruise with cultural show and lunch for P200.

The Tbolis or dream weavers call Lake Sebu home; they weave patterns using sap and wood to produce the iconic effect seen in their different handmade products.

How to get to Lake Sebu: There are direct flights from Manila to General Santos City. Upon arrival, head to Bulaong Bus Terminal and ride bus bound for Marbel, the fare is P83 one-way. Once at the terminal, get on a van that travel to Surallah for P20 one-way.

Once you arrive at Surallah, ride a van bound for Lake Sebu for P35 one-way. Once at Lake Sebu, hire a habal-habal or motorcycle for P50 to take you to your chosen accommodation.

Quirino

Heading north will typically take you to places like Baguio, Ilocos, Sagada and Banaue, and this landlocked province in the mountains has plenty of adventures in store for those who visit.

The towering rock formations, formed by the push and pull of nature with its curves, sudden drops and ascents, flank the Siitan River where visitors can go tubing.

After riding down the river, jump off a 15-feet high cliff to cap off the day.

The sweeping view of the rise and fall of hills, mountains and rock formations as the sun sets on Landingan Viewpoint make the ride through the labyrinthine roads worthwhile.

The Aglipay Caves have 37 chambers, 8 of which are open for tourists. The walk, crawl and slithering through widening and narrowing walkways are part of the adventure. Get ready to get dirty, as you have to use your hands, sit down and bend to get through muddy surroundings.

This subterranean adventure will reveal rock formations that take on various shapes; only your imagination will limit what you see.

Quirino is the destination for travelers looking for adventure, with the many caves, rivers and cliffs this province is ideal for eco-tourism.

How to get to Quirino: Bus companies such as GV Florida, Five Star and Northern Luzon Bus Line travel from Metro Manila to Quirino for approximately P500 one-way.

Once in Quirino, it is best to rent a jeep for P1500 for the whole day to visit the many attractions. There is a P250 fee for tubing, P25 entrance fee for the cave and a P500 guide fee.

Even the defending champs have some questions that need answering.

The Chicago Cubs have as much talent as any team in baseball; however, the coaching staff needs to decide who will fill the final spots on the bench and in the bullpen.

If there's one area that could turn into a compelling position battle, it's the No. 5 starter spot. An injury-plagued veteran with major upside, a standout reliever and a top prospect-turned-reclamation project are among the options.

Then there's the matter of discussing a potential extension with All-Star starter Jake Arrieta.

With pitchers and catchers set to begin reporting in a matter of days, here's an in-depth look at the five key questions the Cubs will need to answer this spring.",0.6629784397599805,0.6629784397599805,0.0,0.0

i really fell in love with the unembellished simplicity and modesty of the no jive from the first throw. and since then i've worked on and off to put my own stamp on it (both metaphorically and now, physically). i've tried to hit some hard stuff on it. i've tried to come up with some new moves that work BECAUSE of its limitations, rather than in spite of them. and i've accumulated a pretty staggering collection of no jive variations (my wife would probably call it pathological). this one makes 75. for anyone who gets excited about yo-yoing, there will have been that one model which you just see as ""classic"". typically, it'll be one of the first models of which you were aware - maybe the imperial you first saw at toys r us or the dark magic you saw in the video which first got you hooked. regardless of its specifics, it becomes the central icon around which you build an understanding of what yo-yo's are and what they are for. that's how i feel about the no jive. though it wasn't the first i owned, i think of it as the penultimate ""simple"" yo-yo; the best thing we collectively came up with before yo-yo's (and yo-yoing) got complicated. mind you, i have no problem with complicated - some of my tricks are pretty complicated. but i've always had this need to stay tethered (so to speak) to the idea that yo-yo's are basically toys - meant for fun. rancid milk is genius in its obfuscating angular geometry, but so is shoot the moon in its carefree simplicity. when i learned that i could go ahead with the idea to make a small run of personalized no jives, i really wanted it to be something that would fit with what i loved about the yo-yo from the start. in 2012 i did a video i called ""play simply"" to commemorate the end of my year of playing only the spyy ""eh"", the title of which was adapted from the patagonia slogan ""live simply"" (patagonia was cool with it and even threw the video up on their website). i used to have an aikido instructor who insisted that ""simple doesn't mean easy"". at the time, the distinction was lost on me, but now that i'm older i come back to it often. alot of the hardest things i've ever done (with yo-yo's or without) have been fundamentally simple and clear. there isn't really too much technique involved in dropping into a bowl or overhead wave, playing through a lead sheet, or blasting through an attack with irimi-nage. with each of those, the key is to commit and be present. 360 flips are great, but i've met a lot of guys who have have them dialed and won't drop in on 8ft. similarly, would anyone argue that charlie parker's ""ornithology"" more meaningful than miles' ""flamenco sketches"" because it's got more notes? with love to bird (who could also play slow, i know), sometimes i wonder whether the function of complex technicality is to distract from the fact that we're conditioned not to see the value in the simple stuff. it shouldn't be surprising. our culture is imbued with the olympian mentality of ""faster, higher, stronger"" (by which we've really just come to mean ""more""). and though that attitude has taken us to the moon and bought us many wonderful appliances, we've paid for it with, among other things, sunsets devoid of contrails and the time necessary to appreciate them. this past xmas, my dad gave me a cool little gift - a wooden yo-yo from yosemite featuring an engraved image of the park icon ""half-dome"". yosemite has got to be my folks' favorite place under the sun, and the yo-yo was given to suggest it as a destination for an upcoming family trip. personally, i just really liked the natural scene on a wooden yo-yo, and a week or two later i had a vague",0.557269509141478,0.657269509141478,-0.1,0.0
258858,True,646,"In newly filed campaign disclosure forms, President Donald Trump's 2020 presidential campaign committee has revealed that it paid a $50,000 retainer to criminal defense attorney Alan S. Futerfas who represents the president's son Donald Trump Jr. The timing of the payment is certainly raising eyebrows. Trump claimed he found out about the controversial meeting his son held with a Kremlin-linked lawyer around the time the New York Times first reported it, but the payment to Trump Jr.'s lawyer was made eleven days before.

According to the disclosure forms, Trump's presidential campaign made a $50,000 payment to Futerfas' law firm on June 27, 2017. The first story about Trump Jr.'s meeting with lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya went up on the New York Times website on July 8, 2017, 11 days after the payment was made. On July 12, in an exchange with reporters on Air Force One en route to Paris, Trump said, ""I only heard about it [Trump Jr's meeting with the Russian lawyer] two or three days ago.""

A report from Yahoo News this week revealed that Trump's lawyers knew about the email chain between Trump Jr. and music publicist Rob Goldstone for weeks. According to the Yahoo News report, Trump's lead attorney, Marc Kasowitz and Alan Garten, general counsel of the Trump organization, found out about the now infamous email exchange the third week of June. The payment from Trump's committee was made the fourth week of June.

Trump is known to be careful with spending, monitoring expenses closely and grousing when too much money is spent. The fact that a $50,000 payment, to a criminal defense attorney that represents his son on a matter related to the Russia investigation, could be made by a campaign committee he controls without his knowledge would certainly be surprising according to two sources familiar with Trump's oversight of campaign expenses.

A spokesman for Trump's campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment.


The use of campaign funds to pay for Trump Jr.'s personal legal bills is also eyebrow raising. President Trump claims he is worth $10 billion dollars (Bloomberg News says he is worth $2.86 billion and Forbes says he is worth $3.5 billion). A majority of Trump's campaign donations come from low-dollar donors, the type that give less than $100. That a family worth billions is using campaign committee funds to pay personal legal bills is not something that is likely to go over well with Trump's base in the long-run.

The expenditure appears to be legal though. Lawrence Noble, who served as general counsel of the Federal Elections Commission and currently serves as general counsel of the Campaign Legal Center told HuffPost if Futerfas' representation of Trump Jr. is strictly related to matters pertaining to the presidential campaign then it is permissible to pay him from the campaign committee.

But if the investigation turns to noncampaign matters, as some have speculated it might given that special counsel Robert Mueller has broad investigative powers, it would not be legal for the Trump campaign to cover Trump Jr.'s legal bills.

255273,False,1024,"As the Internet and its younger retarded brother, the social media, slowly enter the deep-end of the pool together, the frequency of 'morally grey situations' starts increasing.

This is only natural—for those that know technology (the users of the Internet) cannot see beyond it, and those who do not know technology (the users of social media) cannot see into it.

So when Sagarika Ghose is bad-mouthed on Twitter and the BBC >covers it with an article titled: ""Why are Indian women being attacked on social media?"", we should refrain from jumping to certain conclusions.

Conclusions like Ms. Ghose's assumption that women abused on Twitter tend to be 'liberal and secular' or that her online abusers must be angry at 'women who speak their mind.' Or even (a BBC-drawn conclusion) that the Indian patriarchal mentality is 'carrying over to the Internet.'

While the above statements may be justified, and even correct, the broader aspect of online abuse cannot be as simple as that. It is at, its heart, a clash of civilisations. A battle royale between netizens and the Twitterati.

From 1995 to nearly 2005 – 2006, the Internet encouraged free discussion of even the most taboo topics—as in most forums, people were able to wrap a cloak of anonymity around themselves. During this period there was no Facebook, no Twitter. Before the advent of social media and its ilk, a person's online identity could not possibly represent the whole of a person's actual identity! This was because for the most part, people functioned on the Internet under some nickname or the other.

Indeed, many of the Internet's earliest communities (IRC, various bulletin board messaging systems etc) were built in such a manner that an individual's personal identity played no role in the functioning of these forums. Indeed, a derivative of this principle was that users were actually discouraged to shed parts of their personal identity to be able to function on these forums. Why was this , you ask? For the simple reason that there was no way to verify ones identity, even if you wanted to reveal it!

Rubber ducky

This indirectly led to a different definition of identity itself. You could be Indian, Chinese, American, Russian, gay, straight, male, female—all depending merely on what you fancied on being that day. In fact, this phenomenon became so prevalent; the founder of 4Chan put a word to it. He called it 'fluid identity'. Moving from being one person to the other, nobody could stop you.

These principles were embraced, which lead to slurs like f***er, w**re, s**t becoming commonplace. Why? Because the Internet initially, was at its essence, home to basically an anonymous pool of people from around the world.

And when you call somebody a w**re, what you are essentially doing is reducing their identity down to the most simplest level. It was commonly assumed that everybody would lie about who they were, and by slandering everyone with an insult, they could move discussion forward from there onwards.

Almost how in certain tribal groups, when a boy becomes a man, he is given a new name and then only allowed to lead his life. Similarly, bringing your own ethnicity or political affiliation or orientation of any form to the Internet was simply not necessary - as the Internet would remove it anyway. In some forums, it was considered almost rude to draw attention to yourself in that fashion.

And this is what people, who take offense to online abuse, are truly missing. You see that blue, ostentatious check mark symbol next to Sagarika Ghose's Twitter handle?

The Twitterati and Facebook personalities who embrace the confirmation of their own real-world identities—and indeed broadcast to the whole Internet that ""yes, this is the true Sagarika Ghose"" are trying to bring the physical world's notion of identity onto the Internet. And this is where our problem starts.

Political scientist Samuel Huntington gained prominence for his theory—t >he Clash of Civilisations— where he postulated that all sources of conflicts in the future would not be ideological, but rather cultural in nature.

Identity mismatch

And do we not see this happening, twenty years later, on the Internet? On the one hand you have the old users of the Internet with notions of fluid identity, and on the other hand you have social media users who wish to reclaim their right to be offended! It is a clash between users of websites with different identifying natures, with different cultures. The point here is that, for users of the old Internet, it is not just Sagarika Ghose who is a s**t, but in that everybody is a s**t.

What would be ideal at this point, however, is for both camps to understand each other's stance and together develop a new concept of online identity",0.4975963748152547,0.6975963748152547,-0.2,0.0
255045,False,1024,"Former New Mexico Governor Discusses His Role In Otto Warmbier Negotiations

NPR's Kelly McEvers talks with former New Mexico governor Bill Richardson on the death of American college student Otto Warmbier, who returned from North Korea in a coma last week.

KELLY MCEVERS, HOST:

The Hamilton County Coroner's Office in Cincinnati is investigating the death of Otto Warmbier. A public funeral is planned for Thursday. The 22-year-old died yesterday less than a week after being returned to Ohio from North Korea in a coma. Doctors at the University of Cincinnati Medical Center described his condition as a state of unresponsive wakefulness. President Trump talked about Warmbier's death today.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: It's a total disgrace what happened to Otto. That should never ever be allowed to happen. And frankly, if he were brought home sooner, I think the result would have been a lot different.

MCEVERS: One of the people who had been working to get Warmbier released sooner is former New Mexico Governor Bill Richardson. His foundation, the Richardson Center, helps negotiate the release of political prisoners. Richardson started working on the case just after Warmbier was detained in January 2016, and he says he had a lot of meetings with North Korean officials.

BILL RICHARDSON: I've talked to him a total myself and my chief of staff 20 times in New York. My executive director, Mickey Bergman, went to North Korea at the end of the year with the support of the Obama administration. We offered private humanitarian aid. North Koreans never responded. They never said yes or no. They never agreed to have me visit as I have in the past - a total mystery but obviously a real cover-up.

MCEVERS: What do you think happened?

RICHARDSON: What I think happened is that the North Koreans engaged in some kind of interrogation, and the interrogation went wrong, that it affected his brain, that he then went into a coma. I don't think they're foolish enough to engage and torture a 21-year-old boy who just stole a political banner. Yeah, he's a bargaining chip, but there's no reason why he might have been tortured.

But with the North Koreans in the past, you could get prisoners out in exchange for high-level visits, humanitarian assistance. With Kim Jong Un, the leader of North Korea now, we could make a deal with his father on prisoners, and we've been able to but not with this man. We don't know what he wants. We don't know what makes him tick. Obviously it's something very bad.

MCEVERS: There still are three other American hostages in North Korea. What do we know about them? What does this mean for the efforts to get them released?

RICHARDSON: Well, if the North Koreans are smart, they'll let them go as a gesture of contrition and goodwill after this disaster. They were visited by the American diplomat in North Korea when he went to get Otto. I suspect they're in - I won't say good condition, but at least they're there. I think the State Department would have a better feel for how they're doing. But you know, this is Americans held as bargaining chips. There's also a Canadian there that we should be concerned about.

MCEVERS: You know, relationships between the U.S. and North Korea are already basically non-existent. Have you talked to the president about this, and what do you think the U.S.'s options are going forward?

RICHARDSON: Well, we have to be sending a very strong message that North Korea needs to have a suitable explanation. Secondly, we need to make sure that there's transparency on their part, maybe a human rights investigation by the U.N. But I wouldn't be opposed to putting more sanctions on North Korea. I don't think the military option makes any sense. I think eventually diplomacy must rule but not for now. I'm very sour and sad and angry right now.

MCEVERS: It's a tough question to ask, but you know, at this time, some people are pointing fingers at one administration or another. Do you think that's useful at this time?

RICHARDSON: It's not useful 'cause I worked with the Obama administration, and they were aware of this. The North Koreans were waiting for the new administration to come in. The Obama people tried. But the election happened, and the North Koreans wanted to probably deal with the Trump administration. And so they gave the Obamas no answer and didn't release Otto or disclose anything as they should have.

Whether your gaming mode is RPGs, tabletop games, TCGs, dice games, family board games, or video games, Gen Con has its sights aimed in your direction. Try a new game, pick up supplies for your current campaigns, network with gamers from faraway lands, or just wander the premises and gaze upon the wonders. Attendance in 2013 exceeded 49,000, an impressive 20% increase over 2012. Judging by how overcrowded the main exhibit hall became by mid-afternoon Saturday this year, I'd say they're on target for another increase.

This was my fifth GenCon and my wife's fourth, even though we're not certified pro gamers. Some of our personal geek interests intersect with enough of the available exhibits, dealers, and special events that we're rarely bored except in the occasional line, but those come with the territory. I have somewhat obsolete working knowledge of the early days of gaming. In my youth I used to spend dollar after dollar on the original Advanced Dungeons and Dragons hardcovers and modules, as well as various other TSR RPGs (Top Secret!, Star Frontiers, Marvel Super-Heroes, et al.) and a subscription to both Dragon Magazine and Dungeon Adventures (starting with issue #1!) until all my childhood friends moved away and took their Player Characters with them.

Anyway: we took too many photos because too many people did interesting things. Our photos will be paced out in a six-part series that I hope to post on a slightly-more-than-daily basis over the next few days, Lord willing and if non-internet responsibilities don't interfere. We begin with the easiest place to start: the winners of the 29th annual Gen Con Costume Contest.

Caveat for newcomers to MCC: some of our photos aren't the greatest ever. The 500 Ballroom is poorly lit at all times whether any conventions are using it or not. Flash photography was forbidden, which is just as well because using the flash from the non-Press-Pass, non-VIP seats produces even worse results. This is something my wife and I enjoy doing, to show our appreciation and awe for those with the flair for this particular aspect of the scene. We apologize in advance for the costumes we missed, and for the opportunities we blew because of our limitations and hindrances.

Comments and especially corrections are always welcome and appreciated. (That's my standing policy for every MCC entry anyway, not just the Gen Con six-parter.) I'm not plugged directly into every single geek scene out there. Very few geeks are, even the famous ones with their own YouTube channels. If you notice any wanton acts of mislabeling, please don't hesitate to call me out. I enjoy learning about new worlds and universes, giving credit where it's due, and dispelling my old man's ignorance.

Onward:

Listed for the sake of completeness are the other winners in these categories who successfully evaded our cameras. MCC management sincerely regrets the following omissions:

259594,False,1024,"I didn't play Darksiders until its PC release, which meant I'd already heard a million people compare it to Zelda and God of War. What a pleasant surprise to play the game and find that it had character of its own and kept rewarding me with new toys throughout its substantial and entertainingly silly story. Sitting down to play the sequel I thought it would just be more of the same. Wrong, wrong, wrong.

Before I talk about the game, here's some info on where I played it. In a church, in Amsterdam. I'm not telling you this because the setting matters, if the game is good I'd gladly play it in a cardboard box in Slough, but because the placement of the things inside the church on that particular day was pleasing. The nave was full of 360s, lined up awaiting eager journalists but I was ushered past them and directed to the elevation of the crossing, between the transepts, right before the altar. That's where the PCs lived.

When I'm invited to play a multiplatform title before release I expect to be plugged into a console so it was a pleasant surprise to have the PC build ready and waiting at all, let alone literally looking down on everybody else. The good news is, this time around we won't have to wait for a late release on PC. Development has been parallel across the platforms and although I was playing with an Xbox controller (as I will on release; it's that sort of game) and didn't have the chance to mess around with any settings beyond inverting my y-axis, it's clearly a handsome devil.

Now, onto the reasons why I was getting ahead of myself by expecting a rehash. The big difference between Darksiders and Darksiders II is the protagonist. At times as I played through the final parts of the game's first substantial realm I was convinced that I understood the formula entirely; design a protagonist and then build a game around him. Levels, abilities, enemies, dialogue, worlds – all are in service to Death, the spider-like, dodgy, jumpy horseman whose story this sequel tells.

Temporally, all of the action takes place alongside the events of the first game. While War was stomping around our Earthly post-apocalypse, smiting demons and angels alike, Death was traversing other, more mysterious realms. By more mysterious I mean more imaginative. It's not that I didn't enjoy the setting of the first game but I'd seen it before. I play games so burning cities filled with angry demons are as familiar to me as my own kitchen.

Darksiders II moves away from the familiar and into more inventive territory. The Makers' Realm that I explored is part traditional fantasy, part proto-mechanical golem factory and altogether Vigil's own creation. As in the original, strong voicework and an interesting companion contribute to the world-building but it's Death himself who makes this a sequel that is more than a retread.

In some hands, a change of protagonist could mean a change of skin but Death is not War, though obviously related in many ways. It's a third-person action adventure with a similar visual style but, to return to somewhat lazy comparisons, this is less God of War and more Prince of Persia.

The towering, crumbling structures of the Makers' Realm are pathways as much as obstacles, tracks along which Death can clamber, climb and wall-run. I spent less time scything down enemies than I did looking for hand-holds, overhangs and broken machinery from which to swing. There's still plenty of combat, which involves the expected combos and side-splitting finishing moves, but it's once an area is cleared that Death shows what he brings to the party.

Running along walls above spitting lakes of lava, scaling a toppled tower, activating ancient and ominous machinery; that's what he does best. The Makers, from what I can gather, are the Genesis of all things and their realm is one of creation. Accompanied by one of the beings, best described as a giant dwarf, Death is attempting to activate a huge automaton that will assist him in his quest. However, a corruption has taken hold in this world and, presumably, all others, a webbing of dark fluids and crystals growing on surfaces and infecting some of the Makers' own machinery.

To clear it, Death can hop onto Custodians, large humanoid structures that have a sphere in place of their legs and trundle about smashing enemies into pieces. They're not just battle-mounts though, they're also the only means of clearing the corruption and therefore accessing new areas. And that's not all either. They can also fire large chains, slamming into distant walls to create a bridge. More still, as those spheres they roll about on fit perfectly into indents in the floor; parking on top of these changes the",0.5985324880239152,0.6985324880239152,-0.1,0.0

His new book, ""Get What's Yours: The Secrets to Maxing Out Your Social Security Benefits,"" (co-authored with Paul Solman and Making Sen$e Medicare columnist Phil Moeller) was published in February by Simon & Schuster.

Watch Larry explain how Paul and his wife could collect an extra $50,000 in Social Security benefits:

Last week economist Alicia Munnell wrote the following in a MarketWatch column:

The president's fiscal-year 2015 budget included language to ""eliminate aggressive Social Security-claiming strategies, which allow upper-income beneficiaries to manipulate the timing of collection of Social Security benefits in order to maximize delayed retirement credits."" This is a great idea. Work that our center did more than five years ago showed that this option could cost Social Security as much as $9.5 billion annually, and that benefits go to those with the know-how to game the system.

In another column entitled ""Let's Close Down Social Security Gaming"" she writes, ""Today people are writing bestselling books about how to get the maximum out of Social Security.""

Alicia seems to be referring to my New York Times bestseller, ""Get What's Yours: The Secrets to Maxing Out Your Social Security,"" which, as my byline indicates, I recently co-authored with NewsHour economics correspondent Paul Solman and journalist Phil Moeller. But is maxing out ""gaming the system""? At the end of a broadcast story he did on Social Security for the NewsHour, Paul asked me if we were promoting ""loopholes"" in the Social Security rules. I replied that you could view it as a loophole but that on the other hand, couples who benefit from strategies like file-and-suspend pay a lot of taxes. And there are other loopholes in our tax system like the mortgage interest deduction, for example.

""Would it be fair for some of us to take it and others not because we didn't know about it?"" I asked. ""I don't see any reason why people shouldn't get what is theirs, what they're legally entitled to.""

Our fiscal system, in general, and Social Security, in particular, is an incredibly complex maze of entangled provisions, most of which were put into place in piecemeal fashion over the years. Saying that provision X is unfair because it benefits double-income earners and should be eliminated begs the question of whether all the other provisions in our fiscal laws that disadvantage them are also unfair. Our system is replete with positive taxes and negative taxes, which we call benefits. If you want to make the case that the system is unfair, you need to look at all the net taxes people in different situations are paying.

We have roughly 25 major fiscal systems at the federal and state levels (Food Stamps, Medicaid, Medicare, the Earned Income Tax Credit, the Child Tax Credit, the Alternative Minimum Tax, Supplemental Security Income, Transitional Aid to Families with Dependent Children, Obamacare, the New High Income Medicare taxes, the progressive Part B Medicare premium, the FICA payroll tax, progessive federal tax brackets, state income taxes, state and local sales taxes, federal and state estate and gift taxes, 12 different Social Security benefits, federal and state corporate income taxes, and the list goes on) that impact what we pay on net to government.

I'm in the process of doing research with Alan Auerbach, an economist at Berkeley, to put all of these programs together to understand the system's true progressivity — how net tax rates differ across households of higher and lower means. I'll be writing about our findings in this space in a few weeks, but for now let me assuage my dear friend Alicia with these words. ""Telling people how to get what's theirs"" doesn't game the system. Nor does taking all the benefits to which you were legally entitled, including the ""free"" spousal benefit using the file and suspend strategy (which you did), game the system. It's not our jobs as individual citizens to make the system more equitable by paying",0.6727234490106212,0.7727234490106212,-0.1,0.0

259126,False,1024,"The mother of four was only 38 years old and had been living in Germany since 2011. The former Muslim woman had converted to Christianity and was involved in a project to help refugees run by her community church in Prien am Chiemsee in Bavaria. None of her friends had ever thought it possible that the woman would be stabbed by a 29-year-old refugee, also from Afghanistan, on the street in front of her children's eyes.

Police were initially cautious regarding the motive of the crime. The attacker was considered to be ""mentally unstable"" and is undergoing psychiatric treatment, but the investigators are also considering the woman's conversion into a different religion as a possible motive. After all, the suspected murderer had been described as ""very religious.""

Muslims distance themselves from the crime

As investigations progress, the victim's funeral (pictured above) took place on Wednesday. At the funeral service, the community pastor spoke about the reactions triggered by the crime. Speaking to DW, Karl-Friedrich Wackerbath said that Muslims turned up spontaneously and excused themselves for what had happened. They also expressed hope that the incident would not again lead to a general smear campaign against Muslims.

Even though clerics from their home countries shared different convictions, Muslims in Germany would not threaten to kill anyone who converted from Islam to Christianity. ""The danger however, is that a wedge is being driven between our cultures and religions.""

Refugee victims feel helpless

A case of discrimination

Everyday life in a refugee shelter is different. Since 2015, there has been an increase in the number of reports about Christians among refugees who have been verbally or physically attacked. Although the situation has eased with a lesser number of refugees coming to Germany, there are still some embarrassing situations for converts among the asylum seekers.

Victims feel helpless because they are not taken seriously

For example, a graffiti on one of the victims' walls reads, ""It is time to kill the non-believers."" Entry to the bathroom, showers or the kitchen has been restricted with the words, ""The impure cannot enter,"" written on the doors. Converts are made to hear Islamic prayers or verses from the Quran, played through mobile phones. Those not wearing headscarves or openly wearing crosses are subject to harsh accusations. Apart from insults and abuses, there are knife attacks, and every now and then, death threats.

Representatives of church organizations helping refugees told DW that such incidents occur quite often. The ""Iraner Seelsorge"" in Hannover, which counsels refugees from Iran, reported a case in which a young convert was bullied at school for so long that he had to leave it. At the Evangelical-Lutheran-Trinity community in Berlin's Steglitz area, Pastor Gottfried Martens complains that victims reporting such cases were not taken seriously.

Last year, the head of the German Bishops' Conference, Cardinal Reinhard Marx, as well as the Evangelical Church in Germany's Heinrich-Bedford Strohm admitted to cases of intimidation and violence against Christian refugees. One was taking it seriously, but did not yet have a clear picture of the extent of the religious conflict. The basic idea of the churches was that these were isolated incidents which were causing worry.

Only the tip of the iceberg?

Pastor Gottfried Martens helps refugees from Iran and Afghanistan

""The isolated case theory has been disproved,"" said Ado Greve in a conversation with DW. Greve is a spokesman for the non-denominational Christian charity ""Open Doors"" in Kelkheim, a suburb of Frankfurt. The organization attempts to give a voice to Christian minorities around the world. No one had ever expected Germany to have a role to play in this. When complaints about the discrimination of Christian refugees wouldn't stop, Open Doors decided to get some figures on its own. The first attempt was publicly criticized because of supposedly unreliable data. But on October 2016, the organization followed up with a second publication. ""Fifty-six percent spoke about physical attacks and 83 percent of those who we questioned admitted that they were attacked several times,"" Ado Greve said.

When pointed out that this information was based only on 750 conversations, Greve responded with a counter question: ""How many affected refugees do we need so we do not treat these as isolated cases anymore? Five hundred? One thousand?"" This is a pointless and also a humiliating discussion. Every case is one too many. One did not also claim at any point in time that this was a representative survey. It is also not relevant how bad the attacks would be. Even a death threat can do enormous damage to the person. Because in the countries, where the attackers and their victims come from, the threats are often followed by deeds.

The Christian asylum seekers questioned by Open Doors came mostly from Iran (304), from Syria (263) and Afghanistan (63). The attackers were people from their own countries and also",0.0,0.7950625714352902,-1.4000000000000001,0.0
256702,True,438,"Last night, former Athletic Brett Anderson had some choice words for the fans on Twitter. The comments seemed to be directed at A's fans in particular. His tweets have been deleted, but there were some screen grabs up this morning.

The offending tweets seemed to begin with, ""If your Twitter handle has what position of the field you sit in as a fan…your life is beyond brutal and obsolete."" After a fan said that Anderson knows how passionate the fans are, Anderson responded with, ""That means 0.""

The evening concluded with Brett Anderson tweeting out, ""A lion does not lose sleep over the opinions of sheep."" That's some pretty high praise for oneself, considering this ""lion"" has made 14 starts in the past 3 years. The player that the A's got in a trade for Anderson this past offseason, Drew Pomeranz, has already made 8 this season. The only ones getting ""fleeced"" here are Anderson's current employers.

Brett Anderson is no lion. Not even the fictional lions of House Lannister would have him. The people that did accept him, those that reside in the right field bleachers in Oakland, have now been slighted by this injury-prone putz. What Brett Anderson has forgotten is that the people that put where they sit in their Twitter handles are generally the people that actually go to the games. The people that supported him over the years, even when he was constantly on the DL.

Let's take a minute to look at the photo of Brett Anderson above. This was taken at the beginning of Spring Training. A day when you get to start playing the game you love, and compete for a championship. Anderson's expression does not match the excitement he should feel. Instead, it looks like frowning is the shape his face has taken from years of being sullen.

This picture explains Brett Anderson's comments, however. He is not a happy man, and people that are unhappy generally lash out at any and everyone.

On the bright side, he's not an A's on-field problem anymore, but A's fans always pay their debts.",0.7226928563493075,0.7226928563493075,0.0,0.0

Sungrye-Mun (This name is incorrect, see Name section) is a downloadable Landmark Building for SimCity 4 Rush Hour/Deluxe, released as the Plugin Pack 009 free Downloadable Content.

It provides no services aside from a Landmark Effect and Mayor Rating boost.

It is a recreation of Namdaemun in Seoul, South Korea, built in 1398, as it appeared before it was destroyed by fire and rebuilt.

Name

When Maxis made this landmark, they managed to give it more phonetically correct, but still incorrect names for every translation except Korean (where it is correctly named 숭례문). The name given for every language other than Korean for display in the menus is Sungrye-Mun; On the download page, it was listed as Nam Dae Moon; and in its Exemplar files, it is referred to as Lm64x64_NamDaeMoon_04B9.

The formal name recognised by the South Korean Government is Sungnyemun, however the name Namdaemun is more well-known among Westerners and is used among some South Koreans to describe it informally.

Even the Japanese, Thai, Traditional Chinese and Simplified Chinese translations, which are meant to use the localised character sets, are wrong; they list the incorrect English name.

All languages except Korean use a duplicate of the English Description LTEXT file.

Trivia

When Maxis made the model, it was rotated roughly 180° from the direction it should face. In reality, the staircase was on the northern side of the gate, inside the city walls, but in the model it is on the Southern side.",0.6728352369668119,0.6728352369668119,0.0,0.0

256523,False,1024,"You'd be wrong. In fact, I draw a hard line when it comes to my laissez-faire attitude toward personal hygiene, and stinky armpits definitely crosses it. But I have a difficult time saying no to any story opportunities that come my way. So when my editor asked if I'd write about going deodorant-free for two weeks, I enthusiastically agreed—and then spent the entire night dreading the grossness I was about to endure.

One way I convinced myself to get behind this undertaking: I considered the possible health benefits. There's certainly no shortage of quackish websites and crunchy green blogs warning that aluminum—the active ingredient in antiperspirant—causes breast cancer. But I wanted something more concrete.

Both the American Cancer Society and the National Cancer Institute say there's no evidence directly linking antiperspirant use to cancer. But when I dug a little deeper, the findings seemed less than straightforward. Estrogen exposure is a known risk factor for breast cancer, and research shows that aluminum exhibits estrogenic activity in human breast tissue. Even more unsettling: Research shows the number of breast cancers diagnosed in the upper, outer area of the breast (the part closest to the armpit) is on the rise.

Try These Natural Deodorants From the Runner's World Store

This research isn't proof that antiperspirant causes breast cancer. But some experts who've studied the chemicals wonder if aluminum—combined with all the other compounds found in antiperspirants and the many personal care products we all use—could add up to something harmful.

One of those experts is Philippa Darbre, Ph.D., an associate professor of oncology at the University of Reading in the UK. Darbre says, ""Hundreds of environmental compounds that can mimic estrogen action have now been measured as present in the human breast."" While big questions remain unanswered, Darbre doesn't rule out the idea that these complex chemical mixtures could cause or contribute to the development of breastcancer.

If skipping the no-sweat stick meant I could lower my chemical load, I was willing to give it a try. And lucky for me, the first few days were easy. Temperatures in New Haven, Connecticut, where I live, hovered around 80 degrees, and the humidity was low. I didn't feel any soppier or stinkier, and nobody seemed to wrinkle their nose in disgust while they were around me.


Things got tougher once the spell of perfect weather ended. As the mercury approached 90 degrees and the air grew stickier, I started to sweat. A lot. The smell didn't seem awful to me, so I convinced myself that it didn't bother anyone around me, either. (If it did, they were too polite to say so.)

But the wet feeling under my arms felt gross. And even thought I think of myself as someone who doesn't obsess over what other people think, I was self-conscious about walking around with pit stains.

The worst moment came on a particularly humid night when my husband and I went out for dinner. I wore my favorite white silk tank top, and regretted it almost as soon as we began the 15-minute walk to the restaurant. Within five minutes, I found myself casually lifting my arms in an attempt to catch a cool, semi-drying breeze.

It didn't work. The next day that top went straight to the dry cleaner.

Despite the scorching temps, I wasn't about to carry around extra shirts or shower three times a day. I was also entirely uninterested in home remedies like lemon juice (seems like it would sting?) or baking soda paste (way too messy). So I took to washing under my arms with a warm, soapy cloth whenever I felt sweaty. It was effective and, since I work from home, not too inconvenient. (If I worked in an office, I would've kept a stash of baby wipes in my bag at all times.)

On the last day of the experiment, it was 93 degrees out and oppressively humid. My husband and I were out for a long walk with our dog, and toward the end he said, ""I think I can smell you."" Even though we've been together for 12 years, it was still embarrassing, and I was glad the whole ordeal was almost over. The next morning I returned to my trusty antiperspirant with newfound appreciation.

Explosion That Injured at Least 29 an 'Intentional Act,' New York City Mayor Says (ABC News)

.

An explosion that rocked Manhattan's Chelsea neighborhood and injured at least 29 people appears to have been ""an intentional act"" -- but not related to terrorism, according to New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio.

The cause of the explosion has not been determined, said New York City police commissioner James O'Neill. The explosion, which seriously injured at least one person, happened on West 23rd Street late Saturday in an area frequented by shoppers and diners.

""New York City experienced a very bad incident,"" de Blasio said at a news conference. ""We have no credible and specific threat at this moment.""

A possible secondary device was located a few blocks away on 27th Street, between 6th Avenue and 7th Avenue, the NYPD Special Operations Division said at 11 p.m. The device, a pressure cooker, was removed by authorities. It was in a white plastic bag with tape, wiring and a cell phone or other electronic device.

Police said the device was to be detonated at the NYPD's firing range in the Bronx. Police had earlier advised residents on the block where the device was found to stay away from windows facing 27th Street.

There were other suspicious packages and incidents in the area since the pressure cooker was discovered, but they were deemed not dangerous, police said.

The explosion on 23rd Street between Sixth and Seventh Avenues was seen by police officers driving by about 8:30 p.m., according to police. The fire department heard the explosion and responded immediately.

Officials said the NYPD has video it is reviewing and De Blasio urged any witnesses or people who may have information to come forward.

Two law enforcement sources said the explosion occurred in a dumpster, and the NYPD Counterterrorism Bureau tweeted a photo of a mangled dumpster after saying they were responding to the explosion.

The NYPD Bomb Squad was searching the area and checking garbage cans for any other possible explosive devices.

The FBI and Homeland Security officials, along with the ATF arson and explosive task force were also at the scene.

Surveillance video recovered from West 23rd Street shows the explosion and contains other evidence that indicates to investigators the original object was intentionally left next to the construction trash container, described as 4 ft. by 4 ft. by 3 ft. in size.

In one video obtained by police, a man is seen crossing the street in the vicinity of where the original object was left. The trash container was blown clear into the street by the force of the blast.

The object left behind could be a large tool box, left next to one of the several commercial trash containers in front of a building that has been under construction. Investigators are trying to determine if there is a connection to this seemingly ""random construction site.""

The explosion even startled residents who were a few blocks away. Chelsea resident Michelle Leifer was walking her dog in Madison Square Park when she heard a loud boom and rumbling. ""I heard a loud boom and felt rumbling,"" she tells ABC News. ""I wasn't sure if it was an explosion or if a large truck had gone by. One of the park's maintenance men came in and said he got an alert on his phone that there was an explosion on 23rd and 6th. As I was leaving the park, I saw a smoke cloud hovering in that area. Then police cars and firetrucks started streaming in.""

Meanwhile, a ""possible secondary device"" was located a few blocks away on 27th Street, between 6th Avenue and 7th Avenue, the NYPD Special Operations Division said around 11 p.m. The device, a pressure cooker, was removed by authorities. The device was in a white plastic bag with tape, wiring and a cell phone or other electronic device.

The explosion occurred one day after O'Neill was sworn as the new police commissioner following Bill Bratton's retirement.

The mayor said the Chelsea explosion has no apparent connection to the explosive device that detonated in Seaside Park, New Jersey, Saturday morning. Nobody was injured in the New Jersey incident, which occurred at a time when a 5k run to benefit U.S. Marines and sailors was scheduled, but the race was delayed because so many runners had signed up.

More importantly though, it gives us some idea of what 3rd parties have to deal with cost wise for the cartridges. Given how inexpensive it is to manufacture Blu-ray discs these days, not to mention the fast turnaround time, it would be nice to know what Nintendo is doing with cartridges? It might be an order of magnitude more costly per cartridge.


What's the cost per game for a publisher?

What percent is Nintendo keeping?

What is the turnaround time for production? Can it match the few days of Blu-ray manufacture and shipment to retailers?

How about ramp up time? Between the time a game has a ""golden master"" and they start manufacturing the cartridges?


There is a reason that even with the huge sales of the DS and then the very respectable 3DS sales (over 60 million) that there is very little mainstream 3rd party title support. A lot of that probably has to do with cartridge cost risk factors.


If somehow the Switch cartridge story is different, then maybe there will be real 3rd party support this time around, but it seems unlikely Now that we know the relative sizes of a few games, it is apparent, the anemic 32 GB of internal storage is not going to support many digital downloads.More importantly though, it gives us some idea of what 3rd parties have to deal with cost wise for the cartridges. Given how inexpensive it is to manufacture Blu-ray discs these days, not to mention the fast turnaround time, it would be nice to know what Nintendo is doing with cartridges? It might be an order of magnitude more costly per cartridge.What's the cost per game for a publisher?What percent is Nintendo keeping?What is the turnaround time for production?

How much Nintendo charges for the carts, I don't know. How much profit Nintendo makes selling a cart to a publisher, I don't know.


I guess I can't answer any of your questions, sorry for trying.

also, its possible that nintendo is wrapping the cost of the cart into their royalty... this is pure baseless speculation, but it is an option.


so if they take a $10 royalty on a boxed retail game, the cost of the cart would be included.


that's what I would do, but I'm not Nintendo. Uh, later dudes. S you in your As. Don't wear a C and J all over your Bs. I know in the GBA era the cost was about $4 per cart...

It's not. This is one of the things that we can say for sure. If that were the disparity then you'd never see things like limited-run versions of niche games on Vita.


Remember that manufacturing cost is only part of the total cost of a physical medium. In terms of packaging, storage and shipping, Switch cards should match or beat Blu-ray. That will reduce the price advantage a little, though the advantage will still be on the Blu-ray side.

255901,False,1024,"Carol Costello is the host of ""Across America With Carol Costello"" on HLN. The views expressed in this commentary are her own.

(CNN) It seems like America's every cultural moment is under review thanks to Harvey Weinstein, Roy Moore and the rest of the men accused of sexual misconduct this year. I can't even watch a Christmas movie like ""It's a Wonderful Life"" without wondering if it is inherently sexist. And I love that movie.

But seriously, if gorgeous, brilliant Mary had never met her George Bailey, would she have ended up working in a library? Worse than that, would she have been an old maid -- a fate apparently worse than death when the movie was made in 1946?

I am not alone in my musings. Blaine Greteman, who writes for The Week, questions whether ""The Nutcracker"" is appropriate for young girls. He asks, ""What the hell is going on with Godfather Drosselmeyer?""

And feminists have long objected to that flirty Christmas Carol, ""Baby It's Cold Outside."" That's why every holiday season someone writes an article urging America to retire the song because of its rape-like undertones. It starts innocently enough. Guy meets gal on cold Christmas night. They share a drink. I am all in until the duo sings this:

Man: Put some records on while I pour

Gal: The neighbors might think

Man: Baby, it's bad out there

Gal: Say what's in this drink?

Man: No cabs to be had out there

The song was written in 1944, when women were expected to, as billionaire Foster Friess ""joked"" in 2012, put aspirin ""between their knees"" for birth control. I try to keep an open mind, but yuck!

But have we become too sensitive to lyrics, movies and plays? CNN's legal analyst and my good friend, Paul Callan, wonders if the Broadway hit, ""The Producers,"" could be censured. ""I think ... Ulla was the sexy receptionist who got her butt tapped a few times by all of the people in this very successful Broadway show,"" he said on HLN. ""I don't think we can run that on Broadway anymore, given Wendy's attitude about these things and how dead serious people are about this.""

Wendy is Wendy Murphy -- a fiery former prosecutor and staunch defender of sex abuse victims. Murphy and Callan were arguing over whether a ""zero-tolerance"" attitude has taken hold in our culture -- one in which an accuser points a finger and the accused is automatically deemed guilty.

Pop culture is ""not the point,"" Murphy said passionately. ""These are real human beings; this is not theater. Real human beings and women have a right to work in equal and safe conditions. That's not asking for much.""

However, old-fashioned songs, plays and ballets are a part of the real world. They can influence the way kids think about gender roles. Perhaps it is time we retire these dinosaurs and bask in a brighter, more equitable future. It's happening right under our noses.

After all, women are leading the box office in 2017 -- and not one, unlike Ulla in ""The Producers,"" sings a song called ""If You Got It, Flaunt It.""

The ""Last Jedi"" features Rey, a smart, strong freedom fighter. ""Wonder Woman"" boasts a superhero who is compassionate, smart and a kick-ass fighter. And ""Beauty and the Beast"" features Belle, who refuses to settle for a man who is not up to her standards.

That's not to say there hasn't been backlash. Remember the all-female remake of ""Ghostbusters?"" Sexist and racist trolls, angry that women replaced the original male characters, made life hell for Melissa McCarthy, Kate McKinnon, Kristen Wiig and especially Leslie Jones.

The hateful provocateur Milo Yiannopoulos was front and center. He told ABC News the recast made him feel oppressed. ""I would rather a healthier, equitable arrangement that existed between the sexes rather than the sort of vindictive feminism that seems to exist now,"" Yiannopoulos said . ""And by the way, most people agree with me. Fewer than one in five women in America describe themselves as a feminist, because they see what I see.""

Too bad, Milo. The ""Ocean's 8"" trailer has just taken social media by storm. And Sandra Bullock, Anne Hathaway, Rihanna, Cate Blanchett and Mindy Kaling have replaced the original male cast.

And guess what?

The cast is ready to go to war with sexist trolls who might be angry that women are treading into male territory. As Bullock told Entertainment Weekly, ""I'll tell you, we've got some feisty",0.4620895262154048,0.7620895262154048,-0.30000000000000004,0.0
257854,False,1024,"Last month, the NTMA sold the first 'century bond' in its history – €100m-worth of Government paper maturing in 2116 and priced at a yield of 2.35%. Given the current pricing of 30-year bonds, a comparable US bond would yield around 5.7-6.0 % if the US Treasury actually tried to issue one.

The 100-year bond was a symbolic point for Ireland.

Coming while the country commemorated the centenary of the 1916 rising, it was a marker of final departure from the unprecedented (in scale and nature) financial and economic crises of 2008-2016. As a signal, it was of immense value for the political elites of the state, even if of zero economic or social value to ordinary people.

Yet the irony was there for anyone to see: another 100-year bond was issued by Mexico back in 2015. Super-long-dated debt, it seems, is neither a sign of economic success, nor a signal of institutional maturity – a point missed by the Irish tax-and-borrow -and-spend cheerleaders.

To understand that, it is necessary to look at the political dynamics in post-election Ireland. Just as Irish borrowing costs continued to trace historical lows, the country's political crisis was in full swing. Two months without a Government would have put any normal economy onto a negative watch with the bond-rating agencies. But in the case of Ireland, no one seemed to care – the markets chugged along, cheering the fortunes of this debt-laden country, and buying Irish debt to beat the band.

This is in stark contrast to Ireland five years ago, when yields on Irish 10-year bonds hit highs of 14.2%. Today, they are sitting at around 0.7%. Much of this is driven by the ECB's policy of quantitative easing, that saw Frankfurt buy billions worth of Irish bonds, dropping rates and propping up 'private-sector' buyers of Government debt. But much of it is also down to global investors' ignorance of the economic conditions underwriting the solvency of the Irish Exchequer.

Let's take a look at the key sources of sovereign risks.

Politically, the Irish legislature and government establishment now resembles a beehive with lots of buzzing and little serious long-term output. The resolution of the stalemate at the top of the Government 'Confidence and Supply' pyramid, seemingly achieved by the grand 'facilitation' agreement between Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil is a temporary bridge across the gaping chasms between the Irish electorate and the country's elites. This chasm is best highlighted by the lack of any policy coherence driving the two parties.

The problem, from the long-run policy point of view, is not the expected duration of the Government, but the policy vacuum that it is likely to engender. The agreement between FF and FG suggest that the Government will focus on 'spend more, tax less' objectives that are based on the implicit assumption that strong economic growth will last the next three years.

Hence the rumoured commitments include: reviving 24-hour cardiac care at Waterford Regional hospital, spending more on policing (solely on expanding the Garda ranks and supporting pay increases in the force), 'investing' in other public services (read: increasing pay and hiring), extending mortgage-interest relief, subsidising access to housing for public-sector workers, and expanding the Rent Supplement scheme.

The game of plodding political chess since the 2016 General Election has been about giveaways for October Budget 2017. Over the course of negotiations, Fine Gael has moved from a €500m commitment to over €1bn in spending and tax cuts, without any new resources being identified to fund it. And that is before we cost in the Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil commitment to replace the Lansdowne Road Agreement upon its expiration in September 2018. For this, the Coalition has agreed to create yet another quango. No prizes for guessing which direction taxpayers' cash will be shovelled once it completes its work.

All of this strongly signals that the new Government is willing to trade the competitiveness gains achieved through the suffering of private and public workers for Dáil votes in the near term. But it also signals the new Government's total incapacity to focus on a long-term economic agenda.

Which brings us to the second source of sovereign risk: the economic conditions underpinning Ireland's miraculous recovery since 2014.

The aggressive fiscal expansion which Fine Gael will oversee will be built on expectations of robust growth in Government revenue. The expected sources for this growth, in turn, are sustained strength in corporation-tax and income-tax revenue, and an uplift in capital-tax revenue, due to real-estate buzz. These hopes carry significant risks; some are better understood than others, and all are linked to the prospects of the Government delivering long-term growth backed",0.7321739579924813,0.7321739579924813,0.0,0.0
256147,True,398,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS:

Accurate diagnosis and treatment of subclinical hypothyroidism (SCH) is challenging in clinical practice because of differing upper limits of normal (ULN) for thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH). This review summarises the various definitions of SCH and their impact on reported SCH prevalence.

METHODOLOGY:

Articles reporting the prevalence of SCH in relation to the ULN of TSH in human studies were identified through an English-language PubMed search for 'subclinical hypothyroidism,' 'prevalence,' and 'TSH' within the title and/or abstract. Relevant articles and related literature were selected for inclusion.

RESULTS:

Estimates for the prevalence of SCH varied by sex, age, race/ethnicity, and geographic location (range, 0.4-16.9%). Higher rates of SCH were consistently reported in women (0.9-16.9%) and older individuals (2.7-16.9%). However, the ULN of TSH in those considered free of thyroid disease and not at risk increased progressively with age, suggesting that reports of SCH prevalence in elderly people may be overestimated. Multiple studies reported an increased risk of progression to overt hypothyroidism among individuals with elevated TSH and antithyroid antibodies.

CONCLUSIONS:

Given the variable definition of SCH based on an inconsistent ULN for TSH, it is currently difficult to ascertain the true prevalence of SCH and to correctly label and treat patients with SCH; use of age-adjusted definitions may be considered when assessing prevalence. A diagnosis of SCH does not necessarily merit treatment, especially if TSH elevations are transient (i.e. not persistent for > 3-6 months) and the patient lacks other risk factors for developing overt hypothyroidism.

258772,False,1024,"Tools for Exterior Painting Posted on February 18, 2018 | By STEVE Have you ever thought of trying to tackle interior and exterior painting on your own? It's a big job, but when the price tag of a professional contractor seems just a bit outside your budget, you may be tempted to DIY your homes' paint job. However, before you rush off to the nearest hardware store, take a moment to learn about the most important tools you'll need to do a good job. Remember, having the right tools and materials helps to ensure that the job is done right and helps to protect your home. A poorly done job will just need to be redone sooner and may cost even more than your original contractor's estimate in necessary repairs! First you'll want a good five-in-one tool. It should be able to pull nails, scrap paint or spread putty, open your paint can, clean out cracks before caulking, squeeze paint out of rollers and all of that should be contained in a handle that is sturdy enough to use to pound shut the lids of paint cans. While there are seven-in-one tools and other tools with even more features than that, a five-in-one tool should be sufficient for a standard house painting job. Next is a good ladder. You'll want a ladder that you can use both inside and outside the house depending on which area you're going to be painting. There are many different types of convertible ladders and though they may be more expensive on the outset, in the end it's cheaper than buying two or three ladders to have in different places all around the house. Plus, if you have one ladder that can be used to reach all different heights then you only have to find space to store one ladder rather than two. Another necessary tool is drop cloths; you will need these whether you're painting inside your house and want to protect floors and furniture from drips, or outside your house where you'll want to protect grass and bushes. One of the most important steps in prepping the outside of your home to be painted is to pressure wash. This means that flecks of paint and debris can fall down on your grass, trees and plants and destroy them. Covering them with a cloth drop cloth allows the water to pass through but catches any debris from the house keeping your plants safe. Local interior painters If you don't have a pressure washer, it's a tool you may want to add it to your list of tools. If your house is built with wood siding, however, skip the pressure washer and instead go for a good quality spray nozzle for your garden hose; a power washer can damage wood. You'll also need a stiff bristle brush, putty knife and sander to help quickly strip and remove loose paint once the house has dried. Be warned, if your house was built before 1978 its original coat of paint may contain lead. If you think your house may have been painted with lead paint then it's best to give up the idea of a DIY paint job. The lead can leech through layers of paint and cause serious health problems.… Read More »

The young and nubile counselors all begin to die extremely bloody deaths at the hands of an unseen killer during a rainstorm which isolates the camp.

During play, sometimes the audio sounds very low quality, and in some instances, there is a lot of static.

When a large amount of sounds are being triggered (usually through weapon fire and enemy attacks), the sound can experience degradation. This issue should resolve itself once the amount of action on screen dies down.


After launching the game, I am not seeing an option to launch into the Multiplayer mode?

In order to access the multiplayer section of the game, you will need to download the day 1 patch. This contains the entire multiplayer game mode and multiple gameplay improvements for the campaign.


Why is the patch size so large? Is there any way I can skip downloading the patch?

You must download the day 1 patch to play in Multiplayer mode. The day 1 patch is required in some regions but is recommended for all as it contains the entire multi-player game mode as well as multiple gameplay improvements for the single player campaign.

258929,True,361,"Twenty-five years after the fatwa, Salman Rushdie is safer but not safe, and speech for other writers is far from free

""I wish I'd written a more critical book."" Exactly a quarter-century after the Ayatollah Khomeini threatened Salman Rushdie and ""all those involved"" in the publication of The Satanic Verses with death, the bravery of the author's immediate reaction is all the more impressive.

For Ian McEwan, remembering those times in 2012, the first few months were the worst:

No one knew anything. Were Iranian agents, professional killers, already in place in the UK when the fatwa was proclaimed? Might a ""freelancer"", stirred by a denunciation in a mosque, be an effective assassin? The media excitement was so intense that it was hard to think straight.

Hundreds dead in riots, an editor killed, a publisher shot, a translator stabbed and books burned from Bolton to Islamabad. Sometimes it's easy to forget the fatwa's human cost among the wry anecdotes of clandestine dinner parties and Special Branch minders.

Rushdie's still not sure if the struggle over The Satanic Verses has produced a clear winner, explaining to Stuart Jeffries in 2012 that ""the book is still in print and the author wasn't suppressed so it was a victory in that sense. But the fear and menaces have grown.""

Twenty-five years on, Rushdie says he's a ""level three or four"" risk now, even though the fatwa against him still appears to be in force. In the week where Penguin India withdrew Wendy Doniger's The Hindus from circulation, the anniversary reminds us that fear and menaces surround any writer who dares to ""provoke the imagination"".",0.6265400493308111,0.7265400493308111,-0.1,0.0

257726,False,1024,"This class will introduce one form of play at a time. With over 70 videos featuring a variety of breeds, sizes of dogs, and handlers, you're sure to find the information you need to form a fun and satisfying play relationship with your individual dog!

We'll discuss the correct presentation of toys, learning how to make cookies into an event, and understanding how to interact with your dog in the way that he likes best. It takes time and effort to learn your dog, to know what to do, when to do it, and when to STOP doing it. Taking this time is well worth the effort because the end result will be a dog who naturally looks to you for both direction and entertainment.

For some people - and dogs - play comes naturally. But did you know that good play is more than simply WANTING to interact with your dog? Good play requires the ability to engage with your canine companion on a level that taps into his natural interests, and this ability is one part art and one part mechanical skills. This class will teach you both of these elements.

Sample Lecture

Lecture #3: Toy play

Toy play is one of the hardest and most complicated things to talk about because very small changes in our technique can make big differences in the dog's response. One of the easiest ways to think about playing with your dog is to consider the natural prey sequence. Dogs are attracted to the movement of a prey animal AWAY from their direction of travel. When the animal is caught, it must try to escape! To be interesting, the dog needs to have a fight (catching a lizard is not nearly as interesting as catching a squirrel because of the contest).

What would the squirrel do?

The most important factor in developing your dog's toy interest is the action and movement of the toy. With this in mind, always ask yourself, ""What would the squirrel do?""

Visualize a fence with a squirrel on it. The first time your dog notices the squirrel is probably the first time the squirrel notices the dog. The dog will look intently and possibly move towards the squirrel. The squirrel runs away! Note that the dog did not catch the squirrel - it's likely he never came within 50 feet of the squirrel - but the next time your dog sees the squirrel, there will be an additional edge of curiosity and boldness. The dog is likely to start moving towards the squirrel much more quickly, and possibly with focused intent. Again, the squirrel runs away!

Although the dog never gets near the squirrel, this lack of interaction does not diminish his interest in getting closer. Indeed, the escape of the squirrel will increase his interest and further pique his prey drive. A large part of the excitement of the hunt is visually tracking the movement of the prey; visual tracking is rewarding in and of itself. Each time your dog has a visual interaction with that squirrel, he gathers information. He learns how fast squirrels can run, what direction of travel they prefer, and what causes them to panic. These experiences will build his confidence, his visual tracking will improve, and his determination to catch the squirrel – or at least to get much closer to it – will also increase.

In short, the dog does not need to get to the prey in order to show increased interest, focus, drive, and energy. This reality is very important, because the biggest mistake trainers make in playing with tug toys is that in the desire to get the dog to hold the toy, they forget the all-important process of engaging the dog's interest using prey moves with the toy.

Squirrels are NOT suicidal. Squirrels do not move towards a dog, except in a panic. Squirrels don't subject themselves to a thorough sniffing. Squirrels are highly frightened of dogs in their first few encounters and their behavior reflects this. They run away and try to escape. Over time, an experienced squirrel might become bolder around dogs – waiting longer to run away – but this comes well after the dogs are bound and determined to get to them. What is the dog's reaction to this escaping prey object? They will display increased intensity, focus, and desire to move from a quick look in the distance to bridging that gap between them as quickly as possible. This is the beginning of the chase. If you do not respect this natural chain in behavior, then you are undermining your dog's natural prey based behavior, and next thing you know....

Your dog is avoiding toys

The sight of a toy causes the dog to walk away or get scared. This is bad news. If you've gotten yourself into that mess, the answer is not crating your dog to create desire. You need to start over again with the best possible technique you can master.

She was born July 16, 1914, six years before women gained the right to vote - and she takes voting seriously.

""I voted every year since I was old enough,"" she said.

She's witnessed 18 presidential elections in her first century.

And now, in her second century, there's only been one political cycle and it is one she would like to forget.

""It is the worst,"" she said, ""it is awful.""

""We were at his restaurants and he came over and talked with us,"" said Gause, ""he is a very nice man.""

Gause said she used to be a Democrat but became a Republican because its platform on family, abortion and marriage is more in line with her values.

""This is my family and we all stick together you can see that,"" she said.

She has four children and more than 32 grand children. She is the matriarch of a family that spans generations.

She's often asked what's the secret to her longevity and the answer is always the same:

""I don't have a secret,"" she said, ""I just live like everyone else I just get out and go I'm not a homebody, I don't like sitting in the chair.""

Bill, her son, said the secret to her success is her love of shopping.

She would never miss an election, not even this one, but she wants it to be over with soon.

NASA's Kepler spacecraft has discovered its 1,000th alien world, further cementing the prolific planet-hunting mission's status as a space science legend.

Kepler reached the milestone on Tuesday with the announcement of eight newly confirmed exoplanets, bringing the mission's current alien world tally to 1,004. Kepler has found more than half of all known exoplanets to date. The telescope has also spotted 3,200 additional planet candidates, and about 90 percent of them should end up being confirmed.

Furthermore, a number of these future finds are likely to be small, rocky worlds with temperate, relatively hospitable surface conditions — in other words, planets a lot like Earth. At least two of the newly confirmed planets appear to meet that description, Kepler team members say.

Those two planets, known as Kepler-438b and Kepler-442b, join six others that were added to Kepler's list in Seattle during the annual winter meeting of the American Astronomical Society. Kepler-438b orbits a relatively cool star that's 475 light-years away and is 12 percent bigger than Earth. Kepler-442b is 33 percent bigger than Earth, and is 1,100 light-years from us. [Gallery: A World of Kepler Planets]

Eight of the newly identified candidate planets appear to be between one and two times the size of Earth, and orbit in their stars' habitable zone — the area where water could exist in liquid form. Six of those candidates have parent stars that are similar to our own sun in size and temperature. However, all of the candidates require follow-up observations and analysis to verify they are actual planets.

""Kepler was designed to find these Earth analogues, and we always knew that the most interesting results would come at the end,"" Kepler mission scientist Natalie Batalha of NASA's Ames Research Center told Space.com last month. ""So we're just kind of ramping up toward those most interesting results.""

New

The New folder contains incoming conversations that have yet to be responded to by a moderator. Once a moderator responds to a conversation in new, it will move to the In Progress folder. Once a conversation leaves the New folder, it cannot be put back.

In Progress

The In Progress folder contains conversations that have been responded to by a moderator, but have not yet been archived. Unarchiving a conversation will move it back to the In Progress folder.

Archived

The Archived folder contains conversations that a moderator has deliberately archived. If an archived conversation is responded to or Unarchived it will move to the In Progress folder. Conversations in the archived folder are marked as read for all moderators.

The following message types are automatically routed to the Archived folder:

Ban Notification

Mute Notification

Highlighted

Highlighted contains all the messages that your moderation team have chosen to highlight with the Highlight action. A conversations highlighted status exists across folders, so for example you can highlight an archived message for future reference and it will also appear in the highlighted folder. Whenever viewing conversations in the Highlighted folder, we will also display an icon indicating which folder it currently resides in.

Mod Discussions

Mod discussions contains conversations that are only visible to you and other moderators of the subreddit. These conversations will always remain in the Mod Discussion folder and never appear in New, In Progress or Archived.

Nigerian authorities, who maintain tight control over humanitarian and media access to the region, have also been accused of deliberate negligence and attempting to conceal the scale of the crisis.

The UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) has categorised 4.4 million people in the Lake Chad region as ""severely food insecure"" – meaning they are in need of urgent food aid.

Toby Lanzer, UN assistant secretary general and OCHA's regional humanitarian coordinator for the Sahel, said: ""This is about as bad as it gets. There's only one step worse and I've not come across that situation in 20 years of doing this work and that's a famine.""

Boko Haram's seven-year insurgency has left Borno's farmland – which previously fed Nigeria – devastated and abandoned. This will be the region's third year without a harvest.

The hunger crisis is claiming lives even in Maiduguri, the capital of Borno state and the hub of humanitarian and security forces in the region. The city has doubled in size in two years and now hosts 2.4 million displaced people. Food prices are soaring in the markets, where it now costs $100 (£75) to buy a large bag of rice.

Lanzer said UN agencies have not had the resources necessary to tackle the crisis and has called on international donors to prevent a greater catastrophe. Of the $279m (£210m) required, only $75m has so far been secured.


Isabelle Mouniaman, head of Médecins Sans Frontières operations in Nigeria, said MSF has been raising the alarm in northern Nigeria for two years and UN organisations have failed to respond.


""We've been calling to the UN, to the headquarters of Unicef, WFP [World Food Programme], OCHA and their response has been 'Yes, we're doing this and that'… But you cannot just be satisfied to say you built X number of latrines, delivered X bags of food when people are dying. It's not enough,"" Mouniaman said.


""The Red Cross is doing their job, MSF is doing their job, but the vast majority of humanitarian organisations are failing in their responsibility towards the crisis in Borno.""


This is about as bad as it gets. There's only one step worse ... and that's a famine Toby Lanzer, UN assistant secretary general

International aid agencies have focused on Maiduguri's overstretched camps, but more than 80% of displaced people in the city, around 1.9 million people, are living among the community, the vast majority without access to food aid or medical support.

The most desperate crisis is unfolding outside Maiduguri, where aid agencies fear hundreds of thousands of people are trapped, cut off by Boko Haram and the military operation against them. As the Nigerian army clears more of these areas, the true scale of the crisis is only just becoming clear; those who have escaped tell of watching children die from hunger and being prevented from calling for help.


Mouniaman said: ""We're talking about areas in which 39% of children have severe acute malnutrition. This is a really, really dramatic situation. In my whole MSF career – since 1999 – I've never seen anything like it.""


In June, a humanitarian convoy reached Bama, Borno state's second largest city. It was recaptured by the Nigerian army in March 2015, but the 37-mile journey (60km) from Maiduguri is still considered too dangerous to make without military escort because of Boko Haram attacks and landmines.

They found Bama destroyed and a camp of about 30,000 people, mostly women and children. Many were starving. MSF found the graves of 1,233 who had died in the camp, 480 of whom were children. More than 3,000 severely malnourished people were evacuated by the state governor to Maiduguri for emergency treatment. Several died en route.


The Guardian was refused entry to Bama by the Nigerian military on security grounds. But Maj Gen Leo Irabor, who leads the military operation against Boko Haram in the region, said hunger in the Bama camp was ""relative"".

257032,False,1024,"They're just small, beige cardboard rectangles tied to a chain link fence, two of the most innocuous, everyday objects imaginable.

They almost look like price tags — and in a way, that's exactly what they are. In this case, though, the cost is a human life, as each toe tag bears the name of a victim of gun violence:

Kelvin Davis. Tyrone Wells. Pebo. Day Day. Malcolm Lassiter.

On a recent day, the sight was enough to tear open Kathleen Cooper's heart.

""Behind every toe tag, there is a broken parent, cousin or friend,"" Cooper, a youth mentor with the Delta Sigma Theta sorority, told a group of kids who attended a daylong summit on teen violence at the museum. For her, to name the victims of gun violence she knows would be to leave someone out.

""There have been so many,"" she said. ""Behind every makeshift shrine there is someone who is grieving. I have seen the effects that guns have had on our generation. We live in a world that has become desensitized to needless violence.""

But she added: ""These names also give me strength. Even though I've lost people, we have to go on living our lives and dreaming our dreams. We owe that to the people who didn't make it.""

The fence, which is on display at the Reginald F. Lewis Museum of Maryland African American History & Culture through Jan. 8, is backed by a wall the color of blood. A piece of yellow crime scene tape is draped over the links. The museum staff has placed in front of the fence the poignant tributes commonly found at scenes where people have been killed: teddy bears, white candles, bouquets of flowers, a heart-shaped stuffed pillow.

Baltimore ranks as one of America's most lethal cities. One in three people shot in Baltimore dies, a recent Baltimore Sun investigation into gun violence across the country found. That dubious distinction is shared by Washington and New Orleans.

Meanwhile, homicides have spiked. In Baltimore, more than 260 people have been killed so far this year, 85 percent by shooting. Last year, 344 people were killed, 300 by gunfire.

Part art installation and part roadside memorial, the fence accompanies the museum exhibit ""Kin Killin' Kin."" In the two weeks that it has been on view, it has elicited a visceral response from visitors who are invited to attach to the fence the names of their family members, friends and acquaintances who have been shooting victims.

Tay, a.k.a. ""40."" JoJo. Josh. Jolley. Marquis. Don the Bon.

Charles Bethea came up with the idea for the fence in 2013, when he was chief curator of Chicago's DuSable Museum of African American History. The DuSable was about to host a ""Kin Killin' Kin,"" a provocative touring art exhibit by Ohio-based artist James Pate. Bethea, who now has a similar job at the Lewis, later arranged for Pate's exhibit to come to Baltimore.

Pate tackles the crisis of urban homicides through a series of charcoal drawings that portray young African-American men committing violent acts. Instead of street clothes, Pate's subjects wear Ku Klux Klan-style robes. The artist has said his series was inspired by conversations in the community comparing the consequences of gang- and drug-related shootings to the devastation wrought by the Klan.

As he put it when the exhibit opened: ""Through this work, I'm throwing a tantrum.""

Bethea thought that inviting visitors to memorialize the victims of gun violence on toe tags would drive home the immense toll exacted on the local population. In Chicago, the fence wrapped around all four walls of the gallery.

""Initially, we bought two boxes of toe tags that each came in quantities of 500,"" Bethea said of the Chicago exhibit. ""But during the course of the exhibition we began to run out. We had to buy a third box and then a fourth. By the time the exhibit closed, we could not see the fence for the toe tags that covered it.""

The fence at the Lewis is smaller, roughly 4 feet high by 12 feet wide. Many of the metal links remain uncovered. But more toe tags go up every day.

Justis. Jamal Ross. Alonzo Gladden. Razor. Michael Bates.

In her 37 years, Kalicia Butler-Hutchins has crossed paths with so many victims of gun violence that she has lost count. But it was the shooting she witnessed as a girl in Philadelphia in 1988 that hit her the hardest.

Bernie Sanders is the oldest candidate in the 2016 race for US president. If he makes it all the way to the White House, he'd be the oldest president in the history of the United States. The 74-year-old is the longest serving Independent in the US Congress. Sanders had never registered as a Democrat, and Hilary Clinton was considered by many as the favourite to win. So when he announced his run for the Democratic nomination, many pundits and pollsters thought he stood no chance.


Yet, the self-described ""Democratic socialist"" senator from Vermont has been attracting some of the biggest campaign crowds of any candidate. He's inspired countless hashtags and memes. He's raising a lot of money for his campaign, mostly through small online donations. On social media people engage with Sanders' posts more than any other candidate. Some are even getting Bernie tattoos.


He continues to surge in the polls and is winning the support of young Democrats along the way. He recently won the New Hampshire primary with the support of 83 percent of voters ages 18-29.


Sanders' campaign is focusing on income and wealth inequality, free college tuition, racial justice, getting big money out of politics, a single-payer health care system, a $15 minimum wage and guaranteed sick time and medical leave for workers.


Bernie Sanders' bold ideas has generated enough support for him that he is no longer considered a long shot for winning the Democratic nomination. But is the popularity and support of young people enough to put him on the ticket?

255494,False,1024,"Matthews, a native of Scottsdale, Ariz., now looks to become the first American-born player selected No. 1 in the NHL Draft since Patrick Kane was chosen by the Chicago Blackhawks in 2007.

It isn't every day you see an 18-year-old prodigy take his talents overseas and dominate against many NHL-caliber players the way Auston Matthews did this season for Zurich in National League A, Switzerland's top professional league.

The 6-foot-1, 210-pound left-handed center is No. 1 on NHL Central Scouting's midterm list of international skaters eligible for the 2016 draft on June 24-25 in Buffalo, N.Y. Goran Stubb, the NHL Director of European Scouting, is in the process of finalizing the last international ranking to be released next month on NHL.com.

Many think that if Matthews was born 48 hours earlier, making him eligible for the 2015 draft, he might have given Massachusetts native Jack Eichel a run for his money as the top American-born player selected.

Eichel went No. 2 to the Buffalo Sabres after Connor McDavid was chosen No. 1 by the Edmonton Oilers.

While Matthews performed well against men this season, finishing second in voting for National League A most valuable player, Eichel has also proven to be no slouch in his rookie season in the NHL.

That raises an interesting question: Are Matthews and Eichel more similar or different in their approach and style to the game?

""We're both pretty big guys and we like to have the puck on our stick; we're both power forwards,"" Matthews told NHL.com. ""I think the style of our game might be a little bit different. Jack is obviously an unbelievable skater. I've never seen somebody skate like him. He has a great shot and is really powerful. I kind of am a little bit quicker in the corners and stuff with my hands. I try to use my hands and vision a lot.""

David Gregory, who has evaluated prospects for Central Scouting the past 15 years, saw plenty of Matthews last season with USA Hockey's National Team Development Program and followed the path of Eichel during his Hobey Baker Award-winning season at Boston University.

""I guess it's a little like asking me to compare Rembrandt and Picasso,"" Gregory said. ""They both make your art gallery better.""

Eichel and Matthews teamed up for the United States at the 2015 World Junior Championship. Eichel, who was captain, had one goal and four points in five games. Matthews, the youngest player on the U.S. roster, had one goal and three points in five games.

Video: WPG@BUF: Eichel beats Hutchinson for the lead

""Where Jack and Auston are similar is that they are both great on their edges,"" NCAA hockey analyst Dave Starman said. ""They are both great with the puck wide of their body; they glide fast. Even when they're not moving their feet, they're so strong and so good on their edges they generate a lot of speed even without their feet moving.""

Left wing Matthew Tkachuk, No. 1 on NHL Central Scouting's midterm ranking of North American skaters eligible for the draft, has skated alongside each player.

""They are both really competitive and have the puck on their stick the whole game,"" Tkachuk said. ""They are fast, hard to play against, and along the boards they're going to come out with the puck. Auston seems to have the puck glued to his stick and Eichel has straight-away speed. He's probably the fastest I've ever seen from blue line to blue line.""

Eichel had 38 goals and 87 points in 53 games for USA Hockey's Under-18 NTDP in 2013-14. Matthews had 55 goals and 116 points in 60 games for the U-18 NTDP in 2014-15.

Danton Cole coached each player at the USA Hockey program in Plymouth, Mich.

""From a physical standpoint they're both very similar, but it's a different-type game,"" Cole said. ""People have seen Jack play now and aren't surprised anymore with the power he plays with. With Auston, I don't want to say he's more finesse, but maybe more of a cutter, whereas Jack is more power.

""But they're big centers who play at a real hard pace and what's very similar is that they each have a competitive burn to succeed at all costs.""

Some see Eichel as a two-way power forward who produces points and Matthews as a two-way skilled forward who produces points. Others believe Eichel is more dominant in open ice, but Matthews is more of a force in tight quarters. Either way, a team can't go wrong.

256929,True,1014,"We can be made anonymous by too many possessions. Rather than being defined by them, we become overwhelmed by them. Lost among them; uncertain of who we are without them and so, dependent on them for identity and security.

We are socially engineered into believing we are nothing without our possessions. That the clothing we wear or the music we listen to or books we read or even the colors we paint the walls in our homes define us. In all of this sweeping mad consumerism, we ignore that we were made for so much more than to own things. This other side, the more important side, our spiritual, philosophical, searching side is underdeveloped, left un-nurtured in the pursuit of things.

However our hearts are not made light by owning. We can become wearied, worn down and even joyless. Burdened by all of our things that we buy to enable us to ignore the deeper, pressing questions of who are we really. Why are we here. Enable us to ignore that we all are born with nothing and we all die with nothing eventually.

My grandmother Leona died with nothing. I don't mean she was a poor woman though; neither was she a materially wealthy woman but she was rich in love and generosity. Her spirit was beautiful and rich. Ridiculously rich in all she gave to others. She lived on very little and all her concern was for other people. She didn't give from her ""extra"" store, she gave what she often couldn't manage to give. When she died, there wasn't anything to divide up. It had mostly been given away. She had nothing to leave but the memory of the richness of her gentle spirit. What a beautiful legacy.

So, what if we let it all go? What if we allowed ourselves to live as free beings unbound by possessions? Would we know who we are if we found ourselves living in an ""empty room""? Would we know how to describe and define ourselves?


I don't want to be remembered as ""Wow, she sure had a lot of clothing!"" or ""Colleen sure had a huge collection of books, remember?"" I don't want people to smile ruefully and sum me up in these tidy little sentences. I want so much more and so much less. I want to be able to stand in an empty room and know who I am. Quietly, confidently, gently, richly know.

I want to live my life as the woman in the empty room. But also as a woman whose heart and mind and spirit are unbearably, unfathomably, disgustingly rich.

There is a quote by Steve Kellmeyer stating that, ""We can not accept an expensive gift when our hands are full of cheap baubles. We must empty our hands so as to accept the rich gift that is offered.""

Consider what ""cheap baubles"" could mean. We live our lives with our hands full of these and grasping for more, rarely satisfied or sated because these things do not satisfy. They do not sate. More creates a hunger for more. We become insatiable. Filling ourselves up until the very last thing we can do is give. There is no abundance or freedom to be found in owning, only in letting go.

We all perhaps have our own interpretation of cheap baubles that hold us back from growth and grace. Mine includes possessions, the idea of ownership, all the distractions of the world we live in, labels and definitions, opinions and expectations -- both our own and those of others about and for us.

These little trinkets fill our hands and rooms. When I think about ""the empty room,"" I not only think material goods. I think what if we were to also let go of everything else as well and then simply, quietly and graciously accept the richest of gifts on offer.

The God-given gift of who we are.

Who we are has nothing to do with what we have or don't have. It has nothing to do with how other people view us. Who we are is not what we do or what we know. It is not what we have accomplished.

We are who we are even when everything else is stripped away. When we don't have a penny to our name. When we don't have a job that makes it easy for others to label us. When we don't write or paint or draw or have any skill in any area what so ever. We are who we are when we are ill. When people leave and abandon us. When our names are dragged through the mud. We are who we are when every one is against us. When there is not one friendly face to be seen anywhere.

When wealth, beauty, health, and ability have been taken away from us, we still have immeasurable worth.

259519,True,950,"As much as we've enjoyed this late-season version of the Leafs with their new dose of youth, the fact remains that this is a team sitting thirtieth in a league of thirty. Whether this iteration of the roster would operate at that level if given the whole year is probably debatable, but as Mike Babcock has even alluded to recently, you have to be careful about buying too much into this kind of short-term success we've seen in the last week or so.

But even with all that in mind, we can still take look at some of these kids – a few now approaching the 15-game mark – to see how they've been performing to date, both production-wise and in terms of pushing play in the right direction. As we all know, these waves can, in fact, die, so it's good to look at who's been for real.

Perhaps the best story of this Leafs youth movement since the deadline is that of Connor Carrick. When Toronto pulled the trigger on the Winnik trade last month, most of the early response was ""Yes, another draft pick"", referring to the second-rounder they picked up, but we then quickly learned that the Leafs were pretty high on Carrick and pushed to have him in the deal. He was no throw-in.

A glance at Carrick's career numbers at first probably suggested to many of us he's a project-type prospect, as he's plugged away for most of the last two years at the AHL level after breaking in with the Capitals in 2013. And as we've come to learn with someone like T.J. Brennan, even with strong offensive numbers, breaking out of the AHL can be impossible for some, especially defencemen. But that's more of a cautionary tale, and considering Carrick is still a youngster, his future is obviously more wide open. He's actually a month younger than Morgan Rielly.

Considering all of this, it's been somewhat surprising to see Carrick get such a good look with the big club right away. But the looks of things early on, it was the right call.

Now that we've had some time to evaluate the trade, it seems the Leafs were smart to key in on Carrick, as he was sort of a victim of circumstance with the Caps, a team in prime contention and loaded with depth on the blue-line for the long term. With a rebuilding team in Toronto he can immediately factor into their plans, and so far he's shown why with Babcock and his crew giving him plenty of opportunity already.

In his audition with the Leafs (that will take him through the rest of the schedule), Carrick has already nabbed a pair of goals and assists through twelve games. While those obviously aren't eye-popping numbers, it's still an impressive 27-point pace over an entire schedule for a guy who's tasked with about 15-16 minutes per night.

Carrick's underlying numbers have been strong as well, as he's been clipping along at 55% in terms of score-adjusted Corsi For, also good for +2.3% relative to his teammates when he isn't out there. Keep in mind he's spent the majority of his time at even-strength alongside Gardiner, perhaps the Leafs' best play-driver, but his numbers overall have looked fine.

Again, it's early, and these numbers are through 15 games this season (including three with the Capitals), but it's clear so far that Carrick is no anchor, or at least he hasn't shown to be yet. At the very least, it's hard to say he isn't a strong upgrade on the blue-line compared someone like Roman Polak, a player who has almost zero offensive upside and carries the unfortunate tag of ""defensive defenceman"" (usually just a nicer name for someone who gets hemmed in their own zone all night). Carrick has some nice puck skills, and as his experience in the NHL grows, his reads and overall offensive instincts should only get better.

Given where the Capitals and Leafs are in terms of contention and organizational depth, the deal that sent Carrick to Toronto last month should be looked upon as a move that made sense for both clubs. And who knows, maybe Lamoriello finds another way to add to the defence corps and push him down the lineup before next season. But for now, management, the coaching staff, and fans alike should all be pleased with how he's turned out so far given his place on the roster.

Day 22

The day started with Sean Kenniff and the remaining ex-Pagongs expressing their disbelief about Gretchen Cordy's blindside ouster at the last Tribal Council.

"" Today is, like, Day 22. We had a vote last night, which is always pretty beat. Always puts us in a pretty somber mood. But last night was a very strange vote. "" – Sean Kenniff

"" Last night, it looks like there was a conspiracy, and maybe I'm being paranoid and I didn't want to believe it, but four people from Tagi voted for Gretchen, I think. "" – Jenna Lewis

"" You know, the bloodbath has begun, you know. People have started taking it a different way, 'cause there's really no good reason other than strategy to vote Gretchen off. "" – Sean Kenniff

"" I really don't know what happened last night. At first sight, it looks like they just picked Gretchen off. "" – Gervase Peterson

On the other hand, the Tagi Alliance did not have regrets about getting rid of Gretchen, since they saw her as a legitimate threat.

"" It was my idea to get rid of Gretchen because I... I thought that she was going to be the next leader. "" – Rudy Boesch

"" She had to go because she... is bright and, uh, is strong and she was a threat. "" – Richard Hatch

"" This is a game; don't take it personally. You know, if people came here to make, you know, bosom buddies and, you know, lifelong friends, they should've gone to summer camp. "" – Kelly Wiglesworth

While fishing, Jenna Lewis invited Kelly Wiglesworth and Susan Hawk to an all-female alliance to get rid of the seemingly lazy males, though the two were non-committal, since they felt secure with their pact with Richard Hatch and Rudy Boesch.

"" I think, really, if it happens again, then you can say for sure there's an alliance, but if it does, I'm more determined than ever to bust that plan up and still kill them all and win, you know. As far as Pagong, we are now four. They are now five. They do have a voting bloc on us whether we see it or not and they can pick us off one by one. My best strategy is to bond with the women and try to hold on to the women's vote as long as I can. "" – Jenna Lewis

"" The women seem to be getting along well because the women are all workers. Actually, I like Jenna better than I thought I would. I thought she would drive me wild and she doesn't, so... "" – Susan Hawk

"" I do see the women versus men vote continuing on in Rattana. As far as my three votes, top-- they're all men. I see women go out, get the crab traps. The women fix the hut. We're carrying the weight of the team. Maybe that's unfair, but that's how I see it. "" – Jenna Lewis

"" As far as the women becoming an alliance, there's a chance that the girls might want to have an alliance after there's a few more guys knocked off. If they do, I'll just lead on with them like, ""Yeah, that's a good idea."" But as far as the women forming an alliance and making one, no. It ain't gonna happen. I already got mine. I like mine. "" – Susan Hawk

Hunger pains struck hard on Colleen Haskell and Kelly, while Rudy and Sue squabbled over food rations. But not letting his tribe down, Richard returned with a net full of fish. However, Greg Buis felt threatened by him.

"" We're all hungry and we're low on energy, and there's still no one else providing any food except for Rich. And we're having to ration the rice. "" – Kelly Wiglesworth

"" Having nine people, it's, uh... everything gets smaller again. The rice pot got smaller, the sleeping quarters got smaller. "" – Rudy Boesch

"" I wish some of the other people would start conserving a little more... people that are being pigs. I'll only eat one bowl at a sitting. I'm planning on staying until the end, so I really want to have something for the last couple of days. "" – Susan Hawk

"" We have our fisherman; it's Rich. That's Rich's job. "" – Gervase Peterson

256990,True,622,"The JSC Russian Aircraft Corporation MiG has presented the first batch of MiG-35 multi-purpose warplanes. Flight tests of the multipurpose plane will begin in 2016.

The MiG-35 has a necessary set of avionics enabling the use of all means of currently available air weapons against aerial, ground and surface targets. It also had a single or a double seat option which was previously assigned to specialized training and combat aircraft.

Today, the corporation has been working on the preparations for the production launch of the new generation 4 ++ fighters.

""We have done a lot to increase the life of the aircraft and to reduce the cost of its operation, which is essential for the light fighter. An additional competitive advantage of MiG-35 is the possibility to use the exploitation of MiG-29 infrastructure. We hope that the MiG-35 will go into Russian Aerospace Forces in the period of 2018-2020,"" the General Director of Corporation MiG, Sergei Korotkov said.

A deep development of the MiG-29 family, the advanced jet can simultaneously lock on to 10 targets and can engage up to six of them. In contrast with its predecessors, the MiG-35 has made significant evolutionary steps:

• It carries more weapons;

• Flight costs 2.5 times less;

• Pilots use helmet imaging systems;

• The plane carries more fuel and can participate in air refueling as both ""recipient"" and ""donor"";

• The MiG-35 is equipped with a very sophisticated electronic warfare system and an anti-missile system;

• It has a range of 5th generation aircraft characteristics etc.

""The contract for the R & D work is in progress. We have carried out the first stage of this project — which is the technical part. It has been protected and accepted by the Ministry of Defense. That is why we go to the part of the contract, which was signed by the Ministry of Defense.

Today the plane, located here, has passed all stages of assembly and this year it will be compiled and presented to the customer a summer trial,"" said Korotkov.

The expert further said, ""Even today, it is made from the fifth-generation features such as stealth and multi-functionality. There is a specific requirement for the cabin and aerodynamic device in which the pilot is seated.""

The aircraft can reach speeds of Mach 2.23 and fly as high as 19,000 meters. In addition, the aircraft can carry a full range of existing and prospective aircraft weapons.

""It simultaneously captures 10 targets and can strike four to six targets at the same time,"" Korotkov said.

The jet is armed with a 30mm gun, air-to-air, air-to-surface, anti-ship, anti-radar missiles, rockets, bombs and aerial mines. The MiG-35 aircraft was first presented internationally during the Aero India 2007 air show.",0.559024720451952,0.7590247204519519,-0.1,-0.1
257010,True,593,"Jake Shields today admitted to taking a banned diuretic supplied by a friend prior to UFC 150.

Shields (30-7-1), 36, spoke to the Nevada State Athletic Commission via telephone while seeking a license to fight Brian Foster (22-6) at WSOF 17 on Saturday in Las Vegas. Fighters who are older than 35 are required to appear before the commission.

Shields was granted a conditional license pending the completion of his pre-fight medical paperwork, which lacks a clean MRI and hepatitis-B test. His fight headlines WSOF 17, which takes place at Planet Hollywood in Las Vegas. The main card airs on NBCSN following prelims on MMAjunkie.

Open records laws in Colorado prevented the state's athletic commission from disclosing the banned substance for which Shields tested positive following a victory over Ed Herman at UFC 150, which took place in Denver on Aug. 11, 2012.

Shields announced he had taken a banned substance and was suspended six months by the Colorado Department of Regulatory Agencies' Boxing Commission, which oversaw the event. But the fighter declined to give additional details about the substance, and the commission could not disclose it.

Speaking before the five-member commission, Shields today said he was given the substance by ""someone I know through another fighter"" and took it to help him cut weight for the fight, which initially was a win but later changed to a no-contest.

Asked to elaborate on the diuretic he took, Shields said, ""I don't really know too much about it, to be honest.

""Obviously it was a mistake, and I served my suspension,"" he added.

Shields said he didn't remember whether he had been required to disclose any substances he was taking prior to the fight. In Nevada, pre-fight medical paperwork asks fighters to disclose any medications or substances they've taken in the previous two weeks.

""I learned from my mistakes,"" he said. ""I definitely don't want to go through what I went through before.""

Shields was also grilled about his role in an infamous brawl in 2010 under the now-defunct Strikeforce banner that led to a fine and 90-day suspension. Shields explained to the commission the circumstances surrounding the incident, which resulted in an in-cage melee between his camp and Jason ""Mayhem"" Millerz. The commission sought assurance that there would be no similar situation in Nevada.

Shields pledged not to run afoul of the NSAC. He said he would review the commission's list of banned substances and review the commission's policy on unsportsmanlike conduct.

Shields said he is in the process of getting his medical paperwork updated and will submit the necessary forms for licensure.

259434,True,428,"State labor law exempts federal, state or municipal employees from minimum wage requirements, but Mr. Cuomo's office said he would act on his own through his Division of Budget, directing the initial wage increases taking effect at the end of year. He would also seek to change the labor law in the coming legislative session, which begins in January, to prevent future governors from using executive powers to roll back the wages. Mr. Cuomo will be up for re-election in 2018, at the end of which the $15 rate will be put into effect in New York City.

The job categories affected by the plan include lifeguards, office assistants and custodial staff, some of which are seasonal. Wages in New York City would be raised first, administration officials said, because of its higher cost of living.

The notion of a statewide $15 minimum wage for all employees, public and private, has faced resistance from Republicans in Albany, and some conservative fiscal groups, who warn it would be disastrous for the state's economy and job growth. On Tuesday, Senator John J. Flanagan of Long Island, the Republican leader in the State Senate, had no comment on the governor's decision.

Mr. Cuomo's announcement was met with an enthusiastic response from labor leaders like George Gresham, the president of 1199 S.E.I.U., the nation's largest health care workers union, who applauded the governor's action. Mr. Gresham said it could potentially set a $15-an-hour standard of pay for tens of thousands of the union's home-care workers, ""who do this important work, but who are not necessarily state employees.""

The announcement prompted the city's public advocate, Letitia A. James, to call for a $15 minimum wage for city employees. A spokesman for Mayor Bill de Blasio, a fellow Democrat and frequent sparring partner of Mr. Cuomo's, noted that the city had already promised its lowest paid workers more than $12 an hour in 2016, while the governor's plan would accelerate past that level only at the end of 2017.",0.8467724480122312,0.8467724480122312,0.0,0.0
255420,True,643,"It can happen to anyone at any time. One minute you're feeling an indescribable vibrancy and next an emptiness. It has sidelined the most talented cuppers in the field for minutes; hours in more severe cases. We are talking about the world of professional coffee tasting and it's most common ailment–palate fatigue!

Professional coffee tasters, like our own Paul Massard and Stormin' Norman, put their taste buds on the line every day by cupping coffee for hours. With the daily cupping process come hazards and risks like burnt tongues, self-inflicted tongue bites and worst of all, palate fatigue.

What is palate fatigue?

Also known as taste bud exhaustion or sensory enervation, palate fatigue occurs when tasting a multitude of comparable products consecutively. In the realm of coffee, palate fatigue often strikes during the cupping process. During a cupping, slurping and slurping for hours on end could take a toll on your ability to distinguish between the different flavor notes of coffee.

Why does palate fatigue happen?

Many believe that palate fatigue occurs when your nose and taste buds are simply overworked. But researchers believe otherwise. Their theory is that your brain, not the sensory receptors on your tongue, becomes fatigued with similar sensory information. This is a more solid theory because our brains function like computers. When we experience something with our senses, it sends a data signal to the brain. The brain then decodes the data into a sensory profile we can then experience. When multiple similar data signals are sent in rapid succession, the brain begins to mix up the signals and creates false readings (AKA palate fatigue).

Are there other types of palate fatigue?

As a consumer, you've probably experienced a condition very similar to coffee palate fatigue at your local department store's fragrance section. After sniffing several different fragrance cards, they all start to smell the same. This is a form of palate fatigue that affects the nasal palate (it just so happens that coffee is the palate cleanser to smell when trying on perfumes. What a coincidence!).

How does one prevail against palate fatigue?

The simple answer is to just take a break from tasting–give your brain a chance to clear its cache.

If you don't have the luxury of time, do what the pros do and employ a palate cleanser.

Lastly, as any athlete will tell you, the best way to prevent exhaustion is through conditioning and endurance. The most physically fit palates often belong to Q graders and chefs. This is because experts have spent years conditioning their palates with High Volume Taste Training (or HVTT).

Palate fatigue knows no bounds; the key is to stop it before it (for lack of a better term) leaves a bad taste in your mouth. Be prepared! Remember to do as the pros do–rest, cleanse or prevent palate fatigue all together by employing a little HVTT.

256796,True,750,"WASHINGTON -- Arkansas passed a religious freedom bill on Tuesday that is similar to an Indiana law that has faced national backlash for legalizing discrimination against lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people.

The bill cleared the Arkansas Legislature and now heads to the governor's desk, where it is expected to be signed. Like the Indiana law, the Arkansas legislation allows a person who feels his or her exercise of religion has been ""substantially burdened"" to cite that argument as a claim or defense in a private lawsuit. The legislation also grants corporations the right to religious freedom. This language is not in the federal Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA), and critics say it could be used to override existing anti-discrimination protections.

""The Arkansas and Indiana bills are virtually identical in terms of language and intent,"" said Sarah Warbelow, legal director at the Human Rights Campaign. ""They place LGBT people, people of color, religious minorities, women and many more people at risk of discrimination.""

Indiana Gov. Mike Pence (R) defended his state's law on Tuesday, calling for a legislative fix that would clarify that the law does not allow businesses to discriminate. Earlier in the week, Arkansas lawmakers also tried to head off concerns about that state's bill, approving language that says ""the General Assembly finds that it is a compelling governmental interest to comply with federal civil rights laws.""

However, according to Eunice Rho, advocacy and policy counsel at the ACLU, federal civil rights laws have no explicit protections for LGBT people, and this legislative finding -- while helpful -- is not part of the law. ""If the Arkansas Legislature is serious about preventing discrimination, they need to write it into the actual code,"" she said.

""We would like to see both Indiana and Arkansas adopt language clarifying that the state RFRA cannot be used to undermine federal, state or local non-discrimination laws,"" Warbelow said.

During Monday's committee hearing, some lawmakers raised concerns about the bill being inconsistent with federal and state RFRA laws when it comes to protecting civil rights. Some proposed a simple solution: adding a non-discrimination disclaimer to the legislation.

""It's not a philosophical debate with me at this point. I think we're going well beyond the other states,"" said state Rep. Camille Bennett (D), who ultimately voted against the bill.

But the bill's author, state Rep. Bob Ballinger (R), said its language was staying put, and that it would be too confusing to try to define what constitutes discrimination.

""If that means that you can force somebody who has deeply held religious beliefs to engage in some activity that violates their deeply held religious beliefs, and that the state has the right to force them into doing it, I can't say that I do agree with that,"" he said.

Arkansas is about to enter the same minefield that Indiana has been trapped in since Pence signed his religious freedom bill last week. In Indiana, major companies like Twitter and the NCAA, as well as celebrities like Apple CEO Tim Cook and Miley Cyrus, have spoken out against the law.

In Arkansas, both Walmart and Acxiom, a big data company, have spoken out against the legislation. The Democratic mayor of Little Rock also warned Gov. Asa Hutchinson (R) on Tuesday that ""any piece of legislation that is so divisive cannot possibly be good for the state of Arkansas and its people.""

But Hutchinson appears unfazed by these concerns. Last week, he vowed that he would sign the legislation: ""Arkansas is open for business, and we recognize and respect the diversity of our culture and economy,"" he said in a statement.",0.8062224084368119,0.8062224084368119,0.0,0.0
258649,False,1024,"Gates are placed on pipes to allow redstone signals to interact with Pipe Wire, and to detect whether or not items, power or liquid are flowing through the pipe. Autarchic gates can also replace Redstone Engines, allowing for much more compact pipe logic. All Gates are created with an Assembly Table, though it is possible to change an AND gate to an OR gate or vice versa by combining it with a Redstone Chipset in shapeless crafting. Some gates are among the items treated as Chips by GregTech.

Contents show]

Usage Edit

Right-clicking a pipe with a gate in your hand places the gate on the pipe. Like pipe wires, gates do not take up a block of their own, but appear as a modification of the pipe.

Shift-right-clicking the pipe with nothing in your hand breaks the gate, but not the pipe, while left-clicking the pipe breaks both. Breaking a gate in either way drops it as an item.

Right-clicking a pipe that has a gate on it brings up a UI for setting the behavior of the gate. Inputs will be on the left, outputs on the right. Clicking an input or output box cycles through the signals available for that box. Right-clicking cycles through in reverse order.(Note: If you are using the mod Morph, and are morphed as a different entity, you cannot open the UI for the gate)

The UI for Gold and Diamond gates also has a slot in each input/output pair for an item. This slot has a slash through it except when the input type is set to Items Traversing or Liquid Traversing, in which case it can be used to detect a specific item or liquid type.

Gate Quality Edit

The inputs and outputs available will depend on the type of gate. All gates can detect whether or not there is an item in the pipe and whether or not the pipe is receiving a redstone signal, and all gates can output a redstone signal. Iron and better gates can also detect and control Pipe Wire.

Gates also differ in the number of inputs and outputs they have. Plain gates have one input and one output, whereas iron gates have two inputs and two outputs. Iron gates and better, having multiple inputs and outputs, can be made as AND and OR gates, while plain redstone gates are a simple IF THEN structure.

If a gate's pipe is next to two different machines that can send a signal that the gate is listening for, the gate will perform an OR operation on those two inputs. This remains the case even for the more advanced gates that have AND variants. For example, a gate on a Wooden Waterproof Pipe pulling from a Still directly into an Iron Tank, if set to detect Tank Has Liquid, will activate if either the output side of the Still or the Iron Tank contains liquid.

259655,False,1024,"Physical realism is the view that the physical world we see is real and exists by itself, alone. Most people think this is self-evident, but physical realism has been struggling with the facts of physics for some time now. The paradoxes that baffled physics last century still baffle it today, and its great hopes of string theory and supersymmetry aren't leading anywhere.

In contrast, quantum theory works, but quantum waves that entangle, superpose, then collapse to a point are physically impossible—they must be ""imaginary."" So for the first time in history, a theory of what doesn't exist is successfully predicting what does—but how can the unreal predict the real?

Advertisement

Quantum realism is the opposite view—that the quantum world is real and is creating the physical world as a virtual reality. Quantum mechanics thus predicts physical mechanics because it causes them. Physics saying that quantum states don't exist is like the Wizard of Oz telling Dorothy, ""Pay no attention to the man behind the curtain.""

Quantum realism isn't The Matrix, where the other world making ours was also physical. Nor is it a brain-in-a-vat idea, as this virtuality was in play long before humans came along. Nor is it that a phantom other world modifies ours—our physical world is the phantom. In physical realism, the quantum world is impossible, but in quantum realism the physical world is impossible—unless it is a virtual reality—as these examples demonstrate.

5. Our Universe Has A Maximum Speed

Advertisement

Physical Realism: Einstein deduced that nothing goes faster than light in a vacuum from how our world behaves, and this has subsequently been considered a universal constant, but it isn't clear why this is the case. Currently: ""the speed of light is a constant because it just is, and because light is not made of anything simpler.""

To answer ""Why can't things go faster and faster?"" with ""Because they can't"" is hardly satisfactory. Light slows down in water or glass, and when it moves in water we say the medium is water, and when it moves in glass we say the medium is glass, but when it moves in empty space we fall silent. How can a wave vibrate nothing? There is no physical basis for light to move in empty space at all, let alone define the fastest speed possible.

Quantum Realism: If the physical world is a virtual reality, it is the product of information processing. Information is defined as a choice from a finite set, so the processing changing it must also be finite, and indeed our world does refresh at a finite rate. A supercomputer processor refreshes 10 quadrillion times a second, and our universe refreshes a trillion, trillion times faster than that, but the principle is the same. As a screen image has pixels and a refresh rate, so our world has Planck Length and Planck Time.

Advertisement

In this scenario, the speed of light is the fastest speed because the network can't transmit anything faster than one pixel per cycle—i.e., Planck Length divided by Planck Time, or about 300,000 kilometers per second. The speed of light should really have been called the speed of space.

4. Our Time Is Malleable

Physical Realism: In Einstein's twin paradox, one twin traveling in a rocket at nearly the speed of light returns a year later to find his twin brother an old man of 80. Neither twin knew their time ran differently and neither lost a heartbeat, but one's life is nearly over and the other's is just starting. This seems impossible in an objective reality, but time really does slow down for particles in accelerators. In the 1970s, scientists flew atomic clocks on aircraft around the world to prove they ticked slower than synchronized ones on the ground. But how can time, the arbiter of all change, itself be subject to change?

Advertisement

Quantum Realism: A virtual reality would be subject to virtual time, where each processing cycle is one ""tick."" Every gamer knows that when the computer is busy the screen lags—game time slows down under load. Likewise, time in our world slows down with speed or near massive bodies, suggesting that it is virtual. So the rocket twin only aged a year because that was all the processing cycles the system busy moving him could spare. What changed was his virtual time.

3. Our Space Curves

Advertisement

Physical Realism: According to Einstein's theory of relativity, the Sun keeps the Earth in orbit by curving space around it, but how can space itself curve? Space by definition is that in which movement occurs, so for space to curve it has to exist in another space, which is an infinite regression. If matter exists in a space of nothing, for that nothing to move (or curve) is impossible.

255589,True,619,"Allegri: 'Dybala must keep it simple'

By Football Italia staff

Max Allegri liked the new Paulo Dybala role to beat Genoa in the Coppa Italia Round of 16, but told Juventus off for giving the ball away.

Dybala was used as a centre-forward in the 4-3-3 formation, having been dropped for the last two Serie A games, and he contributed a goal and assist.

""We have to compliment the lads for their performance. We pressed hard and showed good intensity. In the second half, we waited for Genoa to move a little more and we finished off the game.

""it was an objective to reach the quarter-finals and the team achieved that in the best way,"" Allegri told Rai Sport after a 2-0 result, which sets up a quarter-final against local rivals Torino on January 3.

""Dybala put in a good performance, as did the whole team. We all want Dybala to get back to being Dybala, as he's an extraordinary player. He needed a good performance, but above all a goal, as it can help him find some calm and confidence, but it's not as if he ever truly lost his way.

""Dybala just has to focus on doing the simple things. He doesn't need to prove himself in every single game, as that only increases the pressure. He should play as he did tonight.

""I was satisfied with the overall performance, as we covered the pitch well and allowed Genoa nothing. Obviously, when Dybala is the centre-forward, then the box must be filled with runs from the wingers and midfielders. It's something we can test out, but in order for it to work, we need the wide men to constantly push forward.""

The Bianconeri risked conceding late on, as Andrej Galabinov had a couple of great chances and Genoa were initially awarded a penalty for Kwadwo Asamoah's challenge on Pietro Pellegri, but the referee changed his mind after viewing the incident on VAR.

""I was angry because we gave the ball away three or four times coming out of defence and with this one it was in the penalty area. If in doubt, kick it away. I wasn't angry with the referee, but rather with my players for creating that situation.""

Juventus are in the Coppa Italia quarter-final for the 11th year running, but first turn their focus towards Saturday's Serie A showdown with Roma.

""We've got two days to prepare for Roma, we'll see how the players who are carrying injuries are doing. It's a head-to-head clash and Roma still have a game in hand, so they could potentially be right up there with us.""

U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton stepped up pressure on the Libyan leader saying she was aware of talks between people close to Col. Gadhafi that had raised the ""potential"" for a transition of power.

Australian Foreign Minister Kevin Rudd told the conference Col. Gadhafi's end ""may come sooner than many of you in this room may think"".

NATO warplanes relentlessly bombed Tripoli as the rebels said they hoped to restart oil production, stopping short of giving a date.

At the United Nations, the prosecutor of the International Criminal Court (ICC) said its investigators had found evidence linking Gaddafi to a policy of raping opponents.

A possible war crimes prosecution could be an incentive for Col. Gadhafi to cling to power, but Senegalese President Abdoulaye Wade offered to help ease his former African Union ally's exit from power and appealed to him to step down.

""It is in your own interest and the interest of all the Libyan people that you leave power in Libya and never dream of coming back to power,"" Wade said during a visit to the rebel-held east Libyan city of Benghazi.

""I can be one of those who help you pull out of political life and the sooner you leave the better,"" Wade said.

Ms. Clinton declined to give details of the discussions over Col. Gadhafi's future.

""There have been numerous and continuing discussions by people close to Gadhafi and we are aware that those discussions include among other matters the potential for a transition,"" she told a news conference in Abu Dhabi.

A bipartisan group in the U.S. Congress urged President Barack Obama to use frozen Libyan government assets to pay for humanitarian aid for Libyan people caught up in the civil war.

NATO air strikes resumed in Tripoli on Wednesday night after a lull following the heaviest day of bombings since March, with new blasts shaking the city on Thursday morning and afternoon.

Rebel Oil and Finance Minister Ali Tarhouni said the Benghazi-based leadership hoped to restart production of up to 100,000 barrels a day ""soon"", without specifying a timeframe, and called for more aid, immediately.

""It is a failure if there is no clear financial commitment to it,"" he told reporters. ""Our people are dying ... So my message to our friends is that I hope they walk the walk.""

Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini told Reuters Italy would give the rebels up to 400 million euros of cash and fuel aid backed by frozen Libyan assets. Kuwait said it would immediately transfer $180-million to the rebels.

France pledged 290-million euros to the rebels in ""preferential loans.""

That pledge of assistance came at a meeting of the so-called Libya contact group, including the United States, France and Britain, as well as Arab allies Qatar, Kuwait and Jordan, which is pressing the rebels to give a detailed plan on how they would run the country if Col. Gadhafi stood down or was toppled. ""The international community is beginning to talk about what could constitute end-game to this,"" one senior U.S. official told reporters aboard U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's plane which landed in Abu Dhabi on Wednesday night.

That official listed scenarios including a ceasefire, which Tripoli has demanded include NATO and leave Col. Gadhafi's fate open.

The rebel Transitional National Council (TNC) and its Western allies have rejected Libyan government ceasefire offers that do not include Col. Gadhafi stepping down first.

""Pressure will increase""

U.S. officials on Wednesday announced delivery of the TNC's first U.S. oil sale, which they hope will get money flowing.

U.S. oil refiner Tesoro said in May it had brought 1.2 million barrels, which U.S. officials said was due to arrive in Hawaii on Wednesday on a tanker chartered by Swiss trader Vitol.

One of the highest-ranking defectors, ex-Foreign Minister Abdurrahman Mohamed Shalgham, said the rebels needed $3-billion to cover salaries and food costs for the next four months. Libyan assets in Italy could contribute to that sum, he said.

NATO defence ministers met in Brussels on Wednesday.

256356,False,1024,"Banks and politicians are complicit in the banking disaster bank in Spain – and citizens will have to pay for the consequences. It's a disgrace, angrily writes the director of Portugal's Jornal de Negócios.

The disaster of the Spanish banking sector shames the state. What brought it on was myth-building. The complicity between public and private in what amounts to a crime. The past profits earned by some, well out of proportion to the harm done to others. It was brought on by denials, by contagion, by lies. Everyone is lying. Everyone is lying to the same listeners: to the taxpayer…. Pardon: to the people.

Today we have the right to whisper about what happens behind other people's curtains. The house, after all, is mortgaged – and we, the ""Europeans"", are the ones who will pay for it. What difference is there, basically, between Greece, which lied about its public accounts, and Spanish banks, which lied about their balance sheets?

The Spanish problem resembles that of Ireland, in that it is a banking crisis, more closely than it does that of Portugal. In Portugal, none of the ten possible problems are crushing – but the country has all of them at once. In Spain the evil comes from an incestuous relationship between cajas de ahorro [savings banks] and regional political institutions, coupled with a housing bubble in which everyone had a hand – and from which everyone benefited: the banks from the loans, the building sector from the construction boom, real estate dealers through the buying and selling, the state through taxes, the parties – we know how they benefited – and the government from the growth in the GDP statistics.

The housing bubble and its effect have been plain to see for just under two years. But Spain has done everything wrong – the previous Zapatero government by putting off dealing with the issue, and the Rajoy government by swiftly losing its determination.

Mergers, disappearances, branch closures

The evil, which could have been confined to the savings banks, now risks spreading to the bigger Spanish banks (Santander, BBVA and La Caixa will not benefit from EUR 100 billion [expected from the assistance plan]). Worse, the contagion threatens the sovereign debt.

The difference between Spain and Ireland lies in the solution chosen. Ireland has nationalised the damage done by the banks by turning the banks' debts into public debt; in Spain, an attempt is being made to throw up a security cordon around the banking sector by lending €100 billion that will become public debt. With one objective: to prevent the problem of banks becoming a problem of the state.

But it is clear that these 100 billion euros are part of a Spanish bailout. And they include an austerity program, admittedly tacit, yet already on the way. And that program will place Spanish banks under the supervision of the European Central Bank.

The Bank of Spain is very far from having emerged from this affair. So much so that the Rajoy government has disavowed it, by transferring the audit of the system to the Ministry of the Economy.

European banks will earn less money that they used to; they will see mergers, disappearances, branch closures, fewer staff, less debt, fewer assets, and shrunken balance sheets. We in Portugal should know, because we are ahead of them here.

We have already said everything

Some words, indeed, on Portugal: a good student has reason to smile. The capitalisation process is coming to its end, and banks will start off the summer with equity unmatched elsewhere in Europe. It should be noted that some of it is public, some private – but this is an accounting issue that deserves another editorial.

""How do we put some of the blame game behind us?"" asked Bob Diamond, president of Barclays Bank, a year and a half ago. The question is premature. When we say that the banking sector has taken politics hostage, that's what we're talking about: republics of debtors and monarchies of creditors. Financiers who know everything and who bamboozle the politicians, who know nothing.

And both have the supreme audacity to treat those who end up paying for their mistakes as financial illiterates. Yes, those who have tunnelled out the budgets of the future, who garb themselves in austerity and drive up bankruptcies and the unemployment rolls are the same ones who accuse the rest of us of financial ignorance. Bravo.

The crisis is a banking crisis that has metastasized into a sovereign debt crisis. And it is the ""Europeans"" who are suffering from these crises. That's us. Democracy must be sick: lying to the European institutions, as was the case in Greece, is ultimately more serious than lying to the people, as is the case in Spain. The banks will be bailed.

The members of the Da Shu Clan were not resigned to let Lin Feng and his friends escape. Their ferocious, wild beasts were in hot pursuit.

""You killed my people and think you will be able to escape?!"" shouted someone furiously. That person's voice rolled in the atmosphere, hurting their eardrums.

Lin Feng and the three others landed on the ground knowing that their pursuers had caught up with them. A cloud of dust arose around them as they landed. Lin Feng shouted, ""Tang You You, kill that cultivator of the seventh Xuan Qi layer first and then we will kill the others together!""

""Alright!"" said Tang You You nodding. The four of them were ready.

Lin Feng took a gourd of Hot Unit and downed it to the last drop. His pure Qi seemed like it was boiling, it was flowing in his veins at full speed. While drinking and fighting, Lin Feng's pure Qi was gradually coming back to normal. The Hot Unit was progressively making the effects of the potions vanish.

""Die!"" shouted Tang You You when she saw someone riding a beast attack her by surprise. She transformed into an illusion and attacked that person with her fist. It seemed like a multitude of fists had appeared in the atmosphere.

That cultivator of the seventh Xuan Qi layer was astonished, his pure Qi started whistling in the air but would it suffice against Tang You You's fist? Of course not, his pure Qi was immediately destroyed and then vanished. Tang You You's fist crashed onto that person's chest, making him shake from head to foot. His blood vessels exploded, he groaned as he died with his eyes wide open.

One attack… The beautiful Tang You You only needed one punch to kill a man of the seventh Xuan Qi layer, even though she was several years younger than him. She was fast as lightning, her punches deadly. With her incredible abilities she only needed one punch…

Lin Feng admired Tang You You and felt safe with her. He made another step and moved like the wind, he raised his fist around which appeared a terrifying fire. This time, he wasn't using his strength of the Herukas, he was using his scorching hot pure Qi sun fire.

""Die!"" shouted Lin Feng furiously. His pure Qi sun fire also contained some killer energy.

""Third Xuan Qi layer and you think you can fight against me with pure Qi…"" said the opponent when he sensed Lin Feng's pure Qi sun fire. That person also raised his fist towards Lin Feng. Their fists were about to collide.

Very subtly, Lin Feng's fist changed course from his fist towards the man's chest.

""Huh?"" that person was surprised. Lin Feng didn't mind receiving his punch just so he could punch him too?

The man with the sixth Xuan Qi layer was convinced that he wouldn't get hurt if Lin Feng punched him. He was willing to take Lin Feng's challenge. There was no suspense about to it.

""Boom!""

""Boom boom!"" Two muffled sounds spreads in the air consecutively. The enemy's fist landed on Lin Feng's body, but Lin Feng hadn't died. He was, however, shaking violently. But immediately, a monstrous flame ignited on Lin Feng's body. It didn't seem like the opponent's fist was attacking Lin Feng, it seemed like his fist was drowning in fire.

""BOOM!"" A terrifying fire followed Lin Feng's arm and suddenly crashed onto that person's body, he sensed a monstrous pain spread all over. He lowered his head and saw a hole in his chest where a fire had just started. Very quickly, his entire body was covered with flames.

""Ahhhhh…….."" A blood curdling shriek spread in the air and that person died.

Lin Feng was standing there surrounded by flames. He was becoming stronger and stronger. His entire body was diffusing some fire-red lights, he looked like a fire deity.

""His pure Qi is back to normal."" thought Yun Fei Yang who was behind Lin Feng. A moment before, Lin Feng had gambled actually. He had bet that his pure Qi would get back the strength of the fourth Xuan Qi layer during the attack and it had worked. And yet, it seemed like it was still increasing….

Lin Feng moved and in a flash many bottles of Hot Unit appeared, they were those that Tang You You had just given to him.

""Kacha kacha!"" In a flash, all of them broke and a waterfall of Hot Unit liquor appeared in the air. Lin Feng opened his mouth and started inhaling with his mouth in an insane way.

256034,True,784,"When should we be alarmed about so much wealth in so few hands?

The Great Recession and its anemic recovery only deepened the economic inequality that's drawn so much attention in its wake. Nearly all wealth and income gains since then have flowed to the top one-tenth of America's richest 1 percent.

The very wealthiest 400 Americans command dizzying fortunes. Their combined net worth, as catalogued in the 2015 Forbes 400 list, is $2.34 trillion. You can't make this list unless you're worth a cool $1.7 billion.

""America's skewed wealth is one of the most critical issues of our time.""

These 400 rich people — including Bill Gates, Donald Trump, Oprah Winfrey, and heirs to the Wal-Mart fortune — have roughly as much wealth as the bottom 61 percent of the population, or over 190 million people added together, according to a new report I co-authored.

That equals the wealth of the nation's entire African-American population, plus a third of the Latino population combined.

A few of those 400 individuals are generous philanthropists. But extreme inequality of this sort undermines social mobility, democracy, and economic stability. Even if you celebrate successful entrepreneurship, isn't there a point things go too far?

To me, 400 people having more money than 190 million of their compatriots is just that point.

Concentrating wealth to this extent gives rich donors far too much political power, including the wherewithal to shape the rules that govern our economy. Half of all political contributions in the 2016 presidential campaign have come from just 158 families, according to research by The New York Times.

The wealth concentration doesn't stop there. The richest 20 individuals alone own more wealth than the entire bottom half of the U.S. population.

This group — which includes Gates, Warren Buffet, the Koch brothers, Mark Zuckerberg, and Google co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin, among others — is small enough to fit on a private jet. But together they've hoarded as much wealth as 152 million of their fellow Americans.

Many of the richest 400 Americans amassed their wealth through successful companies and innovation. But they've all benefited enormously from a system of trade, tax, and regulatory rules tipped in favor of the wealthy at the expense of wage earners.

Tax policies, for instance, routinely target income from investments at lower rates than wages from work. These rules disproportionately benefit the Forbes 400, especially those working in finance.

This dominance endures across generations. As the French economist Thomas Piketty has warned, the United States is becoming an aristocracy dominated by people who've inherited great wealth and power.

Do we want the next generation of politics to be dominated by the heirs of Amazon founder Jeff Bezos or Wal-Mart heir Jim Walton? If not, it'll take strong and strategic public policies to reverse these trends.

Raising the minimum wage so all full-time workers can make enough money to live on would be a start.

And overhauling the campaign finance system so the richest Americans can no longer dictate which political candidates will be viable is a crucial next step. In the 2016 presidential race, Bernie Sanders is the lone top-tier candidate who isn't receiving massive contributions from what he calls ""the billionaire class.""

These policies may reduce inequality, but they won't slow the concentration of wealth. Achieving that goal will require reinstituting the progressive income tax policies of previous generations. Given today's economy, this should include a wealth tax on billionaires.

America's skewed wealth is one of the most critical issues of our time. Unless we defuse this threat to our democracy, we're destined to become a society governed by the sons and daughters of today's billionaires.",0.409964578039999,0.809964578039999,-0.4,0.0

255331,True,830,"Brown: Emanuel backing 4 percent surcharge on Airbnb bills

Another week, another homeless initiative from Mayor Rahm Emanuel.

Last week, it was a pilot program to find housing for 75 homeless people camped under Lake Shore Drive viaducts.

This week, he's signing on to a proposal by Chicago aldermen to double his proposed surcharge on house-sharing businesses like Airbnb, with the proceeds to be used to provide services for the homeless.

The resulting 4 percent surcharge on the bills of house-sharing guests would initially bring in more than $2 million annually for homeless programs, with an expectation of added revenue in the future as the emerging industry grows, administration officials say.

The dedicated local revenue stream, long sought by advocates for the homeless, will be ""groundbreaking,"" the mayor promised in an interview.

OPINION

So what gives? Has Emanuel grown a heart, or is he just trying to prove there was one there all along?

I'm not sure. Politics most likely, though, to be fair, he's been pretty good on many housing issues.

The explanation might be this simple: Finding more money to help the homeless will likely help the mayor gain whatever additional aldermanic support he needs for his underlying proposal to regulate the house-sharing industry.

Emanuel said he plans to move forward in May with the ordinance, though he still faces opposition from multiple parties.

In a replay of the ""new economy"" battle playing out between taxi companies and ride-sharing services like Uber, hotel interests object on grounds that Emanuel's regulations are too easygoing on the tech-based lodging services. They contend that some of the house-sharing companies operate what in effect are unregulated hotels that unfairly compete with them.

The real estate industry also has concerns. The Chicago Association of Realtors says tenants and condo owners should be required to submit affidavits attesting they have permission from their landlords or condo associations to rent their units. The underlying point: Many apartment and condo dwellers who already house-share don't have such permission.

Airbnb is also displeased. The company argued the proposed 2 percent surcharge Emanuel unveiled in January was unfair to middle-class people renting out their homes on weekends. Doubling it to 4 percent doubles that unhappiness.

Despite those hurdles, Emanuel said: ""I have no doubt we're going to pass the ordinance.""

I have no position on the underlying Airbnb ordinance without more study.

But I think it's a great idea to direct revenue from this new industry to homeless people, given the roundabout probability the Airbnbs of the world are going to further contribute to housing displacement.

There's definitely a need for revenue. Even if the city can cobble together funding to provide housing for homeless people, federal and state budget cuts have decimated the services needed to help them stay there.

Those can include mental health treatment , substance abuse counseling and job-readiness training.

Emanuel's original proposal directed the money to homeless families. With the need to address growing homeless encampments, some funds will be switched there, he said.

Ald. Ameya Pawar (47th), who teamed with Ald. James Cappleman (46th) on the idea of doubling the surcharge for homeless services, said doing so was enough to secure his support for the Airbnb ordinance.

""I think this is a good balance,"" Pawar said.

The Chicago Coalition for the Homeless also supports the surcharge plan.

Administration officials said the mayor remains open to considering further changes based on other concerns raised by aldermen but rejects Ald. Brendan Reilly's position that the administration should scrap its proposal and instead enforce the stricter vacation rental ordinance that took effect in 2011.

After two weeks of our making nice, the mayor assures me he will do something in the coming week for which I can criticize him. I told him I look forward to it.",0.5632054043060635,0.7632054043060634,-0.2,0.0

256697,True,1015,"There used to be rhinos in North America. In fact, they originated on the continent. The earliest ones didn't look like the large, thick-skinned beasts we know today. No, if you were to wander through the humid forests of Wyoming or Utah around 50 million years ago, the closest thing to a rhino that you'd see would be a slender, pony-sized mammal that paleontologists know as Hyrachyus. And speaking of ponies, some of the earliest horses wandered the same forests – Eohippus and other horses that stood on several hoofed toes and were the size of a small dog – as well as the first tapirs.

Rhinos, horses, and tapirs are all perissodactyls. Roughly speaking, that means that they're all hoofed mammals that stand on an odd number of toes. And they weren't the only such mammals to thrive in ancient North America. Extinct perissodactyls – the ""sloth horses"" called chalicotheres and the horn-faced brontotheres – thrived on the continent, too. Together, they're a fantastic example of how many different forms can radiate from very similar ancestors. But where did perissodactyls get their start? An assortment of bones from an enigmatic animal points to an origin not in North America, but prehistoric India.

View Images A restoration of Cambaytherium by Elaine Kasmer.

About 54.5 million years ago, a little before it slammed into Asia, India was an island. And on that island lived a small hoofed mammal that paleontologists have named Cambaytherium thewissi. Exactly which lineage of mammal this little herbivore belonged to was unclear when it was first described nine years ago. Some researchers suspected that it was close to the origin of a group called anthracobunids – themselves related to elephants and manatees – while others hypothesized a closer relationship to early perissodactyls.

Thanks to a new collection of 120 tooth and jaw specimens, as well as 100 bones from the body, Johns Hopkins University paleontology Kenneth Rose and colleagues have finally figured out where Cambaytherium and its kin fit in the mammal family tree. Cambaytherium and its close relative Nakusia come out as the closest-known cousins of perissodactyls. In other words, they weren't true perissodactyls, but they were very close to the lineage that spawned the last common ancestor of the horses, rhinos, tapirs, brontotheres, and chalicotheres.

View Images Where Cambaytherium fits in the mammal family tree. From Rose et al., 2014.

These relationships are underlain by anatomy. While Cambaytherium had some features in common with the first horses and rhinos, such as fused lower jaw bones, the hoofed herbivore also shared some traits with an archaic group of hoofed mammals called phenacodontids, such as the anatomy of its teeth and a skeleton less-suited to running. This doesn't mean that Cambaytherium was the direct ancestor of the first perissodactyls. Rather, the beast embodies transitional features that give us a more detailed look at how the ancestor of the horse and rhino emerged from more archaic mammals.

Finding an animal so close to the first perissodactyls in prehistoric India also alters the scenario for how these mammals spread around the world. Between 115 and 112 million years ago, still in the Age of Dinosaurs, an island consisting of Madagascar and India split from Africa. By 88 million years ago, India broke off from Madagascar and continued northward. The isolation of these islands spurred the evolution of some weird mammals – like the recently-announced Vintana from Madagascar – but the ancestors of Cambaytherium were not among the odd spinoffs. These hoofed mammals were a more recent addition to India.

After the mass-extinction that wiped out the non-avian dinosaurs and other forms of life, 66 million years ago, India continued to drift northwards toward Asia. And as it got close, Rose and coauthors propose, the ancestors of Cambaytherium and the first perissodactyls somehow dispersed from ancient Afro-Arabia to India. Once on the big island, they continued to evolve in the confines of the island for a few million years, making India a crucible of evolutionary novelty. The island's eventual collision with Asia brought these new forms in contact with larger, interconnected landmasses where they quickly proliferated, spreading east and west, north and south, in an evolutionary dynasty that is hanging on by the barest of threads today.

259323,True,811,"Mary Barra, GM's first woman CEO offered apologies in a Congressional hearing on Tuesday, but no real explanation for the fact that the car company failed to fix a problem it knew about that endangered people's lives. A faulty ignition switch, which caused cars to abruptly shut off, shutting down all systems inlcuding power steering and air bag deployment, is known to have caused the deaths of 13 people. She did promise to investigate it, though. During the hearing, Congresswoman Diana DeGette held up one of the defective switches, and pointed out that it could have been fixed for 57 cents per car.

Documentary filmmaker Michael Moore vented his rage about GM's callousness immediately on his Facebook page. It is strong stuff, but many share his outrage over unnecessary deaths, and corporate malfeasance. Of course, it is hard to arrest the ""profit motive"" or ""runaway capitalism,"" which he cites as the real culprits, so maybe just hunt down the executives who knew full well they were putting people's lives in jeopardy.

In Moore's words:

SPONSORED

I am opposed to the death penalty, but to every rule there is usually an exception, and in this case I hope the criminals at General Motors will be arrested and made to pay for their pre-meditated decision to take human lives for a lousy ten bucks. The executives at GM knew for 13 years that their cars had a defective ignition switch that would, well, kill people. But they did a ""cost-benefit analysis"" and concluded that paying off the deceased's relatives was going to be cheaper than having to install a $10 part per car. They then covered up their findings and continued to let millions drive around with the defective part in their cars. There would be no recalls. There would only be parents and the decapitated body parts of their dead children. See the USA in your Chevrolet. In 2007 a National Highway Traffic Safety Administration official recommended a formal investigation but was overruled by others in Bush's ""business-friendly"" Transportation Department.

Only now, under the newly-configured GM -- owned, essentially, by you and me from 2009 through last year -- has the truth come out. And my guess is that it has to do with the fact that a mother now runs General Motors. A few months ago, Mary Barra, a former resident of Flint, the daughter of GM union autoworker, was named its CEO. And it looks like she isn't one of the good ol' boys. She stepped forward, announced the truth of what GM did, ordered one massive recall after another, and now is showing up to face Congress in a few hours.

The Washington Post, in an otherwise good article, blames the whole sad affair on the ""corporate culture"" at GM. What a user-friendly term! To even have to read the words ""culture"" and ""General Motors"" in the same sentence is enough to make anyone gag. No, the cause of this tragedy is an economic system that places profit above everything else, including -- and especially -- human life. GM has a legal and fiduciary responsibility to its shareholders to make the biggest profits that it can. And if their top people crunch the numbers and can show that they will save more money by NOT fixing or replacing the part, then that is what they are going to goddam well do. F*** you, f*** me, and f*** everybody they sent to their deaths. That pretty much sums up their ""culture"". They knew they wouldn't get caught, and if they did, no one would ever serve any time.

I hope someone in the Obama administration will get out the handcuffs, the SWAT teams, or the U.S. army if need be, march into GM headquarters in downtown Detroit and haul away anyone who is there who had anything to do with this. And if they already left town, hunt them down and bring them in to face justice.",0.7881797887991545,0.7881797887991545,0.0,0.0

Woods is one of the few entertainers who openly supports President Donald Trump. He is also a vocal critic of Planned Parenthood, a second Amendment enthusiast, and has repeatedly slammed ex-San Fransisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernik over his National Anthem protest.

Woods explained that there are numerous Republicans in Hollywood who choose to keep quite about politics — though he admits he is vocal about politics because has ""accepted"" his blacklisted state.

""The only reason I express my views is that I have accepted the fact that I'm blacklisted. Also I bought Apple stock in the 80's,"" he wrote.

Earlier this week, actor Dean Cain, another Republican in Hollywood who supports Trump's policies, said his vocal support for the president with people in the entertainment industry is ""immediately met with the most crazy vitriol.""

""They say things and they expect you to agree one hundred percent,"" Dean told Fox News host Tucker Carlson. ""The president is a Nazi and go 'no, I don't believe he's a racist. I don't believe he's a Nazi. I don't believe there's any collusion with Russia. And they look at me as though I'm an alien.""

On being blacklisted, Cain said he is able to find work because he's an established actor. ""But I'm sure there are some forces at work that aren't real happy that I would say these things. It can certainly affect people's work.""

Cain also said that some social media users attempted to get him kicked off of Supergirl over his pro-Trump comments.

258219,False,1024,"The American International Group, Inc.—which would be extinct were it not for a $182-plus billion bailout, and whose profits would be far lower were it not for the continuing tax breaks it receives—is pondering whether it will join a lawsuit charging unfair treatment by the U.S. government. Say what?

Yes, the AIG board is meeting Wednesday to decide whether to go forward with the suit. What's at issue? The government, the claim goes, was too tough in its terms for the bailout, charged too much interest, diluted shareholders' stake in the firm and violated the Fifth Amendment's takings clause.

The deciders are meeting as AIG's sugary ""Thank you, America"" ad campaign moves through its second week. The campaign notes that the company has repaid the direct aid of $182 billion and even made $22 billion profit in the deal. Thanks, Americans, and now bend over:


Maurice R. Greenberg, A.I.G.'s former chief executive, who remains a major investor in the company, filed the lawsuit in 2011 on behalf of fellow shareholders. He has since urged A.I.G. to join the case, a move that could nudge the government into settlement talks. [...] Some government officials are already upset with the company for even seriously entertaining the lawsuit, people briefed on the matter said. The people, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, noted that without the bailout, A.I.G. shareholders would have fared far worse in bankruptcy. [...] ""The government has been saying, 'We're your friend, we owned and controlled you and we let you go.' But A.I.G. doesn't owe loyalty to the government,"" a person close to Mr. Greenberg said. ""It owes loyalty to its shareholders."" [...] The Treasury Department declined to comment. A spokesman for the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, Jack Gutt, said, ""There is no merit to these allegations."" He noted that ""A.I.G.'s board of directors had an alternative choice to borrowing from the Federal Reserve, and that choice was bankruptcy.""

""Beginning in 2008, the federal government poured billions of dollars into AIG to save it from bankruptcy. AIG's reckless bets nearly crashed our entire economy. Taxpayers across this country saved AIG from ruin, and it would be outrageous for this company to turn around and sue the federal government because they think the deal wasn't generous enough. Even today, the government provides an ongoing, stealth bailout, propping up AIG with special tax breaks—tax breaks that Congress should stop. AIG should thank American taxpayers for their help, not bite the hand that fed them for helping them out in a crisis."" When a company accepts a taxpayer bailout to stay in business, it ought to follow the same tax laws followed by companies that aren't bailed out. In its ongoing efforts to reform corporate tax law, Congress should close this egregious loophole and prevent AIG from continuing to receive a stealth bailout every time it files its taxes.""

Absent this assistance, it is highly likely that AIG would have been broken into parts and sold to the highest private-sector bidders—and had that happened, it is highly unlikely that the company's losses would have been permitted to carry forward [for tax purposes]. By any reasonable definition, the company changed ownership: A controlling stake passed from its stockholders to the federal government. As such, AIG should have been limited in rolling over past losses. Beginning in 2008, however, the U.S. Treasury jumped in with a special ruling that the financial rescue did not constitute a change in ownership. AIG was thus permitted to preserve its pre-bailout losses on its books, and now the company is using those losses to show enormous profits and dodge the taxes it owes on the billions it is earning today. This is wrong.

Newly elected Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren released the following reaction:Along with three others who served with her on the Congressional Oversight Panel established by the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008, Warren wrote an op-ed for the Washington Post last March. They pointed out that AIG was bleeding billions in 2008 and only have survived because of the bailout that gave the taxpayers majority ownership of the company:Every bailout deal of alleged too-big-to-fail operations has had its up sides and down sides. At GM, tens of thousands of direct jobs and perhaps a million or more supply-chain jobs were saved at a time when the economy was already heading for the worst plunge since the 1930s. The collapse of the entire domestic auto industry was at risk and along with it the livelihoods of a huge chunk of America's manufacturing work force. But the rescued jobs came with a price, the halving of entry-level pay for workers and reduced benefits. Moreover, the government will sell its remaining 300 million GM shares this year or early next at a loss. If it's the same price as it sold 200",0.5920645395980069,0.7920645395980069,-0.2,0.0

They were treated to a sun-splashed day, a breezy night and a collection of characters ranging from Victor Estrella Burgos, a 34-year-old Dominican playing the best tennis of his life, to Belinda Bencic, an 18-year-old Swiss miss who won her opening match in straight sets over Daniela Hantuchova.

She is coached by Martina Hingis' mother and last year became the youngest U.S. Open quarterfinalist since Hingis.

In between was the return of two-time Key Biscayne champion Victoria Azarenka after a two-year absence. The former world No.1, down to No.36 after a series of injuries, cruised past Silvia Soler-Espinosa 6-1, 6-3.

""Coming back to a place where I have a lot of great memories, it's always nice,"" Azarenka said. ""My first big win was here, and my first win over Serena [Williams]. It took me a while to get another one after that. But I was 19 years old, to win such a big title at such a young age, it meant a lot. I think I left a pretty good mark winning here.""

She said playing here at 25 is a different experience.

""I remember when I came here and won my first two matches in a row, how excited I was,"" Azarenka said. ""I was like, 'Oh my God, I made it to the third round in Miami, and I played Anastasia Myskina.' For me, it felt like I won a Grand Slam. But, obviously, being here at 25, it feels a little bit different.""

It was a good day for the Americans. Winners included Christina McHale, Alison Riske, Jack Sock, Donald Young, Irina Falconi, Sam Querrey and Coral Springs' Sloane Stephens, who defeated Yanina Wickmayer 6-1, 6-3 in a night match.

Falconi, a qualifier ranked 100th, needed two and a half hours to eliminate Miami resident Monica Puig 7-6 (11-9), 7-6 (7-3).

Querrey won 6-4, 6-3 under the lights against Estrella Burgos, who last month became the oldest first-time ATP titlist (Ecuador Open) and first player from the Dominican Republic to win an ATP crown. Estrella Burgos has jumped from No.331 two years ago to No.55.

The oldest American tennis star, the 33-year-old Williams, was on the tournament grounds Wednesday, hitting for the first time since injuring her knee last week and withdrawing from the BNP Paribas Open at Indian Wells, California. She was still feeling pain but said when she stepped on the practice court Wednesday there was little doubt in her mind that she will be ready to go for her first match Friday night.

""I didn't think I would be doing this interview [Wednesday],"" Williams said. ""I stepped on the court and I was just like, 'I love this place.' You know, I love playing at home. I live just down the road.

""I don't feel any pressure because I have won this title a few times, so I feel good about being here. When I hit on the court today, just something about Miami, you know. I just feel so good out here. So I was like, 'Oh, this is fun.' I'm just looking forward to just enjoying myself this year more than anything.""

She had an anti-inflammatory injection last week, but other than that has just been managing the pain.

Top-ranked Williams has won 19 Grand Slams and seven Key Biscayne titles, but says she stills feels youthful.

""I don't feel old at all,'' said said.

""I think that's what keeps me in it. I always look at it and I'm like, `I have been on the tour a hundred years.' It's a joke, but, like, I definitely don't feel older. I don't feel like 33, if it's old. I definitely listen to the same music. I try to keep myself current. I say the current words like, fleek. (Laughter). I'm on top of it.''

255330,False,1024,"Monday, January 11th, 2016 will forever be equated with the day that our Aliyah ended. After ten years of building a life for ourselves, ingraining our family into a community and integrating into Israeli life, one miserable eye-opening day made us question our decision to live out our lives in Zion and take stock as to why we are really here. Whether we move back is inconsequential, what matters here is that the belief we held in the State of Israel was demolished with the reality that the land we live in is not free nor just and without major reforms it never will be for the millions of people who call this place home.

What happened to us, as I found out is not uncommon in this country. While the circumstances and specific details are different, the fact that the Israel Police overstepped their bounds and turned our lives upside down is not. At six o'clock in the morning on that day the police barged into our home, woke our children and proceeded to tear our home apart. With little explanation and a presumption of guilt they meticulously went through our home in search of illicit drugs. They flashed a warrant which gave them the legal right to do so, however were not particularly interested in respecting our property or us for that matter as they executed their duty.

During the search they sequestered me and my fourteen year old daughter, strip searched me when I had asked if I could put on some pants and proceeded to ask where our stash was. We were accused of growing a forest of marijuana and distributing it to kids in Modi'in, the city in which we have lived for the past 9 plus years. One look at our large garden and it should have been obvious right then and there that there was no growing operation, however this did not deter them. Assuming harvest season was over they poked their noses into every corner of our home, every box, every cabinet without care for the valuables which we cherished.

Upon realizing that there was not even a crumb of anything illicit, no paraphernalia even for recreational use and no evidence to substantiate their theory, they proceeded to detain me and my young daughter and brought us to the station for interrogation – or what they call investigation. There is no distinction between the two when it comes to the methods they employed. Upon entering the car they told me not to speak to my daughter and slapped me when I ignored those instructions. As stoic as she was she is still fourteen and will forever be my baby, I will always ignore those orders especially when I see her teary eyed and scared.

What occurred over the course of the next twelve hours was something out of a movie, even today it is all quite surreal. My daughter was sequestered from me and interrogated without representation. I was put in leg and arm shackles and shuffled from place to place, outside and in the station for several hours without telling me why. I was demanding that I see my daughter, where I come from you cannot simply interrogate a minor without a parent or attorney, however the more I persisted in my demands the more harsh their treatment towards me became.

I was as cooperative as I could be. Our phones and computers were confiscated and I offered them the lock codes without even being asked for them – we were not running a drug operation from our home and I had nothing to hide. However even still they acted as if there was evidence to the contrary throughout the day in an attempt to get me to confess to something that was simply not close to being true. I had asked that I be interrogated in English as my Hebrew is fair, not great – I was not. When presented with a document to sign and said I have poor Hebrew reading skills my head was smashed onto the papers with the hard table underneath and asked if that helped me in my ability to read them. When I asked for an attorney after several hours of some physical and a lot of verbal abuse I was denied this request, told that I will have time later to speak with him.

I did not even know what was going on with my daughter, had no idea where my family was or what was transpiring outside and did not know I even had a lawyer I could talk to. My wife was at the station with our oldest daughter trying to get the lead investigator to speak with the attorney she had hired that morning. The arresting officer shoved my daughter to the ground, grabbed her phone and hung up on the attorney. To say that every member of my family experienced some abuse that day is to minimize the event, no one was safe that day.

What I realized during my time in chains was that the police are either above the law or do not have any to follow. By mid-afternoon I was finally allowed to speak with my attorney, as much as his words were meant to be soothing my ordeal was ongoing and I did not take it as such. I was told that if they take me to prison that day I will have to see a judge within 24 hours and when that happens",0.7632169915429601,0.7632169915429601,0.0,0.0

The risk of a major cyberattack on the nuclear industry is rising, potentially leading to blackouts or even meltdowns, researchers say.

The 2010 Stuxnet worm's infiltration of Iran's nuclear program was the most dramatic cyberattack the nuclear sector has ever seen. But it was not the only one. In one case in 2003, the Slammer worm infected the Davis-Besse nuclear power plant in Ohio, leaving reactor core safety data unavailable for nearly five hours. In another example from 2014, hackers stole blueprints of at least two nuclear reactors and other sensitive data from Korea Hydro and Nuclear Power Co., then demanded money from the company in exchange for not releasing potentially important files.

Although the 2011 nuclear disaster at Fukushima was not the result of a cyberattack, that catastrophe nevertheless underscored what the grave consequences of disrupting a nuclear power plant can be. To shed light on what risks the nuclear industry now faces from cyber-threats, researchers at Chatham House, part of the the Royal Institute of International Affairs in London, conducted in-depth interviews of 30 nuclear industry experts and convened three expert roundtables on nuclear cyber-security over the course of 18 months.

The results, detailed on 5 Oct., were alarming, says study lead author Caroline Baylon, a research associate at Chatham House. ""I didn't expect to find as many vulnerabilities as I did,"" she says. ""The nuclear industry is not mature at all when it comes to cyber-security—it's barely starting to deal with the issue.""

""A cyberattack that takes two or three nuclear power plants offline could definitely cause major blackouts in the United States,"" says Baylon. ""And if you look at a country like France, where 60 to 70 percent of its power comes from nuclear, a cyberattack could be even more serious.""

For instance, the researchers found that the conventional belief that all nuclear facilities are ""air-gapped,"" or isolated from the public Internet, is a myth. In recent years, many nuclear facilities have developed some form of Internet connectivity so nuclear plants can transmit data to, say, the head offices of those nuclear facilities, or to government regulatory agencies. The 2003 infection of the Davis-Besse nuclear plant with the Slammer worm happened when the malware spread over virtual private networks (VPN) connecting the nuclear plant with the home laptop of an engineer working for a subcontractor.

Even when nuclear facilities are air-gapped, this safeguard can be overcome with nothing more than a flash drive. This was the most likely route by which the Stuxnet worm infected the Iranian nuclear program.

In addition, nuclear plant personnel typically do not understand cyber-security procedures, often because the procedures are not clearly written. Furthermore, nuclear plant personnel often do not regularly practice cyber-security procedures in drills.

The researchers note that the nuclear industry adopted digital systems relatively late. One reason involved regulatory restrictions; another involved the very high costs of running nuclear plants, which meant that equipment in nuclear facilities is often kept in service for decades instead of replaced regularly. Baylon and her colleagues suggest the nuclear industry's delay in adopting digital systems resulted in a lower level of cybersecurity experience than is the case in other industries. They also suggest the nuclear industry's longstanding focus on physical safety and protection may have contributed to less attention to cybersecurity.

In light of these findings, the researchers propose a number of recommendations to improve nuclear cybersecurity. For example, they suggest that governments can establish computer emergency response teams specialized in defending industrial control systems. Nuclear facilities can also anonymously share reports of cyberattacks against them in order to raise awareness of threats while protecting their reputations. The researchers also suggest that nuclear facilities promote ""good IT hygiene,"" including practices such as changing the factory default passwords on equipment, and making certain that there are manual backups for critical systems in the event of a failure.

The worst-case scenario the researchers analyzed—a cyberattack that triggered the release of radioactive material—may not be an immediate threat. ""Such an attack is on the level of states against states, such as the U.S. and Russia and the U.K, which have a sort of gentleman's agreement to not attack each others' nuclear power plants,"" Baylon says. ""Almost no state wants to open that can of worms right now, although with rogue states like North Korea, no one ever knows what they might do.""

""For me, the really scary scenario is when a well-financed terrorist group like ISIS meets a hacker-for-hire company like the kind seen in Russia that may be extremely sophisticated and not have a lot of ethics,"" Baylon says. ""We need to address the cyber-security vulnerabilities in the nuclear sector immediately.""",0.40764029861424234,0.8076402986142424,-0.30000000000000004,-0.1

258685,True,810,"The United Nations Representative for International Migration, Peter Sutherland , has warned that the common humanity of Europeans could be sacrificed by a populist anti-immigrant mood fuelled by misinformation or a lack of information.

Mr Sutherland said yesterday the disgraceful situation in the refugee camp in Calais reflected European disarray on migration and refugees.

He said while the EU had made sensible proposals, a number of states, mainly in central and eastern Europe, had refused to subscribe and participate.

""If Germany can handle 800,000 to one million refugees this year, plus 500,000 a year for the following five years, why can't France (with help from the UK) not solve the problem of 3,000 people in Calais?

""For that matter why cannot every EU country (including the UK) share fairly in the relocation of migrants from Greece and Italy in particular, and also the resettlement of refugees from Turkey, Jordan and Lebanon?""

Mr Sutherland, a former EU commissioner, was speaking at a conference on boat migrants held in UCD yesterday.

He told the conference he had visited the Calais camp two weeks ago on a day of serious disturbances.

Truly shocking

""The conditions in which the migrants were living were truly shocking. Doctors there told me of clear evidence of TB and scabies. This is a disgrace. It is also a clear example of the broader inadequacies in Europe's practical expression of its much vaunted values.""

Mr Sutherland said notwithstanding an estimated 60 per cent of the 3,000 in the camp probably being eligible for refugee status, there was a reluctance by governments to follow through, on the basis the host county would then have to grant asylum.

He said the people there remained determined ""by hook or by crook"" to make it to the UK.

""The site itself is a living reproach to European society – a desperate place populated by desperate people. There, the one shaft of light is to be found in the stream – even a tide – of volunteer helpers. These often come from micro NGOs from France, the UK and some from Ireland,"" he said.

Mr Sutherland traced the background of the people in the camp, the majority of whom have fled from war-torn countries.

""The compulsion to leave was obviously so powerful that the migrants were prepared to spend their last pennies and risk their lives in rickety boats to escape.""

Over 2,700 have drowned this year. Others have been dying for years in the Mediterranean, but it took one heart-rending photograph to bring a temporary constructive reaction.""

Catastrophe

He suggested that if people were assessed before they left north Africa, then the catastrophes that have occurred would reduce greatly in number.

He said the continuing state of affairs threatened the internal cohesion of the EU and the maintenance of European values. He argued for a common EU policy for migrants and refugees, which he said was ""indispensable"" for the improvement of the current situation.

""This policy must recognise that proximity does not create responsibility for migrants or refugees. Why should Lebanon have over one-quarter of its population made up of Syrian refugees? Or why should Turkey have 1.7 million? For that matter, why should Italy and Greece have such disproportionate numbers just because they are on the Mediterranean?

""Why did the UK agree to take less than 5,000 a year for the next few years from outside the EU for resettlement, but none from Greece or Italy for relocation from inside? Why is there no real sharing of responsibility for refugees?""

259366,True,638,"Alabama Gov. Robert Bentley issued a statement Friday night saying the water issues impacting some parts of northern Alabama were ""not a crisis,"" despite one utility advising its customers not to drink their tap water.

""Based on my current understanding, I am confident that there is no health-related crisis based on the water quality of the West Morgan East Lawrence Water Authority,"" Bentley said in a news release. ""I believe every citizen should have safe water to drink.""

The issue arose on May 19, when the Environmental Protection Agency issued a health advisory for man-made chemicals PFOS and PFOA, stating that lower concentrations of those compounds than previously thought could lead to health problems over time.

As a result, the West Morgan East Lawrence Water Authority advised its customers not to drink the water from its taps, which had been tested at concentrations above the new advisory threshold.

Bentley said that decision was made without talking to his office or other relevant state authorities.

""After consultation with the State Health Officer, Dr. Tom Miller, and the Director of the Alabama Department of Environmental Management, Lance LeFleur, it is apparent that a local decision was made which effectively turned an advisory into a regulation,"" Bentley said. ""My office, along with ADPH and ADEM were not aware that this decision was being contemplated prior to it being announced.""

Miller said the ADPH's health advisory is still in place, which recommends that expectant mothers, women who are breast-feeding or infants who use formula mixed with water consider avoiding tap water. That advisory did not recommend that the general population avoid tap water.

""The EPA's health advisory was based on concern for possible health effects due to exposures to perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) and perfluorooactanoic acid (PFOA) over a certain level during a person's lifetime and not on acute or time-limited exposures,"" Miller said. ""EPA based its decisions on laboratory studies in rats and mice as well as a review of information from groups of people known to have been exposed to PFOS and PFOA in certain areas of the country.""

Don Sims, the general manager of the West Morgan East Lawrence Water Authority, said that he did not want to tell some people that the water was safe and others that it was not.

""I would rather be over-cautious than under-cautious,"" Sims said. ""I'm not a doctor, I'm not a chemist, but when they tell one class of people the water is not safe, I don't want to be the one to say 'you drink it and you don't.'

""So I said nobody drink it.""

LeFleur said that ADEM would continue to work with the water authority to ensure safe drinking water.

""Through a strong partnership with the Alabama Department of Public Health and federal agencies, we will continue to monitor any potential hazards related to perfluorinated chemicals in drinking water in the West Morgan East Lawrence Water Authority and other water systems throughout Alabama,"" LeFleur said.",0.7908534909549512,0.7908534909549512,0.0,0.0
256907,True,680,"The United States Anti-Doping Agency informed the UFC that Brock Lesnar failed a drug test on the night he fought Mark Hunt.

The positive test, coupled with the formality of a ""B"" sample showing a similarly dirty result, means that Lesnar likely forfeits his win, part of his purse, and two years of any MMA career the professional wrestler hoped to pursue. The UFC's former heavyweight champion previously tested positive for an out-of-competition test in the lead-up to the Hunt bout. In both instances, Lesnar reportedly popped positive for clomiphene, an estrogen inhibitor typically taken at the conclusion of a steroid cycle to block the natural surge in estrogen that accompanies the unnatural surge in testosterone. It also helps the body naturally produce testosterone after a steroid cycle signals the body to stop producing much of it. Clomiphene, among other effects, helps prevent the growth of breasts in males using steroids. In women, it promotes fertility. This substance also found its way into the urine of Chael Sonnen and Jon Jones before their suspensions.

The UFC released a statement addressing the development:

The UFC organization was notified today that the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency (USADA) has informed Brock Lesnar that his in-competition sample collection from July 9, 2016, at UFC 200, has tested positive for the same substance as his previously announced out-of-competition collection on June 28, 2016. USADA, the independent administrator of the UFC Anti-Doping Policy, will handle the results management and appropriate adjudication of this case. It is important to note that, under the UFC Anti-Doping Policy, there is a full fair legal review process that is afforded to all athletes before any sanctions are imposed. The Nevada State Athletic Commission also retains jurisdiction over this matter as the sample collection was performed at UFC 200 in Las Vegas. Consistent with all previous potential anti-doping violations, additional information will be provided at the appropriate time as the process moves forward.

Lesnar looked like his old, young self in a dominant victory over Hunt after nearly five years away from the sport. He took down the Super Samoan at will in the first and third rounds, viciously pounding his face with fists, forearms, and elbows from the top position. The judges saw it unanimously 29-27 for Lesnar.

But Hunt saw this all coming. He criticized USADA for granting a waiver to Lesnar to return to competition without the usual four-month testing window preceding it. The New Zealand-born fighter battled Antonio Silva to a draw several back before results showed Big Foot used banned substances. That fight, as the fight with Lesnar will eventually do, reverted to a ""no contest."" Hunt also battled at least five other fighters besides Silva and Lesnar linked to performance enhancers during their careers through failed and dodged tests. Hunt, evidently experienced in spotting the signs in opponents, described Lesnar as ""juiced to the gills"" prior to the bout.

Lesnar joins other UFC legends, including Anderson Silva, Frank Mir, and Jon Jones, in testing positive for banned substances. The promotion instituted a stringent new screening regime administered by USADA, which not only figures to catch more malefactors but promises to punish them more, too.",0.7828592130153005,0.7828592130153005,0.0,0.0
258231,False,1024,"Editor's note: This article is adapted from the introduction to Reagan's 1968 Dress Rehearsal: Ike, RFK, and Reagan's Emergence as a World Statesman, which was published earlier this month.

Ronald Reagan turned over in bed the night of October 27, 1964, to kiss his wife Nancy good night, but he was worrying about the speech, ""A Time for Choosing,"" he had given on behalf of the Republican candidate for president, Barry Goldwater. It had been recorded in advance and was aired on national television earlier that evening. ""I was hoping I hadn't let Barry down,"" he wrote in his autobiography. The Reagans had returned home after watching the speech at the home of some friends (who later became his political supporters).

A scant two hours after going to sleep, shortly after midnight, Reagan was awakened by the shrill ring of their telephone. It was the operator from Citizens for Goldwater headquarters in Washington, D.C. She could barely contain herself, yelling, ""The switchboard has been lit up ever since you signed off. It's 3 a.m. and there's been no letup!"" Political operative Clif White, running the office, was amazed by the speed and intensity of the popular response to Reagan's speech.

Some politicians didn't watch it. George Romney was on a speaking tour in Michigan. Robert F. Kennedy, running for the Senate as a New Yorker and busy campaigning on Long Island, was conversing with President Johnson. Former vice president Richard Nixon, however, the losing 1960 presidential nominee, did tune in. Nixon was grateful to Reagan for campaigning on his behalf two years earlier, when Nixon ran for governor of California and lost.

Nixon had keen political insight and knew political talent when he saw it. He could spot a potential political competitor as well. Immediately after the speech, Nixon noted that the one Republican winner emerging from the Goldwater debacle was not even on the presidential ballot: Ronald Reagan. Nixon likely started to mull the ramifications of the speech. He may have begun to appreciate that Reagan's clear call for individual freedom, coupled with his emergence into the political limelight, could threaten, from the conservative right, Nixon's own ambitions: He was musing whether to seek the Republican nomination for president once again.

And of course many other, ordinary citizens also listened to Reagan's speech and were deeply impressed. Like America as a whole and, for that matter, the world, the lives of those touched that evening by Reagan's speech would never be the same. A few of these men and women would would become political operatives at the heart of Ronald Reagan's first campaign for the presidency in 1968. Each of them had been transformed by the inspiring words they heard that October evening from Ronald Reagan four years earlier.

Across the nation, especially in the three major primary states where most of the 1968 action would be, these and many other hardworking grassroots Reagan activists laid the groundwork for what was to come later. They came close, ever so close, to seeing Ronald Reagan chosen as the Republican presidential nominee in 1968.

One other person, too, watched the speech. Former president Dwight D. Eisenhower carefully studied Reagan and ""The Speech."" Only two years earlier, Eisenhower and Reagan jointly cut a Republican publicity sound recording, not mentioned in any Reagan or Eisenhower biography known to me, entitled ""Mr. Lincoln's Party Today."" There, Reagan used some of the same phrases, about individual liberty, that he later used in ""A Time for Choosing.""

The general, as he preferred to be called after he left the White House in 1961, watched and heard Reagan praising the courage of American soldiers during World War II and challenging the free world not to leave Eastern Europe to suffer perpetual occupation by the Soviet Union. Just before Reagan spoke the immortal words ""rendezvous with destiny,"" he quoted another World War II hero, Winston Churchill. Eisenhower, the Supreme Allied Commander and D-Day leader, was an astute judge of character, politics, and nations. Looking and listening to Reagan, a new Republican star in the making, he liked what he saw and heard.

Eisenhower picked up the phone and called his former attorney general to say, enthusiastically, what a fine speech Reagan had just delivered. And the general was not done. After further reflection, he phoned his former special assistant to praise the speech to him. Eisenhower was no fan of the Goldwater candidacy. As he followed the race closely, the former president began to plan how to rebuild the Republican party after Goldwater's huge loss, which appeared likely. Eisenhower long had felt that his party had failed to market and communicate its ideals effectively.

Right in front of him, Eisenhower was seeing a remarkably eloquent Republican, clearly a great communicator. Eisenhower knew that in 1962 Reagan became a Republican and campaigned for Nixon in California's gubernatorial race and that",0.4979711457856488,0.7979711457856489,-0.30000000000000004,0.0

(Miss your favorite? Let us know what, why and where in comments!)

Dead of Night

A rules light and fun horror movie genre emulation RPG. Easy to get started, the prep is just a couple of minutes and then you are up and running. Publisher says: Dead of Night is the roleplaying game of campfire tales, slasher movies and b-movie horror. It is a game of screaming victims, unstoppable killers and slavering monsters, where the horror movie clichés flow thicker than blood and the only victory is survival.

Okult When the characters return to Hometown they realize that they have repressed the memories of something. And that something has again cast its dark shadow over the town. Publisher says: Okult is a rules light GM-less horror storygame, best suited for three to four players. The players take the roles of people who are a little bit like themselves, returning to a town a little like the place where they themselves grew up.

Ten Candles

Publisher says: A storytelling game of tragic horror designed for one-shot sessions. It is played by the light of ten tea light candles which provide atmosphere, act as a countdown timer for the game, and allow you to literally burn your character sheet away as you play. Ten Candles is described as a «tragic horror» game rather than survival horror for one main reason: in Ten Candles there are no survivors.

Cthulhu Dark

Highly narrative, simple rules, elegant execution. Allows you to tell stories where your descending sanity is the focus. You always succeed, but there are degrees of success. Simple combat system: If you fight something, you die. Publisher says: Cthulhu Dark is a rules-light system for Lovecraft roleplaying. The rules are fun and incredibly minimal: they fit on one sheet of paper. You don't need a character sheet to play, so you can start playing after two minutes of prep.

Fright Night

Publisher says: Fright Night is a lightweight, easy to learn and quick to play tabletop role-playing game intended to evoke the feel of b-movies, slasher flicks, horror films, and even dark comedies. The players take on the role of typical, everyday people that somehow cross paths with a variety of malevolent entities that they must either defeat, escape from, or contain.


Or, die trying.

Train, Hell, M1944

Publisher says: This is a macabre scenario. It deals with themes of powerlessness, abuse and body horror. There is nothing fantastic in it. Its content is not pleasant and the outcome will, most likely, be unpleasant as well. Either that is your thing or it really isn't. WAR IS OVER The men who fought and nearly died for their country in what's come to be known as the Second World War are bound for William C. Borden General Hospital in Chickasha, Oklahoma, a grim warehouse for soldiers who don't fit the heroic narrative. (Log in to download)

Dread

Dread is an excellent system for horror oneshots. Conflict resolution is handled by pulling bricks from a Jenga tower, making every skill check hair-raising. Publisher says: Dread is a game of horror and hope. Those who play will participate in a mutual telling of an original macabre tale. The goal of Dread is to sustain the delicate atmosphere that invokes the hand quivering emotion that lends its name to the game. The thrill of a Dread game lies within the tension between desire and loss. You will take on the role of someone trapped in a story that is only as compelling as it is hostile—someone who will find themselves making decisions we hope never to face in real life.


ViewScream

Publisher says: ViewScream is a live-action game designed for play with video-chat software like Skype or Google Hangouts. Three to five players assume the roles of desperate people trapped in a world of high-tech horror. (…) . The characters are separated (…) — and they need to work as a team in order to survive. Players never refer to their characters in the third person; they remain in character the whole time. A typical game session lasts 60-90 minutes.

The Black Pram

Freeform, free download. Publisher says: Lars and Helene are fighting for their baby's life. Every night a dark figure with a black pram waits outside their house. It waits for them to finally come out and give him what he wants. It waits for them to give up. If you like movies such as Pan's Labyrinth and Sixth Sense, this is the game for you.

258759,True,281,"As political theater, the threat last week from the Trump administration that it would pull the United States out of the North American Free Trade Agreement effectively enhanced the White House story line. From the campaign through his first 100 days in office, President Trump adroitly exploited the most conspicuous downsides of trade in portraying himself as a hero to those who go to work in coveralls.

But as economic policy, the feisty words — quickly downgraded to a pledge to ""renegotiate"" terms of trade with Mexico and Canada — potentially imperil significant swaths of the American economy.

A rupture to trade with those two countries would disrupt the global supply chain, jeopardizing factories in the United States that depend on imported components in making their wares. It could raise the costs of shoes, clothing and other consumer goods, while discouraging investment amid the uncertainty. It would threaten reprisals from trading partners, risking barriers to American exports.

It could cost jobs in the name of saving them.

257818,False,1024,"Last year Ducati raised eyebrows by testing front winglets on their MotoGP bikes, and this week at the Qatar test, Honda, Yamaha, and Ducati continued this trend. Riders said the winglets have some effect, and Marc Marquez said this needs to be ""studied well.""

Usually, my interest in such things is purely technological, and I'll get to that. But there is potentially something here more important than technology. Formula One cars are overtly high-tech, covered with aero devices that fascinate the onlooker. They look fantastic.

Grand Prix motorcycles look like every other sportbike in the world. Were it not for their splashy graphics, MotoGP grids would look just like rows of production R1s with their lighting removed.

That could all change if the FIM and DORNA could find ways to legalize safe aerodynamic devices. MotoGP bikes with wings and strakes could add visual drama to the sport and send strong waves into the aftermarket.

Wings on racing cars have the primary purpose of pressing the car more forcefully down against the track, thereby increasing tire grip and corner speeds. A secondary purpose is to prevent four-wheeled aviation of the kind that has on occasion sent racing cars flipping through the air. The claim, heard for many years, is that F1 downforce is so effective that the cars could race upside-down on a ceiling.

Long ago, back in the days when every F1 car was growing wing arrays, Colin Lyster, ever the trend-seeker, showed a race bike with a strut-mounted wing. It was clear that for every pound of downforce that wing generated when the bike was upright, it would generate at least half a pound of sideforce tending to push the bike off the track on fast turns.

If this is what wings-on-bikes do, what are Ducati and the others trying to accomplish?

The bike winglets of today are mounted up front, rather like ""moustaches"" on the front of the fairing. Their clear purpose is to provide a force that opposes front wheel lift and the loss of control it causes. Remember that in 2004, Valentino Rossi said, ""The wheelie is the enemy."" As riders accelerate with the machine upright, engine power can lift the front wheel up at well over 100 mph. To keep the front wheel from continuing to lift and the bikes blowing over backward, the rider must use less than full throttle up to this speed. What a waste! Watching the bikes accelerate away from Indianapolis's Turn 1-2 complex, it was possible to see the anti-wheelie systems of the major teams at work–and they all work by limiting throttle to keep the front tire just hovering near the pavement, never threatening to lift up and flip.

This is one job for front downforce–to keep the front tire from lifting and destroying control. This compels either the rider or the anti-wheelie system to cut power.

Now consider corner exit. The rider throttles up as much as rear grip and front lift allow. And what if rear grip allows the front to lift? The front tire stops steering the bike, which runs wide. Riders pull themselves forward on the bike to prevent this, but it's not enough. Even a modest downforce in this situation could usefully increase the amount of throttle the rider can use.

Naturally, Race Direction, DORNA, the FIM, and the riders never want to see the headline, ""Killer winglet gores rider."" Such devices must be safely designed.

Note, two paragraphs above, the words ""a modest downforce."" Look at the devices currently being tested; Yamaha and Ducati have shown stubby ""moustache"" winglets, located in the accelerated airflow moving around the fairing nose, and Honda's look like the turned-up points of an Edwardian gentleman's wing collar. All we have seen so far would be strong enough even if molded of rubber.

How much force? Aircraft wing loadings give a clue, being in the range of 25 to 70 pounds per square foot in a range of 140 to 200 mph, and lift varies as the square of speed. Efficient wings are shaped like a foot ruler, with a lot of length in relation to the inefficient tips. At the wingtip, air from the high pressure side can flow around to the low-pressure side, negating some lift. Some of the winglets we've seen have tip fences to limit this spillage, but even so, let's estimate the force-generating potential of these winglets as 25 pounds per square foot at 120 mph. Honda's two ""wing collar"" winglets perhaps total 10 square inches, or about .07 square foot. That suggests maybe two pounds of downforce. If Ducati's have seven times that area, we could estimate 14 pounds of downforce at 120 mph, 3 to 4 pounds at 60 mph",0.5260514640352792,0.7260514640352792,-0.1,-0.1
256620,False,1024,"Full disclosure: my wife works at CMS (and this post is entirely my views, not hers), I worked on the president's re-election campaign, and politically, I wish to see the PPACA law in general and the new marketplaces specifically succeed.

This has been an important week in the history of health care in the United States and for technology professionals working in government and on related services. Here are some thoughts on healthcare.gov and the state-based marketplace websites from my perspective as someone who was been developing and deploying web-based software applications for many years and who has experience with large systems and high-traffic sites.

As I write this there is a weird mixture of angst, elation, anticipation, control-freakery, sympathetic embarrassment, hope, and generalized anxiety about healthcare.gov and the state-based marketplace sites among supporters of Obamacare and also among left-leaning technologists. On the one hand, affordable health insurance is now available to any American; on the other, availability doesn't necessarily mean you can get it, due to errors during the sign-up process on healthcare.gov and the state-based marketplace sites which have been widely reported. There is a sense that, while this is primarily a technology problem to be fixed, the political problem is larger and may risk the implementation and success of the overall law–if enough people perceive the marketplace sites to be broken, support for the law–already tenuous according to some polls–will erode, and the law's opponents' argument that implementation needs to be delayed or even defunded will be persuasive.

It is natural for technologists to go into crisis mode and immediately start triaging problems and brainstorming solutions. They are smart and want to help and believe they can fix things. This is a totally appropriate attitude, and their nervous feelings are valid. The people implementing the marketplace sites have all the problems of developing large-scale, integrated, enterprise software, plus delivering a high-quality consumer experience. I think we should also have some perspective on what's happening, and I would caution against panic. There are a number of things to bear in mind:

Architecture. Caveat: I don't have direct experience with the marketplace sites, only second-hand knowledge about how they're implemented. That said, I know some details. The main thing to understand is there is no one, single Obamacare site–there is healthcare.gov, which is home to the federal marketplace and a portal to the state-based marketplaces, and there are the 20+ state-based sites. The federal marketplace is for all Americans for whom their states either chose not to implement their own marketplace or their site isn't ready yet.

The user interface, or frontend, of healthcare.gov is quite interesting. It's design has been compared favorably with top commercial sites. It was implemented using modern web development techniques, working well across browsers and on mobile devices. We used similar techniques on the president's campaign: generate static files from templates with Jekyll, serve them from behind a CDN (Akamai, in the case of healthcare.gov). This gives you a very fast, low-latency user experience that's very durable in the face of high-traffic loads. Dave Cole has written about the process by which the frontend was developed, it's fascinating to read if you have any experience with how government sites have typically been built. And you'll notice, no one has complained about being able to access the site itself. healthcare.gov itself has been up continuously since October 1st. It's submitting forms back to the server that's been the issue.

About the backend server: having a great frontend experience means little if you can't complete a transaction with the service. (Although, not nothing–many important informational consumer resources reside on the frontend and have been wholly unaffected by the reported outages.) People may not realize that a major part of Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act was the streamlining the rules surrounding Medicaid eligibility. healthcare.gov serves then as a portal, routing people to the appropriate resource they need to help them get covered. This means not only sending you to your state-based marketplace site if your state has one, but directing you to Medicaid instead of the marketplaces, if you are eligible, or determining that you meet requirements for a subsidy on the marketplace. In order to do these things, the system verifies your identity, income, and other personal data with new and existing government databases. In other words, so that it may route you to the correct entity that will be offering or providing you health insurance, healthcare.gov looks up your information online (i.e., during the course of a request-response cycle with the site). The architecture of healthcare.gov is an example of both the challenges of integration–different software services working together–and distributed systems–independent systems that may or may not be available or meeting certain service-level agreements or standards.

258645,True,616,"We can forget about fixing the planet's ecosystems and climate until we have fixed government systems, a panel of leading international environmental scientists declared in London on Friday. The solution, they said, may not lie with governments at all.

""We are disillusioned. The current political system is broken,"" said Bob Watson, the UK government's chief environmental science advisor, who chaired the meeting.

The panel, all winners of the prestigious Blue Planet prize, often seen as the Nobel prize for environmental science, were meeting to prepare a statement for the Earth Summit 2012, to be held in Rio de Janeiro in June – 20 years after the original Earth Summit in that city.

The world has wasted the intervening years, the group said. Ecosystems are disappearing ever faster, the world is still warming, and two 1992 treaties, on climate change and species loss, have failed to achieve their aims. Governments, the group said, were largely to blame.

""Last time in Rio we had an unreasonable faith in governments. Since then we've lost our innocence in believing government was wise and benevolent and far-sighted. That's been blown completely out of the water,"" said Camilla Toulmin, director of the International Institute for Environment and Development, a non-profit organisation based in London.

Not remotely sustainable

""Essentially nothing has changed in 20 years. We are not remotely on a course to be sustainable,"" Watson said.

""What's most discouraging is a loss of feeling that government would help us,"" said Harold Mooney, a veteran biologist from Stanford University.

No one held out much hope that the forthcoming summit would usher in a new era. Politicians do not seem interested. The 1992 summit lasted two weeks, attracted most of the world's leaders and garnered huge headlines. But this year's event will last just three days, and so far China's president Hu Jintao is the only head of state scheduled to attend.

""The UN text [for the summit declaration] is weak,"" said energy researcher José Goldemberg, who was Brazil's environment secretary at the time of the first summit.

Key priorities

The top priorities, according to Watson, are ending the fossil-fuel era to curb climate change, and investing in limiting population by making contraception available to all.

But neither were likely to happen because, said Syukuro Manabe, a climate modeller at the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, ""the political system is not motivated to worry about the future"".

The laureates said leadership was most likely to come from local government, NGOs and corporations, rather than national leaders or the UN. ""Decision-makers should learn from and scale up grass-roots action and knowledge in areas like energy, food, water and natural resources,"" the panel declared.

""We do believe that the political system can be reformed, and that there will be technical solutions. But time is not on our side,"" Watson said.",0.5727002067560398,0.7727002067560399,-0.2,0.0

He was a hit machine as a high schooler at Tokyo's Nichidai Daisan, for whom he homered and drove in five runs in the 2011 Summer Koshien final, and in college for Meiji University. There was, after all, a reason the Tigers were so pleased to have acquired him in the 2015 draft, and that Swallows manager Mitsuru Manaka was so outwardly excited when he thought Yakult had won Takayama's rights.

So, with that in mind, it's not too surprising to see Takayama have early success.

At the same time, while Takayama, 22, was expected to have some level of polish, certainly more than fellow 2015 first-rounder Louis Okoye, who was drafted out of high school by the Tohoku Rakuten Golden Eagles, he's still turned heads. The Tigers plugged the rookie into the leadoff role from Day 1, and his approach at the plate has been solid and produced good results.

""When I'm at the plate, I'm just trying to give it my all,"" Takayama told The Japan Times Thursday at Tokyo Dome.

The rookie has shown a mature approach at the plate and isn't overextending himself, instead approaching his at-bats focused on doing what's needed rather than going for the big splash each time. While he hasn't been perfect, and been prone to strike out, he's been very, very good.

""He's got a good idea at the plate,"" said Tom O'Malley, one of the Tigers' hitting coaches and a former Central League MVP and batting champion. ""He's got the natural ability. A lot of times with young hitters, you see them swinging at a lot of bad pitches, but he's got discipline, he makes things happen. He's not a type that walks, but he puts the ball in play and makes good contact.

""Especially with as young as he is, he's been awful impressive. I know what he did in college, but this is a little different level. But you can tell, he knows what he's doing at the plate. I think the more he learns the pitchers, the more he gets an idea of the patterns, he's going to be a tough out, I mean, he is now.""

Takayama had 53 plate appearances during the spring and hit .327 with a .744 on-base plus slugging percentage.

Since Opening Day, when the games, and the stats, began to count, he's hit .316, with three doubles, a triple and a home run in 12 contests (entering Friday). His OPS is .784 over that span.

""He's got some skills, that's for sure,"" O'Malley said. ""He's got good bat control, he's got a little pop in his bat. He's fun to watch. He's not your prototypical leadoff hitter, but he gets on base. He's been a big asset so far.""

Of course, ""so far"" hasn't been that long. Takayama is competing against professional players and coaching staffs now. Professionals make adjustments, and opposing teams will search for any weakness to be exploited.

The young star will have to make his own tweaks in order to remain far enough ahead of the curve to continue to be effective. That said, he already seems to have the necessary tools.

""I've seen him hit balls like Ichiro,"" O'Malley said. ""A couple of them have bounced, and he's put them in play. So obviously he's got great hand-eye coordination. I'm not trying to compare him to Ichiro, but I've seen some of his swings have been similar. He's got some pop in his bat too. He's got a lot of good attributes.""

Takayama is off to a good start, and with another solid-looking youngster, 20-year-old Shintaro Yokota, hitting second in the order, not to mention 21-year-old pitching ace Shintaro Fujinami, the Tigers' youth movement is giving fans something to be excited about.

Even if Takayama doesn't seem all that excited himself just yet.

""My goal this year is to just continue to become a better hitter and player,"" Takayama said.

It's that type of attitude, combined with the physical gifts, that has O'Malley seeing a bright future ahead for the rookie outfielder.

""He doesn't get too high or too low,"" O'Malley said. ""He's got a good temperament. You have to have",0.0,0.6702622115077015,-1.1,0.0
256155,True,464,"A ROMANTIC night inside a storm water drain under a freeway was interrupted when a police dog latched onto the unsuspecting Casanova's posterior.

But don't blame the dog - he was just doing his job.

The dog ""savaged"" the tunnel explorer's buttock after a chase for an alleged car thief led police into the drain in Sydney's north.

Officers swarmed a lake next to the Warringah Freeway, Artarmon when a driver fled an allegedly stolen Toyota Hi Lux overnight.

The offender jumped the road's guard rail and raced into bushes surrounding the lake.

A dog squad was called to follow his scent.

Officers followed the dog deep inside a storm water drain underneath the roadway where they stumbled upon a man, and his mattress.

Barks echoed up the chamber as the canine latched onto a person, presumed by police to be the offender.

But as a man was dragged from the drain by two officers he had a bright smile on his face, clean clothes and happily followed all instructions.

When police questioned the man about his activities in the pipe under the highway he said he was trying to sleep on a mattress he had secreted under the road.

His story was backed up by his girlfriend, who emerged soon afterwards.

Officers quickly realised this was not the driver of the Hi Lux, or two homeless people.

The Daily Telegraph believes the police had apprehended two members of the notorious ""Cave Clan"" while searching for the alleged car thief.

And the police dog had bitten him right on the bottom.

The couple asked not to be named but said their romantic night in the tunnel had been interrupted by the canine officer.

He said the police dog bit into his right buttock and ""savaged"" it during the confrontation.

The ""Cave Clan"" is a guerrilla type of organisation which leisurely explore storm water drains, abandoned bunkers and rail tunnels in urban areas.

Police continued to search for the Hilux driver by canvassing the area around the lake.

The offender was still on the loose when the tunnel explorers were released.

257872,False,1024,"The following column by Joel Sherman appeared in The Post on the morning of Sept. 22, 2001, one day after Mike Piazza's two-run homer in the eighth inning lifted the Mets to a 3-2 victory over the Braves at Shea Stadium in the first baseball game played in New York after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. This night, and that homer, have lived on as the seminal sports memories of that incredible time.

***

It was a night for symbolism beyond even the obvious such as Diana Ross's goosebump-raising rendition of ""God Bless America"" and the 35-foot- by-50-foot vinyl billboard of the stars and stripes that now dominates the right-field scoreboard.

Commercial planes soared over Shea in the pre-game and not only were they not the usual nuisance, but as Mets GM Steve Phillips said, ""I heard a couple and was glad we were getting back to normal.""

Met co-owners Fred Wilpon and Nelson Doubleday, who usually make sure never to be in the same place at the same time because of their mutual loathing, were on the field together, separated by no more than the red, white and blue ribbons painted near both dugouts.

Rudy Giuliani, the city's most overt Yankee fan and ordinarily persona non grata at Shea, received not one, but two rousing standing ovations replete with chants of ""Rudy, Rudy.""

The Mets and Braves, those best of enemies, followed stirring pre-game pageantry with a congratulatory line similar to those that punctuate a Stanley Cup playoff series and included a hug between Atlanta manager Bobby Cox and Bobby Valentine, a pair who actually make Wilpon and Doubleday seem like cast members of ""Friends.""

And then perhaps the most unlikely symbol of all took the field. For much of this season, the Mets were viewed as an underachieving, disappointing group. Now New York looks to them to be a Met-aphor of rising from rubble. Of not surrendering. Of performing a miracle, at least of the sports variety.

""Everyone is crossing their fingers and hoping for a miracle, but they are hoping that miracle occurs downtown,"" Phillips said. ""But if it is not going to happen there, it sure would be nice for everyone if it happened here.""

The feeling of the extraordinary encircled the Mets yet again last night. Mike Piazza, who cried during moving opening ceremonies, blew kisses to enthralled fans who saluted him in a Shea-shaking frenzy after he crushed a two-run homer onto the TV platform beyond the center-field fence with one out in the eighth. That blast rallied the surging Mets to a 3-2 victory that moved Mission Impossible even more into the Mission Improbable category.

On Aug. 17, they were 13 1/2 games out. Now they are just 4 1/2 out and still have five games against the first-place Braves, including two more this weekend. Do you believe in miracles?

""I was glad to come through and give these people something to cheer for at last,"" Piazza said. ""That's why they came out, to be diverted from the sorrow and the loss.""

The first baseball game in New York since the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks came with all the right flourishes. Both heroic rescue workers and the innocent dead were honored with a combination of rousing applause and respectful silence. Fans demonstrated patriotism with flag-waving, U-S-A-chanting fervor. And the mere presence of 41,235 showed a balance of defiance and community.

Met players again wore the hats of the NYPD and Fire Department, vowing to do so the rest of the year even if the Commissioner's Office does not give authorization. Stitched on their right sleeves was the date 9-11-01 with a flag. On Thursday, seven members of the team went to Ground Zero and Valentine said,

""We talked to about 1,000 people and 90 percent knew of the game (last night) or how many games out we were . . . I don't know win or lose if we are symbols, that is a heavy load to carry on the field. But I think we've been an inspiration.""

In spring, we had envisioned this late-season series against Atlanta would be filled with meaning, then for much of the summer we thought it would be trivial. But on the first night of autumn, a Brave-Met series was laced with the kind of significance none of us could have conceived, a significance so heavy that Todd Zeile said this game was more important than any of the five Subway Series games last October.

It was a game the Mets literally played for free, having donated their game salary to the families of those lost in the Twin Tower destruction.

Once the game began, the Shea fans booed Chipper Jones just like",0.43688011820497785,0.7368801182049779,-0.30000000000000004,0.0

Also, having fewer participants in a market because these participants are good enough to keep aspiring competitors at bay is not a bad thing. The problem arises when barriers of entry are artificial (legal, bureaucratic etc), not when they're part of the business itself. Barriers of entry as part of the business means that the current market's participants are so advanced that everybody else wanting to enter will have to get at least as good as the current participants for a start.

1.2 megabytes a second is only ~10 megabits per second - pretty sure my parents house has more bandwidth than that. Google is wiring Kansas City with gigabit fibre right now, and we're not running it as a charity. So network capacity doesn't worry me a whole lot. There's plenty of places in the world that can keep up with a poxy 10 megabits.


3T per month of transfer is again, not a big deal. For a whopping $75 per month bitvps.com will rent you a machine that has 5TB of bandwidth quota per month and 100mbit connectivity.


Lots of people can afford this. But by the time Bitcoin gets to that level of traffic, if it ever does, it might cost more like $75 a year.

Ultimately it's the UTXO set that is the hard limit on the storage requirements for full validating nodes. Even at just 1% volume growth, you're looking at 3GiB/month growth in your requirement for fast-random-access memory.


How did you arrive at 3GB/month? The entire UTXO set currently fits in a few hundred megs of RAM.

In the presence of a spin-phonon interaction, we obtain a nonzero angular momentum of phonons, which is an odd function of magnetization. At zero temperature, a phonon has a zero-point angular momentum in addition to a zero-point energy. With increasing temperature, the total phonon angular momentum diminishes and approaches zero in the classical limit. The nonzero phonon angular momentum can have a significant impact on the Einstein–de Haas effect. To obtain the change of angular momentum of electrons, the change of the phonon angular momentum needs to be subtracted from the opposite change of the lattice angular momentum. Furthermore, the finding of the phonon angular momentum gives a potential method to study the spin-phonon interaction. Possible experiments on phonon angular momentum are also discussed.

259661,True,556,"This year's edition of the E3 gaming trade show ended with a very short video teaser showing something really exciting, an upcoming handheld Steam Machine.

Did you ever want to play Amnesia or Mortal Kombat on the train? Well, the SteamBoy Machine Team is looking to make your dreams come true, then.

""Announced earlier this year, Steam Machines are new entertainment systems targeted for play Steam games in the living room. SteamBoy takes a step forward, carrying the fun everywhere,"" the team explained.

""I think people will get shocked by SteamBoy potential and possibilities. SteamBoy is the first device that allows to play Steam games on the go, you will keep playing your favourite games at the bus, the office, the school or the doctor's waiting room,"" SteamBoy Machine Team said.

The video offers a brief look at the SteamBoy concept design, featuring the signature round track-pads of the Steam Controller, and the ABXY buttons of the Xbox, with the device's screen positioned right between them.

The project is not affiliated in any way with Valve, and it will be released in a market that's already struggling, as the handheld gaming devices are facing stiff competition from smartphones and tablets.

The SteamBoy, however, will have a distinct advantage over the Nintendo 3DS and Sony PlayStation Vita devices, coming with a wide array of available games right off the bat, the devs saying that the console will allow gamers to play nearly all the games that are currently available on Steam.

The hardware details of the device are not yet final, and it is not yet entirely clear whether the device will be able to play the games on its own or by using Steam's in-home streaming feature, but its prospective hardware specs indicate that it will be able to run quite a few games on its lonesome.

The developers have that they were looking to fit the SteamBoy with a quad-core CPU, 4GB of RAM, and a 32GB built-in memory card, as well as a 5-inch 16:9 touchscreen.

The SteamBoy will be able to connect to the Internet via both WiFi and 3G, which means that it will most likely also support Valve's game streaming service.

During CES 2014, Valve announced that it had partnered with 12 hardware manufacturers in order to create several different models of Steam machines, specifically designed to play or stream Steam games using SteamOS. The first of the devices are expected to become commercially available in 2015.

SteamBoy Machine Team did not reveal any prospective release date apart from sometime during 2015, or any details regarding the handheld console's pricing, but we'll keep you posted on any further developments.",0.6431483721135378,0.7431483721135378,-0.1,0.0
257295,False,1024,"At its annual fan convention, CCP showed off two things from Valkyrie: a playable multiplayer demo, and a gameplay trailer from a dynamic, truly gorgeous single-player training mission. If you haven't seen that video yet, you should watch it right now:

Leaving the single-player mission to one side -- CCP isn't letting anyone play it, unfortunately -- the multiplayer demo showcases the core of Valkyrie: dogfighting. Gameplay, at its simplest, involves flying around and shooting any ship that's flagged as hostile. Of course, there are variables and additional layers like turrets and drones that will aid you in battle, but the objective is almost always to destroy enemy spaceships. It's definitely not the type of game I'd usually be drawn to, but playing a few rounds of Valkyrie with a VR headset was enough to win me over.

OMG I'm in a spaceship

Valkyrie's strength is in its presentation. There's no real standard for what VR games should look or feel like, and CCP has put a lot of work into getting things right. You're given a first-person view, looking out through the cockpit of a spaceship. There are no overlaid maps or radar readouts crammed into the corners of your display. Instead, the interface is the spaceship. Shield levels and ship health are displayed through bars of light projected onto your ship's front window. Details on your chosen target can be found on a dedicated screen above the (virtual) flight controls. Readouts on additional, less crucial equipment sit elsewhere in the cockpit, at the periphery of your vision. It's a system that wouldn't make sense if this game wasn't played on a VR headset, but because it is, it works really well.

This is what you see looking straight out of the cockpit.

The carefully considered UI had me fully immersed before I'd even launched into outer space. Every battle starts with a countdown to launch inside a larger ship. If you want to, you can look all around your ship in relative safety, including what's directly behind you. There are some neat little details there, like a little ""clean me"" message etched into the dirt of one of the side windows.

Playing on a PC with the Oculus Rift and a wired Xbox controller, piloting the ship is dead simple. If you're even a casual gamer, you'll be flying around with ease in no time at all. Actually shooting and targeting ships takes a little longer to get used to. In the ship class I chose (Wraith, the standard fighter) I had two options for destroying my foes, both based on line of sight. The standard weapon is a machine gun, and because your crosshairs are centered, you need to move your head around while steering the ship in order to effectively target enemies. The secondary weapon is harder to use, as you have to keep the enemy firmly in your crosshairs for a few seconds in order for your systems to lock on and fire away high-damage missiles.

Here, the player is aiming at an enemy to the left of center, which puts half of the UI out of view.

Once I grasped this line-of-sight offensive gameplay, the interface turned from beautiful into genius. I was either aiming at a fighter or checking if my defensive turret was ready to shoot down an incoming missile. I was barrel rolling away, looking helplessly for an aggressive enemy I couldn't see, or keeping tabs on my rapidly depleting shield levels. Just like in real life, you can't focus on multiple things at once. It's captivating.

CCP wants to build the world's first AAA-quality game for VR.

Granted, I've only experienced a single game mode, and a single map, but for what's described as a ""pre-alpha build,"" Valkyrie is ludicrously polished already. CCP is aiming to make the world's first AAA game for VR, perhaps not in budget, but certainly in terms of quality. Now that the core mechanics are in place, the task is to add all the progression and game modes needed for long-term success, and it's reaching out to eSports professionals to build in the addictive hooks and balanced gameplay necessary for competitive multiplayer games to thrive.

From demo to game

On its own, the demo is impressive. It's definitely the best VR experience I've had in the three years since I put on the first Oculus Rift prototype. But it still felt like just that: an experience, a fragment of a potential game (albeit a very good one) to add to a long list of cool stuff that VR can do. It wasn't until I saw the single-player footage, and talked to the team behind the demo, that I truly understood the potential for Valkyrie, and what CCP wants to achieve with this game.

The footage from the gameplay trailer is from the first single-player level that introduces the world and its characters. It's one of a number of training missions that are",0.264724448717062,0.764724448717062,-0.4,-0.1
258369,True,711,"We're pleased to announce that the Tesla Model S has received a maximum-possible 5-star safety rating from the European New Car Assessment Programme (Euro NCAP).

Model S is one of just a few cars to have ever achieved a 5-star safety rating from both Euro NCAP and the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA). Additionally, Model S is the only car this year to have achieved both a 5-star Euro NCAP rating and 5 stars in every NHTSA subcategory, including frontal impact, side impact, and rollover. Only two other cars have earned the same recognition since 2011 (when NHTSA introduced its latest rating scheme).

The reason so few models achieve 5-star ratings in both Europe and the U.S. is that each program places emphasis on different safety aspects in the assessment process. NHTSA emphasizes structural and restraint safety, with a deep focus on how well the vehicle can withstand and absorb the energy of an impact while protecting its occupants. It is also primarily concerned with adult occupants. On the other hand, Euro NCAP assesses a wider range of scenarios, including tests for child and pedestrian safety. Unlike for NHTSA, active safety is also an important part of Euro NCAP's 5-star requirement. Every year, the European organization raises the standard for a 5-star rating to account for technological advances in the industry.

The dual 5-star ratings for Model S validate our holistic approach to safety. We have been engineering passive and active safety systems in parallel, so the car is structurally sound and is also designed to intelligently anticipate and react to potentially dangerous situations.

Structurally, Model S has advantages not seen in conventional cars. It has a low center of gravity because its battery pack, the largest mass in the car, is positioned underneath the passenger compartment, making rollover extremely unlikely. It also has a large front crumple zone because of the lack of an engine, meaning it can absorb more energy from a frontal impact, the most common type of crash resulting in fatalities. Its body is reinforced with aluminum extrusions at strategic locations around the car, and the roof can withstand at least 4 g's. It was for these reasons that Model S achieved 5 stars in every subcategory when tested by NHTSA in 2013.

This quarter, we started implementing the Model S active safety system in conjunction with the introduction of new Autopilot hardware, consisting of 12 ultrasonic sensors that sense up to 16 feet around the car, a forward-looking camera, a forward radar, and a digitally controlled, high-precision electric brake boost. We specifically selected this hardware to accommodate the progressive introduction of new safety features via software updates over the course of the next several months.

While the features already pushed to the Model S fleet – Lane Departure Warning and Speed Limit Warning – have proven sufficient to merit a 5-star NCAP rating, we will go much further with active safety systems. Features coming soon include Forward and Side Collision Warning and Avoidance, Blind Spot Warning, and Automatic Emergency Braking.

Safety has always been Tesla's top priority, and we remain committed to continuously improving Model S to ensure that adults, children, and pedestrians alike receive the best possible protection from the car and its technology.

Besides using a single 1959 Nancy strip to demonstrate all of the formal properties of the medium in an unprecedented fashion, Paul Karasik and Mark Newgarden manage to take that same comic and map a huge artistic / professional /industrial/ historical story about comics. This story includes: How a gag might have a history unto itself; how a teenage apprentice could become a giant of the medium; how the damn comics were actually printed; how arbitrarily they could be published; and casual-seeming dives into cartoonists-gone-Hollywood, particular studio building, and even a now-obscure New York paper. I don't think there's another book that covers all of those facets, all of which are integral to the comics of the 20th century and few of which have been told. And Karasik and Newgarden do it with concision and, of course, wit. It's truly inspired. On a personal note, Paul Karasik was the first cartoonist I interviewed for publication (Ganzfeld 1) and Mark Newgarden maybe the first cartoonist I visited in New York. I interviewed them by email, and they answered in a single voice. Please visit the book's website for more info and a list of upcoming events.

You guys are nuts!

Yes.

You both have spent decades worshipping this strip. Are you done with Nancy now? Have you exhausted it for yourselves?

Well, we honestly thought our little side project would take a year or two to dispatch. We thought we knew the August 8, 1959 episode pretty well. Our original 1988 essay, which appeared in Brian Walker's The Best of Ernie Bushmiller's Nancy, contained eight levels of deconstruction and after teaching it all these years we figured there might be a handful more we could squeeze out. Ten years later How to Read Nancy has just landed —with a grand total of forty-three discrete aspects of this damned that strip we have isolated and analyzed (plus a comprehensive biography, seventeen appendices, dozens of meticulously restored line art strips –but wait! There's more!). Yet, despite the myriad grueling efforts it has taken to produce this book (Dun't Esk!), we continue to be mesmerized by Nancy.

We still see fresh Bushmiller strips that we have never seen before and still find them amusing, impressive, occasionally jaw-dropping… and, yes, fresh.

We still use Nancy in the classroom (as we hope many comics curriculum instructors will do once they get a hold of the book) and find that our students, as often as not, become equally enchanted.

So, while we can barely stand to look too closely at the finished book yet (still afraid the new baby has an extra thumb) we will always adore Nancy.

You mention a few times that Nancy has not received the historical attention (or affection) it deserves. I wonder if that's because is so prosaic on the surface. What is it about the way comic-strip history has been written that you think kept out Nancy? Is part of your contention that the almighty gag is equal to, say, the emotional heft of Krazy Kat or Peanuts, or the grandeur of Little Nemo? I think the answer is yes, and I agree, but perhaps you can explain a bit.

Krazy Kat and Little Nemo resemble ""Art."" Peanuts resembles ""Philosophy."" Nancy resembles nothing more and nothing less than a comic strip (and a gag-driven, self-proclaimed ""dumb"" one at that), hence: easily dismissed from the canon.

The public's affection has always been there. Savvy critics such as Manny Farber certainly ""got"" Nancy at the time of its initial popularity, but the next wave (1960s–1990s) of ""serious"" comics historians tended to revile the strip, for a variety of reasons that reveal more about their agenda (and their generational bias), than the merits of the work. Nancy was simply a hard sell for anybody trying to get the middlebrow public to take comics ""seriously"" when, for whatever reason, that was the name of the game. This includes the heroic Bill Blackbeard who single-handedly archived complete runs of nearly every 20th century American comic strip of consequence except Nancy, so deep was his ambivalence. (Due to this sin of omission, as far as we know, there is no complete hardcopy run of this once–ubiquitous comic strip left on planet earth.)

Our choice of the late, great Jerry Lewis for a foreword was highly intentional, yet despite some obvious parallels, Ernie Bushmiller never had the contemporary equivalent of the French New Wave publicly championing his work. Lewis gave us a great compliment in saying that ours is ""a book that was written with an infinite care rarely seen in today's world.""

When a sketch of her was published in local newspapers, several Huntington Beach residents said they had spoken with her. Her first name may have been Andrea and she may have been from the East Coast. She had no permanent home in Orange County.

She told another person she was from New York. She claimed that she was 25 or 26. But she appeared to be as young as 16. Her parents, she claimed, were pretty well-known, but she didn't divulge who they were. She had been adopted at a very young age. She didn't have any type of identification. ""Andrea"" also spent a night at the home of a mobile-home salesman who took pity on the homeless woman who had little clothing and no money. The family fed her, let her use the back bedroom and gave her some money. ""Andrea"" apparently took the money and bought clothes at a Goodwill store, including a pair of shoes for $19.95. She was wearing the pink shoes with the price tags still on when she was struck on the highway. The salesman said the morning ""Andrea"" left his house, she cut off some of her hair and put it on her finger. UPDATE: On May 4, 2017, she was positively identified as 26-year-old Andrea Kuiper of Fairfax, Virginia. She had traveled to California to find her biological family.

Disordered eating refers to a wide range of abnormal eating behaviours, many of which are shared with diagnosed eating disorders. The main thing differentiating disordered eating from an eating disorder is the level of severity and frequency of behaviours.

Read more: Warning Signs and Symptoms of Eating Disorders

Disordered eating can have a negative impact on a person's emotional, social and physical wellbeing. It may lead to fatigue, malnutrition or poor concentration. It can affect someone's social life (when socialising is restricted due to anxiety around food/eating), and can lead to anxiety and depression.

Disordered eating behaviours and attitudes include:

Binge eating

Dieting

Skipping meals regularly

Self-induced vomiting

Obsessive calorie counting

Self-worth based on body shape and weight

Misusing laxatives or diurectics

Fasting or chronic restrained eating (read more on fasting for cultural or religious reasons)


What is considered ""normal"" in terms of quantities and types of food consumed varies considerably from person to person. ""Normal eating"" refers to the attitude a person holds in their relationship with food, rather than the type or amount of food they eat.

It is normal to:

Eat more on some days, less on others

Eat some foods just because they taste good

Have a positive attitude towards food

Not label foods with judgement words such as ""good"", ""bad"", ""clean""

Over-eat occasionally

Under-eat occasionally

Crave certain foods at times

Treat food and eating as one small part of a balanced life

Mindful eating

Mindful eating is a simple-to-learn life skill which can lead people to enjoy a satisfying, healthy and enjoyable relationship with food. It is a skill that can help people break free from 'food rules' and begin to enjoy healthy, flexible and relaxed eating practices. Mindful eating is not a diet.

257856,False,1024,"Telecom analyst Eimon Hoey has a rather pessimistic view on the prospects of new competitors entering an already crowded and competitive telecommunications market, dominated by three incumbents.

""Do these guys have a chance? The entrants? The answer is no,"" Hoey told CBC News. ""Unless the [industry] minister is willing to change 30 to 40 years of bad policy.""

Despite government efforts to create a more competitive playing field, the top three — Bell, Rogers and Telus — still control about 90 per cent of Canadian cellphones while the three more recent market entrants — Mobilicity, Public Mobile and Wind Mobile — are all up for sale.

Telus has already made a $380-million bid to take over Mobilicity and the deal passed numerous regulatory hurdles, including approval by Mobilicity's bondholders. But on Tuesday the federal government announced that it won't allow Mobilicity to transfer its wireless spectrum to larger rival Telus, which means the companies' $380-million takeover is nixed as currently constructed.

""Our government has been clear that spectrum set aside for new entrants was not intended to be transferred to incumbents,"" Industry Minister Christian Paradis said Tuesday at a news conference in Ottawa.

It's unclear whether Telus will still be interested in buying Mobilicity for its brand and customer base.

Meanwhile, Rogers and Quebec-based Videotron announced a network sharing agreement last week that would include the option of allowing Rogers to acquire Videotron's Toronto spectrum licence.

And, with Calgary-based Shaw Communications Inc. saying earlier this year it had abandoned its cellular network plans and worked out a deal for Rogers to purchase its unused network spectrum, observers question whether it's at all possible for a new national competitor to go head-to-head against the incumbent carriers and carve out their own slice of the Canadian telecom pie.

'Writing on the wall'

""I think the writing is on the wall, the prospects are clearly dim,"" said telecom analyst Carmi Levy. ""Almost without exception, all the newcomers are struggling to boost their subscriber numbers.

""As a result, we can expect other dominoes to fall before this is all done,"" he said.

Many analysts commend the government for its attempts to open up the market. Back in 2007, Ottawa announced that it would auction off a portion of the wireless spectrum specifically to new wireless company entrants in a bid to foster more competition in the industry.

But, as Levy says, the government did not do enough to ensure those new players would survive long term.

""They simply opened up this spectrum and assumed the free market would be enough to sustain them. But clearly in a market as heavily regulated as this, free market economics aren't enough,"" he said.

Although spectrum was reserved for new companies, the cost of the wireless highways are enormous, saddling new investors with huge capital costs.

""Before you've even signed up your first customer, you're already on the hook for billions of dollars worth of spectrum,"" Levy said. ""Therefore you have to bring in deep-pocket investors who are willing to survive the long haul until their customer base grows to the point that they can survive.""

Market saturated

The auction also came at a time when the market was already quite saturated, said analyst Troy Crandall of MacDougall, MacDougall & MacTier.

""The problem is that these new entrants were so late to the game that the penetration rate was so high in Canada and they were entering a mature market already,"" Crandall said, adding that the Canadian market may only have room for one additional competitor.

""For a competitor to come in now, I'd probably say yes, it would be extremely difficult unless they were able to come in with some niche-like product that the market doesn't currently have,"" he said.

But Levy said consumers must also bear some responsibility for the dearth of cellular choice.

""Canadian consumers, for all their complaining about lack of choice in wireless and telecommunication services, when push comes to shove, they tend to stick with what they know and, as as result, they have clearly, over the last three years, been relatively hesitant to try anything new,"" he said.

Yet the problems go deeper than that and can be traced back decades, Hoey said. Back in the mid-1980s, the government failed to project the growth in telecom subscribers, and handed out free spectrum to the incumbents and their predecessors, Hoey said, allowing them to avoid huge startup costs.

""From the policy perspective, it's a mess. It's a mess because Industry Canada awarded itself the obligation to create winners and losers,"" he said.

This initial allocation of spectrum, along with foreign investment rules, tied up potential capital, and has discouraged more players in the market, Hoey said.

TRIESTE, Italy, Dec. 15 (UPI) -- In a recent survey of mini-spiral galaxies, astronomers found a unexpected relationship between dark and light matter. The relationship is easy to measure yet impossible to explain using the Standard Model of physics.

Researchers from Italy's International School for Advanced Studies conducted a statistical analysis of three dozen mini-spiral galaxies. Their work revealed a strong correlation between the organization of dark and regular matter in each galaxy.

If, for example, ordinary matter was condensed at the center of a mini-spiral galaxy, so too was dark matter. If the bulk of regular matter was scattered across the outskirts of the galaxy, so too was dark matter.

""We studied 36 galaxies, which was a sufficient number for statistical study,"" Paolo Salucci, an astrophysicist at SISSA, said in a news release. ""By doing this, we found a link between the structure of ordinary, or luminous matter like stars, dust and gas, with dark matter.""

RELATED Hubble captures confused identity of Virgo galaxy

The Standard Model assumes most dark matter consists of non-baryonic or weakly interacting massive particles.

""It would not interact with ordinary matter except through gravitational force,"" explained Ekaterina Karukes, who recently earned her PhD at SISSA. ""Our observations, however, disagree with this notion.""

The strong correlation between the organization of dark and regular matter in mini-spiral galaxies undermines the assumptions of the Standard Model. The discovery demands a new model of physics.

""This can be a starting point for exploring this new kind of physics,"" said Salucci. ""These 36 items are the tip of the iceberg of a phenomenon that we will probably find everywhere and that will help us discover what we cannot yet see. ""

258230,True,696,"Ever since Microsoft announced their Bridge technologies at Build 2015 questions about how they work (and how well) have been asked. The tools let developers port over Android apps (Project Astoria), iOS apps (Project Islandwood), web apps (Project Westminster) and classic Win32 apps (Project Centennial) to Windows 10 including phone. This morning, the actual tools for Project Astoria have leaked onto the web and users can freely (and illegally) download Android APKs and sideload them to their Windows Phone running Windows 10 Mobile. This follows yesterday's leak of the documentation for the project. As it turns out, the tools are very powerful with the only limitation being the inability to run Google Play apps, which is in many ways trivial (this also means Snapchat will not work). Indeed, Windows Central has learned these tools are far from final and that the upcoming TH2 release has many more improvements, promising a much better user experience. Microsoft going all out courting iOS and Android developers for Windows 10 Windows Central is not linking to the file nor providing instructions on how to sideload. Simply put, the software is not finished, and the ability to steal Android apps is not something we would like to promote. We also don't need the traffic. Obviously, this situation is unique and Windows Central is caught between reporting on this and aiding and abetting it.

Developer Concerns The idea that developers can simply and directly convert an Android APK to a Windows 10 APPX is both fascinating and a bit disturbing for developers. Here is why: Android developers – Their apps can now ""easily"" be downloaded and installed on Windows Phone, often without paying or abiding by the software's EULA. Of course, this not new, as this situation has always existed for Android developers. Windows Phone developers – This situation, however, is unique. Windows Central has already spoken to a few developers who are distraught about how easy it is to port. Indeed, a few of them feel burned and are ready to give up on native Windows Phone app development because why bother? Certainly Project Astoria is controversial. On the one hand, why should developers now make Windows Phone apps when they can just do Android and port it over? The alternative argument, of course, is that developers want to write a native Windows 10 app so that it can run on the phone, PC and other Microsoft technologies. These are places where Android apps cannot go even as a port. Once again, this is a chicken and egg situation for Microsoft. If developers port over their Android apps to Windows Phone, Windows 10 Mobile's market share can grow. If it grows, developers can re-write their apps for all of Windows 10 to target an even larger market. Then again, developers may port Android apps (or not) and Windows Phone native app development languishes and goes nowhere.

For Windows Phone users Putting aside the developer situation, which at best is now very unstable, what about consumers? Assuming developers bother to port their apps – something that remains to be seen – certainly those using a Windows Phone could see a big boost in available apps and games from these Bridge tools. Boosting apps and games in the Store, after all, is the point of the projects. The Android apps are not just run in-situ but can plug into various components of Windows 10 including notifications and Live Tiles.

Thanks to improved cooperation and communication between a number of organizations — police, government transport officials and air navigation staff — responding to incidents has become the near equivalent of most other crimes.

""It's now like responding to a bank robbery, a break and enter in progress or a similar call for assistance,"" said Sgt. Cam Kowalski of the Richmond RCMP which handles an average of 35 calls a year where aircraft coming into YVR have been hit by the intense light from a laser.

And that's no mean feat considering some of the lasers being used have a range of 100 miles or more — a capability that gives culprits the ability to set up and pin point aircraft from just about anywhere along the flightpath in the Lower Mainland.

""We're responding to calls from places like Garry Point here in Richmond, out to Burnaby and Port Coquitlam,"" said Kowalski who specializes in the field of visual interference with aircraft which is becoming more common as prices for powerful lasers make them more accessible.

""In the last 10 to 12 years there's been a dramatic increase in laser strikes globally, which includes YVR,"" Kowalski said. ""What we've done is create a response protocol for laser strikes.""

It's one now being used nationally with local law enforcement agencies racking up the best rate for arrest and conviction — four in the past six to eight months, Kowalski said.

""We've been able to close the (communication) loop between the actual aircraft on descent, to NAV Canada, E-Comm and the police in the jurisdiction affected,"" Kowalski said.

""So, everybody is aware and responds accordingly when a call comes in, giving it the seriousness it deserves.""

Once police have been notified in the suspected community where the laser strike originated, the decision is made to employ a K-9 unit, or even task one of the RCMP's two helicopters to try and locate the suspect(s).

As to why someone would target an aircraft with a laser, Kowalski said some may see it as a form of entertainment, while if an intent to harm is present, that vaults the offence into more serious territory.

Those found guilty are subject to federal and provincial penalties under the criminal code, aeronautics act and Canadian aviation regulations, Kowalski said, adding the penalties can include a $1,000 fine and forfeiture of the laser.

256081,True,547,"It's no secret that Katy Perry and Taylor Swift aren't part of each other's squad. The two used to be close friends (even after that time they both dated John Mayer), but after that 2013 Rolling Stone article seen around the world, things went south. Here's a quick refresher from the article:

""For years, I was never sure if we were friends or not,"" she says. ""She would come up to me at awards shows and say something and walk away, and I would think, 'Are we friends, or did she just give me the harshest insult of my life?'"" Then last year, the other star crossed a line. ""She did something so horrible,"" Swift says. ""I was like, 'Oh, we're just straight-up enemies.' And it wasn't even about a guy! It had to do with business. She basically tried to sabotage an entire arena tour. She tried to hire a bunch of people out from under me. And I'm surprisingly non-confrontational – you would not believe how much I hate conflict. So now I have to avoid her. It's awkward, and I don't like it.""

Yikes. Well, if the Bad Blood music video means anything, it's that the feud is far from over, and Perry is making it known in a salty video she took while at a Kanye West concert. While spending the morning of her birthday placing her vote for Hillary Clinton, Perry had more big plans at night — to dance her ass of at the Kanye West concert in Los Angeles.

But it was during West's controversial song ""Famous"" that Perry made her feelings for Swift known. During everyone's favorite line — ""I made that b*tch famous"" — Perry added the below video to her Instagram story:

258585,True,702,"World Wrestling Entertainment Inc. said Thursday that it will slash 7% of its workforce after costs of ramping up its online-subscription service WWE Network helped put it into the red in the second quarter.

WWE reported a net loss of $14.5 million, compared with a net profit of $5.2 million a year earlier. The staff cuts, and other cost-cutting moves, would help boost operating income before depreciation and amortization by $30 million in 2015, WWE said. A company spokesman said the cuts, which will total around 50 to 60 people, will affect all business units.

WWE's launch of WWE Network in February made it one of the few entertainment companies with a presence in cable television to also sell a stand-alone online offering. WWE still has shows on television, such as ""Raw"" and ""Smackdown"" on channels owned by Comcast Corp.'s NBCUniversal, although in May WWE failed in a bid to win a big increase in the TV fees it receives from NBCU.

On Thursday WWE reported net additions of 33,000 subscribers for WWE Network since April, lifting total subscribers to 700,000. WWE has previously set a year-end target of one million subscribers and has noted that 1.3 million to 1.4 million subscribers would put it past a break-even point offsetting difficulties in pay-per-view.

WWE Network gives fans willing to pay $9.99 a month access to various programming, including from WWE's library, as well as the monthly specials previously available on pay-per-view on television.

WWE initially asked subscribers for a six-month commitment. With the six months coming to an end in August, Benchmark Company analyst Mike Hickey said there were concerns that WWE would see a ""roll off"" of subscribers from late August through October.

To perhaps stave off those who may not renew the subscription through the summer and early fall, the company will add additional methods of payment, including a commitment-free $19.99 monthly plan. On a call with analysts, WWE executives said they expected to see 4%-8% of subscribers churn off every month.

""For us the payment options are one way to continue learning, to see how people approach it,"" said George Barrios, chief strategy and financial officer. ""The fact that we've gone from 0 to 700,000 paying subscribers, I feel really proud.""

WWE shares spiked after the earnings report Thursday morning before leveling off, trading 3% up at $12.54 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange.

An upcoming episode of National Geographic's Taboo series features Japan's newest body modification trend: bagel heads.

Recipients create a bagel-shaped knot on their foreheads by injecting saline solution into the skin, causing it to swell. After reaching its maximum puffiness, the injector uses his thumb to create an indention in the head — kind of like a thumb-print cookie.

The modification lasts 18-24 hours. Nat Geo shows how the process is done, but the video does leave a lot of questions unanswered. For example, does the forehead become saggy after repeated use? Did we learn this from the aliens? And what do they think about all of this anyways?

257360,True,1016,"Free Bet Profit Explained

In 'Step 4 - Profiting From Free Bets' we said that you will make between £9 to £15 from a £20 free bet, depending on the odds you choose. Here is a table from the Coral offer showing this.

£20 Free Bet

Back Odds Betfair

Liability Your Profit

(% conversion) 2.0 £11 £9 (45%) 3.0 £30 £12 (60%) 4.0 £50 £13 (65%) 5.0 £65 £14 (70%) 6.0 £90 £15 (75%)

As you can see from the above table, if we choose odds of 2.0, our £20 free bet converts to £9 cash, which is 45% conversion from free bet to cash. Whereas if we choose odds of 6.0, our £20 free bet converts to £15 cash, which is a 75% conversion from free bet to cash.

In this optional article, we explain the why higher odds means higher profit and run through an example.

Why Higher Odds = Higher Profit?

If our £20 free bet wins, we do not receive the £20 stake back as part of our winnings.

Therefore, by betting on a dead cert, we are limiting our winnings to a small amount given our £20 stake is not returned.

Whereas if we bet on team with high odds that could make us £100+, we can make a big profit as our £20 stake is quite small in comparison to our winnings. The only consideration with high odds, is it requires a higher liability in Betfair Exchange.

Gimme an example with low odds!

Sure, let's say we use our Coral £20 free bet on England to beat Russia. The odds are 1.95:

Our winnings if England win are:

£20 x 1.95 = £39

minus our £20 free bet stake = £19

To guarantee a profit, we use matched betting by placing a lay bet on Betfair Exchange. With lay odds of 1.99:

We can enter these 3 numbers (£20, 1.28, 1.35) into the Calculator, remembering to use 'Free Bet SNR' in the dropdown:

This shows us by using odds of 1.95 our guarantee profit is £9.30 from our £20 free bet.

On the plus side we only need £9.69 in our Betfair account, being the liability.

Great that I make £9.30, but where actually is my profit?

It simply depends on whether your bookmaker or exchange bet win:

As you can see from the above table:

If England win, we win our Coral free bet for £19 winnings, but lose our Betfair £9.69 liability. This give us a net profit of £9.31.

If England do not win (draw or Russia win), we lose our Coral free bet (costs us nothing), but win our Betfair £9.79 lay bet. Deducting the 5% commission, this gives us a net profit of £9.30.

Gimme an example with high odds!

No problem, let's say we use our Coral £20 free bet on Ukraine to beat Germany. The odds are 6.0:

Our winnings if Ukraine win are:

£20 x 6 = £120

less our £20 free bet stake = £100

To guarantee a profit, we use matched betting by placing a lay bet on Betfair Exchange. With lay odds of 6.4:

We can enter these 3 numbers (£20, 6, 6.4) into the Calculator, remembering to use 'Free Bet SNR' in the dropdown.

This shows us by using odds of 6.0 our guarantee profit is now £14.95 from our £20 free bet.

Just be wary that we need £85.05 in our Betfair account, being the liability.

Even better that I make £14.95, but where actually is my profit?

Exactly the same as the previous example, it simply depends on whether your bookmaker or exchange bet win:

As you can see from the above table:

If Ukraine win, we win our Coral free bet for £100 winnings, but lose our Betfair £85.05 liability. This give us a net profit of £14.95.

If Ukraine do not win (draw or Germany win), we lose our Coral free bet (costs us nothing), but win our Betfair £15.75 lay bet. Deducting the 5% commission, this gives us net profit of £14.96.",0.0,0.6127626068477009,-7.1000000000000005,-0.1

In a statement Estonia claimed the Russian Antonov An-72 transport aircraft flew close to the northern island of Vaindloo in the Baltic Sea for around 90 seconds at 18.23 local time on Monday evening (5 September). The statement said the Russian pilot ignored Estonia's air traffic control despite its responders being switched on.

There have been regular squabbles between the Nato alliance and Russia in the Baltic region, which is close to the Russian border. Both sides accuse the other of ignoring transponders, though according to Postimees newspaper most Russian planes are fitted with Soviet-era transponders which render Western civilian radar ""blind"" to them.

This transponder issue could result in a civilian airliner accidentally colliding with a Russian jet, said Postimees. The newspaper quotes an anonymous Russian officer who admitted most Russian jets don't even possess transponders.

Russia's Ministry of Defence spokesman Igor Konashenkov told state news agency Itar-Tass that no Russian planes were in the area at the time of the alleged incident. ""Aircraft from Russia's air force regularly carry out flights over the Baltic Sea, however their routes fall strictly within international rules and regulations on using airspace and neutral waters,"" said Konashenkov, according to Newsweek.

Bulgaria, also a Nato member, says Russia violated its airspace on 10 occasions in July 2016 alone, four of which were by military aircraft. Turkey also accused Russia of violating its airspace on several occasions before shooting down a Russian jet in December 2015.

255662,False,1024,"Why your marriage sucks Passion has died, argues author Cristina Nehring, taking domestic bliss with it. But is romance really in crisis?

Why would anyone submit to the doomed delusion that is marriage? The unmarried among us have surely begun to ask this question. (No doubt the married have, too, though in the past tense.) For several years now, disdain for heterosexual unions has been on the rise -- or at least the disdainful have been more vocal -- and it's become increasingly difficult to believe that a lasting marriage is possible. If it is possible, the ""hard work"" it requires will wring the partnership of all passion and wonderment and joy. From the narratives of wifely grievance routinely published in women's magazines to the spectacular public bust-ups of numerous celebrity marriages in which we have placed our bruised faith, it's easy to glean that we currently inhabit a vast and bleak landscape of marital discontent.

There are numbers to corroborate this: In a much-discussed recent survey of 35,000 American women, published in the July issue of Woman's Day, 72 percent of married women said they had considered leaving their husbands. Seventy-nine percent said they'd like sex more often, and 52 percent said they have no sex life to speak of. Contemporary marriage, all signs would indicate, is a long, tedious slog toward sex-starved paunchiness via an endless, embittering negotiation of banalities: who will shuttle the kids, walk the dog, prepare the meals, wash the laundry.

Last week, as though timed to the release of the survey findings, two female writers offered their respective takes on the subject. In a heavily parsed essay in the July/August issue of the Atlantic Monthly titled ""Let's Call the Whole Thing Off,"" writer Sandra Tsing Loh explores the dissolution of her 20-year marriage, pinpointing as the superficial cause her extramarital affair and subsequent inability ""to take on yet another home- and self-improvement project, that of rekindling [her] romance."" From her personal predicament she diagnoses a broader epidemic of dissatisfaction -- emotional, social, familial and, most of all, sexual -- among women. ""To work, to parent, to housekeep, to be the ones who schedule 'date night' ... and then, in the bedroom, to be ignored -- it's a bum deal,"" she writes. Literary critic and essayist Cristina Nehring, who also happens to write for the Atlantic, takes a more impersonal approach in her contrarian polemic, ""A Vindication of Love""; she writes of the bankrupt state of romantic love in our society: ""We inhabit a world in which every aspect of romance from meeting to mating has been streamlined, safety-checked and emptied of spiritual consequence … Romance in our day is a poor and shrunken thing.""

Do our problems with marriage arise from our impoverished ideas about romance? Though Loh cites lack of love, a fairly standard excuse, as a reason for her divorce -- ""I did not have the strength to 'work on' falling in love again in our marriage,"" she says, in the therapeutic parlance of our day -- Nehring is convinced that love as we currently define it, or at least as we practice it, is too safe, too sterile, acculturated and tamed. We are apparently unwilling to acknowledge love in all its unresolved messiness, unable to recognize that transgression, obsession, power inequities and strife might enflame our passions rather than diminish them, saving us from blandness and boredom. ""It is the trivialization of love that is the tragedy of our time,"" Nehring writes, with signature melodrama. ""It is the methodical demystification, recreationalization, automatization, commercialization, medicalization, and domestication of Eros that is making today's world a much flatter place."" Her solution is a kind of perceptual readjustment. ""Romantic love needs to be reinvented for our time. For those of us as bored by the cult of safe love as we are by the man-hating clichés of old-style feminism, it needs to be formulated afresh."" A change in ideology, perhaps, will bring about a change in attitude.

But I don't believe that our notions of romantic love are at fault, nor are they all that different from the ideal Nehring propounds. For many of us, our models of deep romantic feeling have been formed through books and films and television. Romance novels comprise 32 percent of adult mass-market paperback sales; Harlequin, the predominant publisher of bodice-ripping tales, sold 130 million books in 2007, notes a recent article on the genre. These portraits rarely involve what Loh calls ""companionate marriage,"" with partners divvying up the childcare and chores. Fictional love tends to be obsessive, transgressive, regressive, operatic, unequal, full of conflict or a disaster of the grandest",0.6682432470835405,0.7682432470835405,-0.1,0.0

255582,True,480,"Gun Control Fails to Save Teacher From Being Murdered by Bigger and Stronger Attacker

How was Danvers High math teacher Colleen Ritzer killed? With a box cutter by someone who was bigger and stronger than she was.

After school, the accused murderer, Philip Chism, followed her into the girls bathroom. The ""whys"" of what happened are still being investigated, whether this was a rage killing or attempted rape has not yet been discovered but one thing was for certain, Ms. Ritzer was beaten and stabbed and never left that bathroom alive.

Video from the school showed Chism rolling a recycling bin through the school and it was found near where he dumped her body.

My question to the school and to the state of Massachusetts was, ""how exactly was Ms. Ritzer supposed to survive?""

She was in a confined space, cornered with no place to escape, where an armed attacker who was bigger and stronger than she was began to beat her before pulling out a box cutter (which are against the rules to have in school) and ended her life.

If she was allowed to exercise her 2nd Amendment rights, if she was armed with a small handgun the size of her palm

could she have fought back and lived? Yes…she could have. Though nothing is certain she definitely wouldn't be any worse off than she is now.

Unfortunately, Ms. Ritzer didn't have that choice. In Massachusetts, like schools in most states, she is denied her right to choose and as such the war on women that gun controllers wage continues. Wherever women are disarmed they will be targets and victims to those who are bigger and stronger.

Gun Rights at its core is about equality. Gun Control on the other hand, fosters a world where someone big and strong can murder with a box cutter, or a hammer, or a screwdriver anyone who is smaller and weaker than they are. Even David was given a sling to shoot Goliath…lest that story have a very different ending.

While gun controllers would prefer to live in a world without guns, where rapists and murderers can do as they please to the smaller and weaker without fear of being stopped, I prefer to live in a world with more dead rapists shot by their would-be victims.

259746,False,1024,"After President Bill Clinton signed welfare reform legislation in 1996 ""ending welfare as we know it,"" many highlighted this ""common sense"" solution and criticized progressives for opposing the bill. Soon after passage, politicians and the media said it had not caused the downsides that activists had predicted, ignoring that the law had not been fully implemented. But troubling reports soon emerged.

Jason DeParle wrote a number of pieces in the New York Times about rising homelessness among Milwaukee families denied welfare under the new law. Welfare rolls were down, but the nation had unusually low unemployment, and many leaving the rolls had become homeless. Now, a new report shows that the Clinton welfare law is performing exactly as opponents feared, as the nation's deep recession allows states to force families off aid and into destitution. It is an American tragedy, largely ignored because the victims are primarily low-income women and their children.

After reading Robert Pear's April 11 story on how welfare reform is playing out in blue-state Rhode Island, I wondered whether it would echo through the rest of the media. After all, the media had given extraordinarily positive coverage of the ""success"" of the 1996 law eliminating the federal welfare entitlement, and recall many reporters in the late 1990's who expressed surprise when I told them I thought the bill would cause great harm to families.

Today, a decade after implementation, the Clinton-Republican ""bipartisan"" welfare law is a failure. As unemployment has doubled since 2007 and the number of people receiving food stamps has skyrocketed by 40%, the welfare caseload has risen only 10% — a clear indication that the nation's poorest families are not receiving welfare grants due to the restrictive time limits imposed by the 1996 law.

Ask yourself: if the federal government allowed states to put time limits on food stamps, would those numbers have gone up 40%? Or would we have even more kids on the streets begging for alms?

Politics over Policy

Families are suffering unnecessarily today because Bill Clinton branded himself a ""New Democrat,"" vowed to ""end welfare as we know it"" as part of his 1992 campaign, and then found himself at the start of his 1996 re-election year with not having passed welfare reform.

In the paranoid world of presidential politics, Clinton's people actually believed that Republican Bob Dole could defeat him that November unless welfare reform was passed. So Clinton, along with every Democratic Senator up for election that year except the late Paul Wellstone, joined with Republicans in enacting a welfare bill that omitted many of the essential safeguards that progressives had insisted be part of any deal.

Safeguards like avoiding lifetime time limits, which were completely unrealistic in light of the nation's boom and bust economy. Or allowing states to cut or even eliminate benefits as sanctions against families allegedly missing work requirements, regardless of surrounding circumstances.

Liberal supporters pointed to the increased funding for job training, and argued that this was worth the trade-off. Others pointed to the current system not giving recipients sufficient incentive to work (as if the meager grants available prior to 1996 would lead many people to prefer welfare to employment).

Few with experience working with low-income families felt the time limits were anything but a strategy for states to reduce their rolls. And that is precisely what happened.

Progressives Proven Correct

Welfare reform was said to be a tremendous success in the years following passage, because the economy had jobs for welfare recipients and the lifetime time limits had not kicked in. And thousands of articles and columns written about welfare reform succeeded and why its progressive critics were wrong.

And progressives were not simply criticized for backing the wrong policy. Instead, opponents were identified McGovernite, ""big government knows best,"" pie-in-the-sky 1960's throwbacks whose views had brought the Democratic Party nothing but failure in national elections.

But as progressives warned back in 1996, welfare reform could not be measured only by the first few years, or only during economic good times.

As family homeless shelters are overfilled in city after city, as mothers are forced to return to abusive husbands to get money for their kids, and as child poverty has greatly increased since 1996, the law's failure is clear.

A 35-year Head Start worker in Woonsocket, Rhode Island told Pear, ""For the first time, we are seeing significant numbers of families who report no income whatsoever, zero, because they have reached the time limit on cash assistance or have been sanctioned for not meeting work requirements.""

Since 1996, the proportion of children receiving welfare has declined by 50%, while fewer than half of economically eligible families participate in the program.

As progressives predicted, the primary impact of the welfare law has been to deny cash assistance to the nation's poorest families. This escalation of poverty among the nation's families is a key part of Bill Clinton's legacy, ignored as he troops through the third world on missions to help the downtrodden.

Anaxagoras of Clazomenae (a major Greek city of Ionian Asia Minor), a Greek philosopher of the 5 th century B.C.E. (born ca. 500–480), was the first of the Presocratic philosophers to live in Athens. He propounded a physical theory of ""everything-in-everything,"" and claimed that nous (intellect or mind) was the motive cause of the cosmos. He was the first to give a correct explanation of eclipses, and was both famous and notorious for his scientific theories, including the claims that the sun is a mass of red-hot metal, that the moon is earthy, and that the stars are fiery stones. Anaxagoras maintained that the original state of the cosmos was a mixture of all its ingredients (the basic realities of his system). The ingredients are thoroughly mixed, so that no individual ingredient as such is evident, but the mixture is not entirely uniform or homogeneous. Although every ingredient is ubiquitous, some ingredients are present in higher concentrations than others, and these proportions may also vary from place to place (even if they do not do so in the original state of the cosmos). The mixture is unlimited in extent, and at some point in time it is set into motion by the action of nous (intellect). The mixture begins to rotate around some small point within it, and as the whirling motion proceeds and expands through the mass, the ingredients in the mixture are shifted and separated out (in terms of relative density) and remixed with each other, ultimately producing the cosmos of apparently separate material masses and material objects, with differential properties, that we perceive.

Anaxagoras, son of Hegesibulus (or Eubulus), was a native of Clazomenae, on the west coast of what is now Turkey. According to Diogenes Laertius (see the article on Doxography of Ancient Philosophy) (Diels-Kranz [DK] 59 A1), Anaxagoras came from an aristocratic and landed family, but abandoned his inheritance to study philosophy. (We do not know how he acquired his philosophical learning). He came to Athens (perhaps about the middle of the 5th century, perhaps earlier), and was a friend and protégé of Pericles, the Athenian general and political leader. There is controversy about his time in Athens; Diogenes Laertius says that he came to Athens to study philosophy as a young man. Some scholars claim that his arrival was as early as the Persian invasion of 480 (O'Brien 1968, Woodbury 1981, Graham 2006), others argue for a later date of about 456 (Mansfeld 1979, see also Mansfeld 2011 on Aristotle's evidence; there is a good discussion of the problems about dating Anaxagoras' life in Sider 2005). It is clear from their dramas that his work was known to Sophocles, Euripides, and perhaps Aeschylus (Seneca suggests in his Natural Questions 4a.2.17 that they shared Anaxagoras' view about the source of the Nile); it was certainly familiar to the comic playwright Aristophanes (Curd 2007, Sider 2005; see Mansfeld 1979). He was a resident in the city for at least twenty years; he was said to have been charged with impiety (and perhaps with Medism, political sympathy with the Persians), and banished from the city (437/6?). The charges against Anaxagoras may have been as much political as religious, because of his close association with Pericles. He retreated to Lampsacus (in the eastern Hellespont) where he died; ancient reports say that he was much honored there before and after his death. Democritus, a younger contemporary, dated his own life in relation to Anaxagoras', saying that he was young in the old age of Anaxagoras (DK59A5); he reportedly accused Anaxagoras of plagiarism. Although Anaxagoras lived in Athens when Socrates was a youth and young adult, there are no reports that Anaxagoras and Socrates ever met. In Plato's Phaedo, Socrates says that he heard someone reading from Anaxagoras' book (probably Archelaus, who was, according to Diogenes Laertius, pupil of Anaxagoras and teacher of Socrates). Anaxagoras is included in the ancient lists of those who wrote only one book: in the Apology, Socrates reports that it could be bought for a drachma.

As with all the Presocratics, Anaxagoras' work survives only in fragments quoted by later philosophers and commentators; we also have testimonia about his views in many ancient sources. The standard collection of Presocratic texts (both fragments and testimonia) is H. Diels and W. Kranz, Die",0.7505392922721024,0.7505392922721024,0.0,0.0

256217,True,992,"Music Theory: Keys, Scales and Triads

The table below summarises the basic ideas of music theory that relate to keys, key signatures, scales and triads. The key signature, major triad, minor triad and degrees of the scale are listed for all of the common major keys. Just find the key that you want to look up in the left hand column, then read across to find the triads, key signature etc.

Note that some degrees of the scale (e.g 2nd & 9th) correspond to the same note. The difference is that one (in this case, the 2nd) will be a note within the first octave of the scale, and the other (the 9th) will be in the second octave of the scale.

Thanks to Laramie Sasseville for getting me started with this reference table.

Minor keys

To find the notes of the scale for the minor key, look up the scale for the relative major key but start from the root of the minor scale (which will be the 6th of the major scale). In the above example, the scale of B minor is found by reading from the scale of the relative major (D major). Start on the 6th (B), then read across, looping back from the octave to the 2nd.. This gives us B C# D E F# G A as the B minor scale.

Enharmonic equivalents

Also, it might seem a little odd to come across notes such as Fb, for example in a Db minor triad. Although you might be tempted to substitute E instead of Fb, as they are enharmonic equivalents, it is wrong to write a Db minor triad as Db E Ab - you must write the triad as Db Fb Ab.

Other keys

The key signature of the ""unusual"" key will have seven more sharps or flats than the key with the same letter name. In our example, the key signature for G# major will have seven more sharps than G major. The table lists G major as having one sharp (F#) so G# major will have 8 sharps (F will be double sharp).

The idea of having double sharps or double flats is a little strange when you first come across it, but it's a well established idea in music theory and means you can use consistent rules for scales and keys.

The table below shows the relationships between the major and minor keys. To find the relative major or minor for another key just look up the corresponding entry in the table. For example, to find the relative minor of D major, find D in the major key column - this gives you B minor in minor key column so B minor is the relative minor of D major.

Tension was running high in the NXT Arena as the first Dusty Rhodes Tag Team Classic Semi-Final got going. The mega team of NXT Champion Finn Bálor & Samoa Joe was out to continue their tear through the tournament, while the roughneck duo of Scott Dawson & Dash Wilder were out to pull the biggest upset of the tournament.

TakeOver: Respect photos | Video highlights | Watch the show on WWE Network

Despite Dawson & Wilder's best efforts to control the pace of the bout, Bálor & Joe bulldozed them at the start. The NXT Champion nearly had the victory wrapped up in minutes, with Dawson in position for the Coup de Grace, but Wilder distracted Bálor, allowing his partner to take out the enigmatic champion's knee.

Dawson & Wilder trapped Bálor in their corner, relentlessly working over the NXT Champion's knee, as he screamed in agony. Things looked bleak for the mega team as Bálor struggled to stand up, let alone fight back to his corner. But somehow, the demonic champion slipped out of Wilder's grasp and tagged in the submission master. Joe went on a rampage, until Bálor demanded to tag back in. Joe relented, hitting Wilder with the Muscle Buster, while Bálor came crashing down with the Coup de Grace after to cement their place in the tournament final. However, that Coup de Grace appeared to do further damage to Bálor's left knee, leaving the NXT Universe to wonder if he would be able to compete in the Dusty Rhodes Tag Team Classic at all.

Baron Corbin & Rhyno def. Jason Jordan & Chad Gable (Dusty Rhodes Tag Team Classic Semi-Final)

The mat masters of Jason Jordan & Chad Gable looked to have the massive duo of Baron Corbin & Rhyno off their game, using their speed and pure wrestling ability to stay one step ahead of their monstrous foes. The Man Beast was baffled early as Jordan & Gable took him down to the canvas repeatedly.

After Gable trapped him in the ropes with an armbar, Rhyno finally had enough, sending Gable crashing to the floor with a big knee. The Lone Wolf smelled blood and pounced on Gable, hurling him into the LED boards on the ring apron. That gave the team of titans the opening they needed to take control of the match. Corbin & Rhyno worked over the former Olympian, with Gable trying to slip out of their clutches, only for a dirty trick to keep him away from Jordan.

But after Rhyno whiffed on a splash from the top rope, Gable finally reached his partner. Jordan came into the bout on fire, taking on The Man Beast and The Lone Wolf himself. The bout broke down into a brawl as all four men went at each other. Gable looked to have the victory in sight, after pulling off a stunning German suplex on the massive Corbin. However, Gable tried to spin around Corbin, only to meet the End of Days, as The Lone Wolf sent himself and Rhyno to the finals.

Asuka def. Dana Brooke

The debuting Asuka attempted to offer a show of sportsmanship at the start of the bout, offering to shake Brooke's hand, only for The Total Diva to slap it away. The NXT newcomer showed her experience, keeping a hammerlock on tight as Brooke rolled through on several occasions attempting to escape.

Brooke tried to get inside Asuka's head by slapping her across the face. That only incensed Asuka, who unleashed a flurry of devastating strikes on her rival. Unfortunately, Asuka also had to deal with Emma, who tried to interject herself into the bout at every opportunity. Brooke tried to take control of the bout, but ended up in an Asuka submission hold more often than not.

Asuka finally put a stop to Emma's interference with a hard spinning back fist, before trapping Brooke in the Asuka Lock to earn her first WWE victory! The newcomer didn't hesitate to get a measure of payback for Dana ruining her contract signing after the bell, flooring The Total Diva with one last devastating roundhouse kick.

EXCLUSIVE: Asuka checks up on Dana Brooke

Apollo Crews def. Tyler Breeze

Tyler Breeze's quest to regain respect in NXT continued at TakeOver, as he battled undefeated newcomer Apollo Crews. There was no slowing down the red-hot Crews, who clobbered Prince Pretty with a dropkick, then followed Breeze out to the floor to hit him with a big shoulder tackle.

In a meeting with European leaders in Brussels, Belgium, on Nov. 29, 2015, Davutoglu agreed to a deal in which the E.U. will provide Turkey with more than $3 billion in aid to stop Middle Eastern refugees from traveling to Europe. File photo by Maryam Rahmanian/ UPI | License Photo

BRUSSELS, Nov. 29 (UPI) -- The European Union on Sunday offered Turkey billions of dollars in aid as part of a deal to stanch the flow of migrants into Europe.

The E.U. will give the Ankara government $3.2 billion -- and will revive talks for Turkey to enter the union -- in exchange for it to keep Middle Eastern refugees inside Turkish borders.

The BBC quoted Turkish Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu, who stood in for President Recep Tayyip Erdogan at the meeting in Brussels, Belgium, as saying it was a ""historic day"" in relations between Turkey and the E.U.

Under the agreement, Turkish citizens may be allowed access to the E.U.'s 28 member states through the visa-free Schengen zone.

German Chancellor Angela Merkel said the most important part of the negotiations was to ""replace illegal migration with legal migration,"" and that while Turkey had so far sheltered more than 2 million Syrians, it ""had received little international support for that and therefore rightly expects that the European Union and the member states attempt to lighten Turkey's burden.""

The International Organization for Migration says 721,217 migrants arrived in Greece between Jan. 1 and Nov. 25, 2015, while 143,114 arrived in Italy over the same period. A vast majority came from war-torn countries such as Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan.

Some E.U. officials expressed concerns about civil rights violations by the Erdogan administration against critics, journalists and the Kurdish minority.

255749,True,488,"If rarity is a criterion of how valuable a mineral is, diamond is no match for fingerite. This combination of copper and vanadium figures in a list of 2,500 rarest of the rare minerals, which have, for the first time ever, been painstakingly categorized by researchers from the Carnegie Institution in Washington, D.C., and the Rockefeller University in New York.

""Fingerite is like a 'perfect storm of rarity,'"" Robert Hazen, who co-authored a paper, which is set to be published in the latest issue of the journal American Mineralogist, told the BBC. ""It occurs only on the flanks of the Izalco Volcano in El Salvador — an incredibly dangerous place with super-hot fumeroles. ... If you just change the ratio of copper to vanadium slightly, you get a different mineral. And every time it rains, fingerite washes away.""

And fingerite is not the only ephemeral mineral on the planet. Edoylerite, metasideronatrite, and sideronatrite, which also feature in the list of the 2,500 rarest minerals, decompose instantly when exposed to sunlight, while hatrurite — discovered in the Hatrurim Formation in Israel — only forms at a temperature of over 1,250 degrees Celsius (2,282 degrees Fahrenheit).

""Scientists have so far tracked down 5,000 mineral species and it turns out that fewer than a 100 constitute almost all of Earth's crust. The rest of them are rare, but the rarest of the rare — that's about 2,500 minerals — are only found at five places on Earth or fewer,"" Hazen said.

Contrast that to diamonds, which are found in at least 700 locations around the world.

Despite their rarity, or perhaps because of it, these minerals assume special importance for geologists and biologists seeking to understand the creation and evolution of Earth and of life. Scientists believe that many of these rare minerals are a product of biological processes, and could also provide a way to seek out the presence of life on other planets.

""It's the rare minerals that tell us so much about how Earth differs from the Moon, from Mars, from Mercury, where the same common minerals exist, but it's the rare minerals that make Earth special,"" Hazen told the BBC.",0.7727096284380752,0.7727096284380752,0.0,0.0

Run The Jewels Lyrics

(feat. Diane Coffee)

[Killer Mike:]

Down with the shame

Down with the shame

Used to walk traps in the rain with cocaine

Used to write raps in the traps as I sat in the rain and I prayed that God give me a lane

Give me a lane

Give me the fame

Give me the fame and I promise to change

Won't be the same

Won't be the same type of man that puts cocaine in this lady's hand

Heard she was pregnant, I'm guilty I reckon cause I hear that good shit can hurt baby's brain

Heard he was normal 'til three and then he stopped talkin'

Since then, ain't nothin been the same

Seen her some years later out in decatur told her that I'm sorry for causin' her pain

Causin' me pain?

Causin' me pain?

She asked again and she grabbed my right hand

Asked am I crazy, said look here, baby, I release you from all of your sins and your shame

Cause I've been redeemed

I found in Christ

Whatever it take I hope you find it, Mike

The look on her face shown that glory replaced all the shame and the hate and that she wears a crown

My late grandma Bettie had prayed with her heavy and told her to tell me lay my burdens down


[Hook:]

Can't pick up no crown, holding

What's holding you down

Can't pick up no crown, holding

What's holding you down

Can't pick up no crown, can't pick up no crown


[El-P:]

(Down with the shame

Down with the shame)

Carried the flag in some other men's name

Loaded my weapon and swore to them vengeance and stepped with aggression right into the fray

Into the haze

Into the murk

Told me to prove to them what I was worth

We'll teach you to move without mercy and give you the tools to go after the causers of hurt

You'll become death

You will take breath

This is for everything you've ever loved

Use all the pain that you've felt in your life as the currency go out and trade it for blood

You are not you

You are now us

We are the only ones that you can trust

You'll become fear

They'll become dust

Before this moment you didn't mean much

You are the smoldering vessel of punishment born to do nothing but justify us

Give us your empathy we'll give you lust

Let yourself go my son time to grow up

Give up your childish obsession with questioning

Anything we don't tell you is irrelevant

Everything you've ever been is replaced by the metal and fire of the weapon you clutch

257390,False,1024,"ENGLEWOOD, Colo. -- On his way through 15 NFL seasons that have included 12 Pro Bowl selections, Denver Broncos cornerback Champ Bailey has seen players come and seen players go.

He's seen good signings and some not so good, he's seen teams with guys all rowing in the same direction, and teams with guys who won't even put the oar in the water. And he's seen it takes just one bad veteran apple to push the whole tree down.

Or as Bailey put it: ""One thing you don't want to do is put a bad vet in your locker room.""

It comes to light as the Broncos, now 9-1, have had some veteran players do what they've been asked to do, whether it was what they expected or not, and not made waves. Players who have had bigger roles for the team or in other places, with different job descriptions now.

""The locker room, the team spirit, it's all connected in how you relate to each other,"" Broncos interim coach Jack Del Rio said. ""If you've got a guy who's sour, that's always complaining about something, his own situation, whatever it may be, it sucks the life out of the group.""

Broncos executive vice president of football operations John Elway has always said one of his first goals as the team's top football decision-maker was to ""get the locker room the way it needed to be,"" and the best way to do it is building a foundation of homegrown players by ""stacking those draft classes."" But Elway also wants free agency to be a tool to fill in around the edges, or in the case of signing quarterback Peyton Manning, as the ultimate dip into the annual veteran talent grab.

""But you always want to make sure, whether it's one-year deal or somebody like Peyton, that it's the right guy, that he's going to be what we want for the Denver Broncos,"" Elway said.

The Broncos signed Quentin Jammer, a 12-year veteran, on May 30 in hopes he could make a move to safety and be a physical player who could play in coverage deep down the middle of the field. But once he arrived and practiced with the team, Del Rio said the thought was Jammer simply played better at cornerback, but the Broncos also had some depth there.

As a result Jammer played just one snap in the first seven games of the season combined.

""But there aren't many guys like him,"" Broncos cornerback Dominique Rodgers-Cromartie said. ""He just gets to work, and when we needed him he was ready. Guys like that, who have done as much as he has, they make you go. We all can see how to go work from guys like him and Champ.""

With some injuries and Jammer's play through the week in practice, he has since played 19 snaps on defense against the Redskins, 33 against the Chargers, including two snaps to open the game when Rodgers-Cromartie told Jammer to take his spot to make the start against Jammer's former team. And Jammer had 20 plays on defense in Sunday night's win against the Chiefs.

""I think that's another great example of a guy, when you talk about a proud veteran that has played at a high level for a number of years in the league, and for him to remain a positive teammate -- I think that's why you saw that kind of tribute start that he got (against the Chargers), because the group recognizes this is a guy that has a lot of skins on the wall, and this guy has played a lot of good football,"" Del Rio said. "" ... For a guy -- a veteran guy with all his experience, all his accomplishments -- he's accepted his role and been a great teammate. It's such a positive thing to have for your football team.""

Tight end Jacob Tamme played 46 percent of the Broncos' snaps on offense in 2012 on the way to 52 receptions. This season, with Julius Thomas having been the primary receiver at the position (Thomas already has 10 touchdown catches this season), Tamme has played just 52 snaps on offense over the first 10 games, and has three catches.

But Tamme is the team leader in special teams tackles, has played on 63 percent of the plays on special teams, and came within an eyelash of blocking a punt against the Chiefs on Sunday.

Safety Mike Adams, a 10-year veteran, started 16 games last season, but lost his starting job in training camp to Duke Ihenacho. Adams has since played in some of the defense's specialty packages to go with one start this season when Ihenacho was injured. Adams will likely be looked to again with free safety Rahim Moore having had surgery on his lower right leg Monday morning.

""But a guy like Mike, he knows what he has to do and he's always ready,"" cornerback Chris Harris Jr.",0.2002260831474307,0.7002260831474307,-0.4,-0.1

256847,True,244,"Misinformation about politics may often seem silly — the immigration bill will give out free cars! — but the consequences of false beliefs in public health can be deadly.

In the developed world, myths about the risks of vaccines have enabled the resurgence of communicable diseases like measles and pertussis. And in developing countries, false beliefs have hindered efforts to fight H.I.V./AIDS and eradicate polio in countries like Nigeria and Pakistan.

The latest example of the dangers of health misinformation comes from Western Africa, where the response to an Ebola outbreak in four countries has been hampered by conspiracy theories about its causes and phony rumors about how to treat it. False beliefs may not be the biggest obstacle to containing the Ebola outbreak, but they make an awful situation worse.

People in the affected regions have become especially distrustful of doctors, with some suggesting the disease is a hoax. A resident of a heavily affected area in Liberia told The Wall Street Journal last week: ""I've never seen anybody die of Ebola. I've only heard of it. So it's a rumor."" These beliefs are often based on conspiracy theories that the disease was invented by national governments in search of international aid or political power.",0.8134708758926383,0.8134708758926383,0.0,0.0

The Diplomat. Madrid

Today is the 200th anniversary of the battle of Waterloo, which put an end to the French Revolution and to Napoleon Bonaparte's imperial dreams. The Spanish diplomatic and military history has forgotten about one of its heroes of the Peninsular War, who played a determinant role in that battle.

It is the General Miguel Ricardo de Álava (Vitoria, 1772–Barèges, France, 1843), who held, on several occasions, the position of Spanish Ambassador to England (twice), France (twice) and the Netherlands.

Álava has the honour of being the only Spanish officer to have participated in the battles of Trafalgar and Waterloo, the most important ones of his time. He fought the first one –and lost– against the English of Admiral Nelson. He fought the second one in Belgian land against the French and along his friend Sir Arthur Wellesley, the Duke of Wellington.

Álava was ambassador of Ferdinand VII to the Netherlands, with headquarters in Brussels, when Napoleon fled from the island of Elba and returned to the metropolis victorious. By order of the monarch, he integrated into the General Staff of Wellington in which, at the end of the day, would be the only Spanish contribution to the so-called Seventh Coalition created against the French Emperor.

There is a lot of documentation, most of it British, indicating Álava's presence with Wellington the night prior to the battle (from 17 to 18 June 1815), as well as during it and, when everything was over, having dinner on their own at the inn Jean de Nivelles of Waterloo, according to the book 'Álava en Waterloo' by Ildefonso Arenas.

General Álava was Spanish Ambassador to England, France and the Netherlands

Subsequently, this general was ambassador to France (1815 and 1835), deputy for Álava (1821), president of the Parliament (1822), ambassador to the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland (1834 and 1838), senator (1834 and 1836), minister of the Navy (1835) and president of the Cabinet for a few days (1835).

During the Maria Christina's regency, he was ambassador to London, where he tried to manage the intervention of the Quadruple Alliance firmly and with economic and military support during the Carlist Wars in favour of the Queen Isabella II. However, his determination did not bear fruit.

Finally, and not being very happy about it, he accepted to be ambassador to Paris, where he presented a plan for the Christian troops to cross to France in their fight against Carlism, to refuel in the neighbouring country and to stop the supplies getting to Carlists. In London's Embassy again, he returned to Spain, being already very sick, in June 1843 and died within a month on one of his trips to the south of France to take therapeutic baths.",0.40685862830621167,0.7068586283062117,-0.30000000000000004,0.0
259169,True,986,"Women underestimate their attractiveness whereas men are overly complacent about theirs. Why the difference? It is tempting to imagine that this is simply a reflection of continuing power imbalances favoring men. Yet, there is a simpler explanation. Women care more about their appearance because looks are more consequential for them.

It is important to establish that feminine worries about physical attractiveness are not due to a general lack of that social psychologists see as emblematic of low social status in a society. As David Brooks (1) writes:

For decades, surveys indicated men had higher than women. But there is some evidence that the gap has narrowed or vanished. A 2011 study from the University of Basel based on surveys of 7,100 young adults found that young women had as much self-esteem as young men.

Despite higher global self-esteem, women do not feel good about their appearance. This disconnect can be attributed, at least in part, to concerns about . According to Linda Jackson, ""Although females are more dissatisfied with almost all aspects of their bodies than are males, most of their dissatisfaction centers around weight issues, namely, around being too fat."" (2, p.186)

Concern about being overweight is unlikely to go away for two good reasons. The first is that overweight is becoming a bigger objective problem as time goes on. The second is that the slender standard gets more extreme as women make strides in careers and project an image of professional competence rather than stereotypical femininity(3)

Why women are more concerned about their appearance

In general, women are much more concerned about their appearance than men are. The key reason for this is that their appearance is central to how they are evaluated by others (2).

That phenomenon is often rejected as ""lookism"" but giving it an unpleasant name is not going to make it go away. We sometimes need to remind ourselves that we are an evolved species on this planet.

The evolutionary process of sexual selection changes us so as to attract mates. Men's facial hair makes them more sexually attractive to women, for instance. This is a sexual signal analogous to the brightly colored feathers of peacocks and other male birds. This phenomenon was revealed in experiments but most women seem unaware of it (3).

Humans are rather unusual in the sense that sexual selection affected both sexes but apparently did more work on females than on males. This is consistent with a variety of evidence that women's physical appearance is more important for their success than is true of men (2).

Sexual selection altered female facial proportions making them more stereotypically youthful. For that reason, highly attractive women such as movie stars seem much younger than their actual age.

The cosmetics industry also labors to remove signs of age-related damage to the skin. The relevant is that with women are less likely to conceive and have less of their reproductive lives ahead of them. Men who selected youthful-looking women as spouses would thus have sired more children.

The other key sexually-selected of women is their hour-glass shape that inspired painters over the ages. This stereotypically feminine shape is also exaggerated in highly attractive women such as movie stars and pageant winners (3). It is crafted by so that women are most curvaceous during the most fertile years of their lives.

The operation of sexual selection on women has numerous practical consequences. Women are perceived as more attractive than men. They are also perceived as sexier which is why attractive women are more prominently featured in advertisements on the premise that sex sells.

Women also spend huge amounts of money on clothes, cosmetics, and other products and services that enhance their physical appearance. One might argue that this is further evidence of insecurity about their appearance produced by the burden of being evaluated by men based on their appearance (lookism).

Yet, men often evince a frustrating obliviousness to the beauty endeavors of their sweethearts. I never heard a man saying he wished that his girlfriend would spend more time and money on her appearance.

The truth is that women's insecurity about their appearance is driven by with other women. We see this quite clearly in connection with the slender standard of attractiveness where women wish to be more slender than men find attractive (3). The reason, of course, is that they want to beat their competitors – other women.

CANBERRA, Australia - Australian lawmakers committed on Wednesday to legalize the growing of marijuana for medical use within a part of the world renowned for zero-tolerance and harsh penalties for illegal drugs.

The government introduced a bill to Parliament that would amend the Narcotics Drugs Act 1967 and create a licensing scheme for growing medicinal cannabis. Marijuana is currently illegal throughout Australia, but two states are considering making the drug available for therapeutic uses.

""This government understands that there are some Australians suffering from severe conditions for which cannabis may have applications and we want to enable access to the most effective medical treatments available,"" Health Minister Sussan Ley told Parliament.

The bill is guaranteed to become law, with the main opposition party immediately pledging support.

Southeast Asia has some of the world's toughest drug laws.

Indonesia, Australia's nearest neighbour after Papua New Guinea, created a diplomatic rift last year by rejecting Australian pleas to spare the lives of two Australian heroin traffickers. The Australians were among eight drug convicts executed by firing squad in April. Indonesia argued that the tough response was needed because narcotics abuse among Indonesians had reached a crisis level.

Edward Aspinall, an Australian National University expert on Indonesian politics, did not expect marijuana crops growing legally in Australia would damage relations with Indonesia.

""If it even rates notice among the Indonesian authorities or politicians, it will just be seen as an example of the inappropriately liberal and permissive nature of Western societies,"" Aspinall said.

The government said the proposed amendment would meet Australia's international obligations to ensure that production, manufacture and distribution of marijuana was for medical and scientific purposes only.

A government survey of 24,000 Australians nationwide found in 2013 that 69 per cent of respondents supported a change of law to permit cannabis use for medicinal purposes.",0.8498703069906338,0.8498703069906338,0.0,0.0

255407,True,455,"JERUSALEM — A famously child-friendly country with a federally subsidized universal health care system that offers free fertility treatments, Israel has made it easier for economically distressed women to obtain an abortion.

The 2014 ""health basket"" of medical services and medications approved by Israel's cabinet Sunday (Jan. 5) includes free abortions for Israeli women aged 20 to 33, regardless of the circumstances.

The $4.6 million earmarked by the Health Ministry committee will cover some 6,300 abortions for women who cannot afford the procedure.

In 2013, almost 20,000 women received permission to abort from hospital termination committees, according to Efrat, an organization that encourages women considering abortion to have their babies.

Until now, government-funded abortions have been reserved for women younger than 19 or older than 40, and in cases where the fetus has a severe defect, the mother's life is endangered, or the pregnancy is a result of sexual abuse. If a woman believed the pregnancy would cause her harm, physically or emotionally, she had had to pay for the procedure herself.

Ruth Tidhar, who heads Efrat's assistance department, said that in a country like Israel, where mothers receive paid maternity leave and preschool education is heavily subsidized, ""it gives a mixed message when contraceptives aren't funded by the government while abortions are.""

Judaism does not share the Roman Catholic belief that life begins at conception, but various Jewish streams have a range of opinions on the issue. The one thing most Jews agree on: That abortion is always permissible if the mother's life is in danger.

Rabbi David Stav, the head of Tzohar, a modern-Orthodox rabbinical organization, criticized the new abortion guidelines.

In a TV interview on Arutz Sheva, Stav said it is ""immoral"" for the state to fund abortions that result from a mother's ""personal decisions"" rather than serious medical problems.

""The state (will be) allocating resources for personal decisions,"" said Stav that are ""forbidden by Jewish law.""

is a demon that was being held captive underneath Joshua and Margaret's house . He was trapped in a forcefield in their house down a cellar and the forcefield was powered by a teddy bear with a tape player in its back. The forcefield would turn off if the tape player wasn't switched at a certain time of each day and Jermaine used a watch as an alarm to quickly slide down the cellar and flip the tape back.

In the end of the episode ""Jermaine,"" Bryce manages to escape the forcefield and rips the face of the teddy bear. He then walks away with Jermaine as they have a conversation indicating that they might be frenemies.

In ""Abstract,"" Jake discovers that Bryce is now Jermaine's art dealer. He accuses Bryce of using his demon ways to get Jermaine to turn his back on painting landscapes, but Jermaine reveals he just got tired of landscapes and wanted to paint abstracts instead.

Appearance

Bryce is a huge blue creature with narrow yellow eyes and a wide mouth. He walks on four legs and is in fact a demon as Jake said in ""Abstract.""

Personality

Bryce has a very wild personality and a hate towards Joshua for allegedly stealing his poster. At times, Bryce dislikes Jermaine as seen in the episode ""Jermaine,"" where Bryce told Jermaine that he would eat him if he escaped.

However, he was surprised when Jermaine told he'd have released him if he didn't threaten him. This caused him to offer to be friends if he let Bryce out of the forcefield though he was quick to go back to threatening after Jermaine refused.

He also has a very smug personality and always thinks that whatever he does is cool. He seems have negativity in him too if things don't go his way.",0.608828690301578,0.708828690301578,-0.1,0.0

259053,True,398,"The night before what would have been Tom Petty 's 67th birthday, a group of fans convened along the Southern California thoroughfare name-checked in his classic ""Free Fallin'"" to pay tribute to the dearly departed singer.

Petty, who left music lovers stunned and saddened with his sudden death on Oct. 2 , painted a vivid lyrical portrait of late '80s life around Los Angeles in ""Free Fallin',"" including a number of references to local landmarks — like the line ""All the vampires walking through the valley / Move west down Ventura Boulevard.""

That particular lyric inspired local artist and jeweler Mary Soracco to organize yesterday's ""vampire walk"" as an eerily fitting birthday celebration.

""My friends were joking with me how I wasn't a Tom Petty fan before this, but how can I not be a fan after this?"" Soracco told the Los Angeles Daily News . ""I love L.A., and he loved L.A., and that's the reason why I'm doing this.""

You can see video from the event above, and some photos below.

The paper estimated up to 300 people turned out for the walk, which included a Petty lookalike leading members of the crowd through singalong renditions of some of his greatest hits. While at least one individual interviewed by the Daily News admitted they'd never heard of Petty before getting caught up in the celebration, most attendees professed a deep and longstanding love of his music — and pointed to the California connection in particular.

""My husband told me we got a place in Reseda, and I said okay without having seen it because of Tom Petty,"" one walker told the News . ""I'm his biggest fan.""

257107,False,1024,"I file onto Alitalia flight 649 — a direct flight from Rome, Italy to Caracas, Venezuela — groggy from the Wednesday morning dawn, irritable from the usual array of micro-inconveniences that comprise modern day air travel. My seat is 14L, a window. I get to my row and a short, pudgy Italian man in 14K pops up to allow me in. He's all smiles — one of those ""morning people"" I suppose.

He has a beach-ball belly, probably mid-60's, ear-length hair parted down the middle, with 70's-style, slightly tinted thick-rimmed glasses on. He looked like a Serpico-era Al Pacino that grew grey and rotund and forgot to change his clothes for the last three decades.

I sit. He retakes his seat next to me. He lunges over the armrest to begin talking to me, clearly breaching the invisible, unspoken demarcation of personal space between two airplane seats. He corners me with his small talk: Hello, where are you from? Oh you speak Spanish? Beautiful morning, isn't it? Are you on vacation? What do you do? Are you staying in Caracas? Oh how nice, I'm an actor.

Each word launches torpedoes of halitosis-laden air toward me; the man has possibly the most vile breath my lungs have ever confronted. I begin inching my head back farther and farther away from him, but the entire region is crop-dusted. He leans — no, invades — the invisible armrest-border into my territory, besieging me and my comfy 14L leather-chair empire, blanketing me with his esophageal stench and pleasantries; Markantinople is burning, burning with the stench of old man, ransacked and pillaged, subjected to wave after wave of non-conversation.

I retreat into my backpack and offer him a stick of gum. Disaster averted. I then counterattack by putting my seat back and nudging him off my side of the armrest. He's off-balance, chewing contently; the onslaught has abated. Then I make my move. I quickly follow up the seat-back jab with a combination right-hook of headphones in my ears and iPod on, and before he can gather himself, I blast the music and close my eyes. Uppercut.

It seems all is well and the flight will proceed as normal. But maybe 15 minutes later I feel a tap on my shoulder. I ignore it. The tap turns into pointy-fingered jab. WHAT!?!?! I open my eyes and zombie Al Pacino's face is hovering close to mine again, way over on my side — further, even — as he pantomimes silent words underneath the music. I pull my left earbud out, making every effort to not hide my irritation at him, I ask him the most angry Qué? I can muster.

More small talk. But this time it comes in cool mint.

Eventually, through Herculean efforts of passive-aggression and feigned sleep, I get him to stop talking and to (mostly) stop touching me. But he's ceded no territory. He's now spread himself across the armrest with his knee jabbing into my long thigh, the borders have been redrawn, the geopolitical tensions between 14K and 14L remain tense.

And as with any active border dispute, peace is a mirage, conflict is never far away. An hour passes. Awake and now eating, the Italian man, the Roman invader, the unrepentant Caesar, turns to me and reinitiates diplomatic communication. Am I married? he asks.

No, I'm not. Are you?

He was for fifteen years he says. But not anymore. He's ""free"" now, he says, extra emphasis on ""free,"" — libré, he adds special accent to the end of the word for emphasis.

I offer a generic platitude in return: ""That's great, it can be great to be single. ""

""Yes,"" he says, ""I can fuck whomever I want.""

I try not to betray how awkward his last statement was, so I nod lightly and return my gaze to my food, my cold pasta suddenly mesmerizing me.

He leans over again, now launching an artillery of spittle and bread crumbs all over me, he looks me in the eye. The old bastard is serious: ""True freedom is when you can fuck whomever you want.""

Despite my past in writing thousands of words on promiscuity, dabbling in polyamory and defending the merits of casual sex at length, I somehow find myself utterly repulsed and speechless.

The National Football League said Tuesday it will end its tax-exempt status, squashing one of America's most baffling corporate tax breaks and granting the mega-business more secrecy about its inner financial workings.

The change will mean the NFL's head office, which earned revenues of about $327 million in 2013, will have to pay taxes on its income. But the football juggernaut will no longer have to file yearly tax forms that publicly disclose details like executive pay, including for commissioner Roger Goodell, who made $44 million in 2012.

In a letter dated Tuesday to team owners and members of Congress, Goodell called the decades-old tax-exempt status a ""distraction"" that has ""been mischaracterized repeatedly,"" and whose end ""will make no material difference to our business.""

""The fact is that the business of the NFL has never been tax exempt,"" Goodell wrote. ""Every dollar of income generated through television rights fees, licensing agreements, sponsorships, ticket sales, and other means is earned by the 32 clubs and is taxable there.""

Since 1942, America's biggest sports empire has qualified as a 501(c)(6) non-profit, the same designation given to business leagues, trade groups and organizations like the American Medical Association. Central bodies for hockey and golf, the National Hockey League (NHL) and The PGA Tour, also file as nonprofits, because the tax code says they work to promote their industries, not as for-profit enterprises.

The NFL has defended its nonprofit status by pointing out all of its teams are for-profit entities, and the billions they make from TV contracts, tickets sales and merchandise are already taxed. Earlier this month, an NFL spokesman The Washington Post that the league office ""has always been a nonprofit because it does not engage in income-producing or profit-making activity."" The NFL has defended its nonprofit status by pointing out all of its teams are for-profit entities, and the billions they make from TV contracts, tickets sales and merchandise are already taxed. Earlier this month, an NFL spokesman told The Washington Postthat the league office ""has always been a nonprofit because it does not engage in income-producing or profit-making activity.""

But congressional leaders have routinely questioned whether sports leagues deserve the tax break. ""For every dollar that goes out in a case like this, that's a dollar my constituents have to pay in income taxes,"" said Maine's independent Sen. Angus King last year.

The NFL is following a similar play by Major League Baseball, which opted to forgo its tax-exempt status in 2007. The National Basketball Association (NBA) and NASCAR both file as for-profit companies.

Just how much the NFL's headquarters in New York will need to start forking over in taxes remains unclear. A congressional committee Just how much the NFL's headquarters in New York will need to start forking over in taxes remains unclear. A congressional committee estimated the NFL would need to pay about $10 million in taxes, a drop in the bucket for a league where team revenues add up to nearly $10 billion a year.

But the NFL's executives will gain cover from criticism over their paychecks. The league's 2013 tax filing revealed that, besides Goodell's $44 million, six other executives drew seven-figure salaries and 298 employees made $100,000 or more.

Some lawmakers on Tuesday celebrated the shift. Sen. Maria Cantwell (D-Wash.), who last year called for stripping the NFL of its nonprofit status because of its refusal to force the Washington Redskins to change the club's controversial name, called it a ""victory for tax payers, and a long overdue step."" She added, however, that dropping the tax break ""doesn't mean you can ignore the need for the NFL to abandon a racial slur as a team name.""

Not everyone was so congratulatory. Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) said in a statement Tuesday that the league's ""sacrifice of its tax-exempt status seems more like a PR stunt than a real gain.""",0.0,0.7474012521482478,-1.0,-0.1

257282,True,501,"Abstract

CONTEXT: Previous epidemiological, animal, and human cognitive neuroscience research suggests that maternal smoking during pregnancy (SDP) causes increased risk of substance use/problems in offspring.

OBJECTIVE: To determine the extent to which the association between SDP and offspring substance use/problems depends on confounded familial background factors by using a quasi-experimental design.

DESIGN: We used 2 separate samples from the United States and Sweden. The analyses prospectively predicted multiple indices of substance use and problems while controlling for statistical covariates and comparing differentially exposed siblings to minimize confounding.

SETTING: Offspring of a representative sample of women in the United States (sample 1) and the total Swedish population born during the period from January 1, 1983, to December 31, 1995 (sample 2).

PATIENTS OR OTHER PARTICIPANTS: Adolescent offspring of the women in the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1979 (n = 6904) and all offspring born in Sweden during the 13-year period (n = 1,187,360).

MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Self-reported adolescent alcohol, cigarette, and marijuana use and early onset (before 14 years of age) of each substance (sample 1) and substance-related convictions and hospitalizations for an alcohol- or other drug-related problem (sample 2).

RESULTS: The same pattern emerged for each index of substance use/problems across the 2 samples. At the population level, maternal SDP predicted every measure of offspring substance use/problems in both samples, ranging from adolescent alcohol use (hazard ratio [HR](moderate), 1.32 [95% CI, 1.22-1.43]; HR(high), 1.33 [1.17-1.53]) to a narcotics-related conviction (HR(moderate), 2.23 [2.14-2.31]; HR(high), 2.97 [2.86-3.09]). When comparing differentially exposed siblings to minimize genetic and environmental confounds, however, the association between SDP and each measure of substance use/problems was minimal and not statistically significant.

CONCLUSIONS: The association between maternal SDP and offspring substance use/problems is likely due to familial background factors, not a causal influence, because siblings have similar rates of substance use and problems regardless of their specific exposure to SDP.",0.5868858833131786,0.6868858833131786,0.0,-0.1

""Tea is like a beautiful woman,"" says Nirmal Sethia.

""You look for the deep characteristics. There's no need to concentrate on the appearance.""

For someone who has worked in the tea industry for more than 50 years, Anglo-Indian businessman Nirmal Sethia has lost none of his passion for the drink.

Now in his 70s, he also still takes tea very seriously. ""Tea is life,"" he says. ""Tea is religion, tea is music.""

The co-founder and boss of upmarket brand Newby Teas, Mr Sethia's relationship with tea started in London after the end of World War Two.

However, Mr Sethia, the son of a successful third-generation Indian businessman, initially just wanted to have fun in life.

Looking back on his teenage years, he says: ""I was a rebel.

""I used to see all the boys smoking in London and wanted some of that. Smoking, and drinking, and girls looked exciting to me, even at 13.""

It was then that he told his father that he didn't want to go to school any more.

""I knew that route wasn't for me. I didn't want to do exams, and wanted something more exciting.""

Image copyright NK Sethia Image caption The teenage Nirmal Sethia initially had other interests

A chance encounter one day with someone who worked in a tea supplier led to Mr Sethia becoming an apprentice tea taster for one of the biggest tea merchants in London, something he believes was the hand of God guiding him.

""It was my first lucky break,"" he says. ""Divine intervention I suppose.

""Someone I knew saw me smoking outside the tea offices, and seemed to see something in me. He worked there and introduced me to the boss.""

'No money'

That first encounter on a London street in the late 1950s started a lifelong love affair with tea for Mr Sethia.

He was soon working for one of biggest tea importers in the Republic of Ireland as a buyer in India, tasked with buying tea at auctions in Kolkata (formerly called Calcutta).

Image copyright Newby Teas Image caption Mr Sethia says tea drinking should never be rushed

His father was impressed with how his son had taken to working in the tea industry, and encouraged him to do more.

So with his dad's support, the young Nirmal Sethia started his own business - Sethia Tea Estates - from the family's home in Kolkata, buying and selling teas from all over the world, for tea merchants the length and breadth of the UK and Republic of Ireland.

By then tea had really taken over his life, and Mr Sethia bought a tea plantation in the north eastern Indian state of Assam.

""I didn't have any money [left over]... I used to sleep on the veranda of one of the buildings in the tea garden and drink tea,"" he says.

""I taught myself about the different characteristics and subtleties in flavour.

I seemed to have a gift for tasting tea. I was able to distinguish and discern teas from different parts of India and beyond, something that impressed the buyers I met.""

Wife's support

Having made a success of his tea business, Mr Sethia's destiny took a different path in 1965 when he started his own company dealing in jute, a vegetable fibre used to make rope and bags.

He says: ""My uncle was running the family business, but I didn't think he was doing a very good job of it.

""I thought I could do better. The arrogance of youth, I suppose.

""I went to my father who loved the idea of me thinking I could do better than his brother. The sparkle in his eye assured me I had to make this business a success, which I did.""

This new company, N Sethia Group, became Mr Sethia's main interest and over the years has expanded across a number of business sectors, including banking and property.

However, his love of tea remained. Fast forward a few decades, and tea was once again to come knocking at his door.

255910,True,696,"MUZAFFARPUR: There is many a slip between a cup and the lip. This proverb holds true of Shahi litchi crop in Muzaffarpur district this year. The crop, which was developing in a normal way till a month back due to favourable weather conditions, has been damaged upto 40% in general due to abnormal rise in temperature, hot westerly wind, total absence of rain and sharp fall in humidity just 20 days prior to its harvesting.Fruit harvesting has been delayed by a week and if the growers wait for another three to five days more, it might assume the normal reddish colour and its pulp may gain more weight because of the easterly wind which has started blowing since Saturday morning. This is for the first time in the last 15 years that no rainfall has been recorded in the district in May so far.While moving in Jhapaha orchard of Bholanath Jha on Saturday morning, the principal scientist of National Litchi Research Centre, Muzaffarpur, S K Purve said 40% of crop has been burnt by heat wave in Bochaha-Mushahari belt as the absentee orchard owners could not adopt proper safety measures to save their crops from excessive heat. On the other hand, he was satisfied to see bunches of normal sized litchi resting on the ground. This, he said, was only because of the constant care taken by Jha to save the fruit. He said in such orchards, one quintal of litchi is possible from each tree. Adopting scientific methods for the growth of the crop never goes unrewarded, Purve remarked.Litchi grower Jha, who had received the award of 'Udyan Ratna' from the state government a few years back, said farmers have to grow high-rise creepers around the orchard or cover it with other dense leafy trees particularly on the western side to protect this hot-weather fruit from excessive heat. Efforts to keep the orchard cool as far as possible helps the fruit in getting normal size, sweetness, aroma and colour.Jha said the abnormal rise in temperature has affected the size of the fruit this year, in general. Weight of each piece is only 14 to 15 grams whereas it should have been 20 to 25 gm. Litchi has the capacity to tolerate the temperature up to 38 degree but has crossed 40 degree in the last 15 days. The minimum humidity the fruit can sustain is 50, but it fell down to 17 to 20% during the pre-harvest period. That is why the traders of Mumbai have rejected the first consignment of litchi and have asked the growers to wait for five days more.Plucking of litchi has started in most of the orchards. It is being sold at Rs 100 per 100 piece in the local market whereas it was only Rs 60 last year. 'China' variety is expected to give good return to the growers and traders but it does not have the aroma of Shahi variety. 'China' variety's harvesting is expected after a week. The litchi season will come to an end by June 15.The NLRC is trying to extend this season up to July end but it might take another five years.

256560,True,951,"Senate support grows for Iran deal

President Barack Obama's Iran deal looks increasingly likely to survive a challenge from congressional Republicans after several swing Democrats said they would back the deal just as the Senate sped toward recess on Wednesday.

Minutes after Senate leaders locked in an agreement to begin debating the nuclear deal on Sept. 8, Independent Maine Sen. Angus King came to the floor to announce his support for the agreement. King's decision will make it hard for GOP opponents to block the lifting of legislative sanctions when the Senate votes no later than Sept. 17.

Story Continued Below

""This is the most difficult decision I've ever had to make,"" King said. ""But in the end I decided the terms of this agreement are preferable to the alternatives.""

In addition to King, Democratic Sens. Bill Nelson of Florida and Tim Kaine of Virginia also voiced support for the deal this week. Their support is invaluable for the White House: The trio of Democratic Caucus members were early backers of the review law that allows Congress to hold an up or down vote on the deal. And their support transforms the whip-counting operation for Republicans hoping to block the deal.

While there are technically enough undecided Democrats for the GOP to marshal a veto-proof majority against the deal, many are reliable allies of the administration and are expected to back the agreement. More skeptical senators like Chuck Schumer of New York or Robert Menendez of New Jersey could still end up voting against the Iran deal and bring some colleagues with them, but the battle for votes appears to be a race to 60 instead of 67.

If Republicans can get at least six Democrats to support their cause in the Senate to break a filibuster, it would still be a significant achievement for the GOP. Sanctions on Iran would stay in place for 22 more days as Obama vetoed the disapproval resolution and Congress voted to override a veto, and a 60-vote bloc is always difficult to build. But it wouldn't be enough to block the deal.

Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) came to the Senate floor on Wednesday afternoon and sounded like he'd made a decision. But Flake, who Obama is aggressively courting to support the deal, still said he was undecided.

""I can only support an agreement that can endure,"" he said as he left the floor with a long summer recess and a big decision ahead of him.

With senators antsy to begin their August recess after a mostly fruitless week, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) and Minority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) reached an agreement to start consideration of the Iran deal as soon as lawmakers return from the break. They also agreed on a process to finish a cybersecurity bill, but it could be months before that gets a vote in the Senate.

McConnell has said he hopes that all 100 senators participate in the Iran discussion while at their desks and has suggested that all committee hearings be canceled during the deliberations.

Reid, in a rare moment of comity between the two rival leaders, said: ""The debate we're going to have in a matter of weeks, I want it to be … dignified, befitting the gravity of the issue of the day. This is a step forward.""

Locking in the debate before breaking for the recess was a necessity with Rosh Hashanah disrupting the few days that the Senate will be in session in September. Under the agreement, the Senate will have no more than seven days to debate the Iran bill before proceeding to a vote.

On Wednesday alone there were four planned briefings and hearings on the Iran deal, with an evening classified briefing between senators and State Department official Wendy Sherman and Energy Secretary Ernest Moniz expected to cap off the summer schedule until September.

Senate Republicans indicated this week they are planning for a vote on a resolution of disapproval for the deal with Iran. If the GOP determines it cannot get 60 votes behind that resolution, then they could put a resolution of approval up for a vote with the intention of it failing and embarrassing Obama, sources said.

The final text of the resolution that the Senate will vote on has not been publicly released. This week the House released its disapproval resolution, and Republicans said they already have enough votes to pass it.

But after several startling defections from New York House Democrats, like Steve Israel, Obama got some good news from the other side of the Capitol as well on Wednesday. Rep. Dan Kildee (D-Mich.), who has a constituent held in Iran, announced he'd back the deal as well.

""No one has presented a credible alternative,"" Kildee said.",0.7599881648490884,0.7599881648490884,0.0,0.0
258575,True,892,"New St. Pete Pier

For the second time in two years, St. Petersburg, Florida, is looking to transform its pier into a destination park.

Is the pier park the new riverwalk? For years, it seemed that all cities could talk about were waterfront developments. Encouraged by the success seen in San Antonio above all, cities such as Philadelphia and Milwaukee have invested in their own historic riverwalk programs. Riverwalks aren't going anywhere. (Philadelphia, in particular, is ramping up to build some dramatic developments along the Schuylkill River.) But in several cities—namely New York, London, and Washington, D.C.—the most exciting new water-themed developments are taking a different shape. In Florida, St. Petersburg has just announced eight finalist designs for the city's proposed New St. Pete Pier, the latest iteration of the historic St. Petersburg Pier. First built in 1889 as a railroad tressle, the city's pier has evolved several times over the last 125 years. The finalist designs under consideration are below. There's one problem with these pier designs: St. Petersburg has tried to build this kind of pier park before. And only last year, it was struck down by residents.

Yet the Concerned Citizens of St. Pete, the organization that rallied the opposition to the Lens proposal, appears to approve of the next-generation round of finalists currently under consideration. What the latest designs share in common—and what distinguishes the eight finalists from the Lens design approved in 2012 and overruled in 2013—is the preservation of the signature Inverted Pyramid design built back in 1973.

This saga is quite different from the NIMBY-style opposition that's greeted some reuse projects attempted by U.S. cities in recent years. For starters, St. Petersburg was ahead of the curve: Decades before the High Line opened, the city had already converted an aging piece of infrastructure into a cultural amenity. And that's the pier that people liked. The Concerned Citizens of St. Pete disapproved of Michael Maltzan's design specifically, and of changing the Inverted Pyramid scheme generally. Voters seemed to agree with the Concerned Citizens. While pro-Lens activists complained that the ballot referendum was poorly worded—asking voters to vote yes in order to say no—nearly two-thirds did so nevertheless. The preservation requirement for the 1973 Inverted Pyramid pavilion may prove to be a burden on the site, limiting its potential as a new landmark destination. After all, the New St. Pete Pier still has to do all the things required of a brand new pier park, such as Pier 44 in New York (designed by Heatherwick Studio) or the 11th Street Bridge Park in D.C. (designed by OMA and OLIN)—just without a fancy design scheme to carry all those new features.

Consider Destination St. Pete Pier, one of the eight finalists. The legend for the diagram includes (but is not limited to): a fishing pier, tram stops, a water taxi stop, kayak docks, a ""Grand Hammock,"" restaurants, waterfalls, a small-event lawn, retail, and other kinds of spaces. All of these new uses are anchored to a central design that St. Petersburg has lived with for decades. This design entry isn't alone in reusing the Inverted Pyramid scheme. (Some of the finalists offer more pronounced adaptations.) Like all the other finalists, this one adds tons and tons of programming to the pier. It seems to be a requirement of off-shore parks that they offer all things to all people. ""As you walk toward the Pier Head, you will encounter a new, unique St. Petersburg experience every 60 seconds,"" the entry promises. What remains to be seen is whether St. Petersburg can build enough support for what may be, in the end, a pricey renovation of a 1970s design. Now, the city will ask residents to rally around a more modest scheme, one that includes all the bells but none of the whistles, as it were. This approach might very well work. (And St. Petersburg deserved kudos for pivoting fast to a new plan for addressing the pier, whose pyramid is aging and pier approach crumbling.) If the scaled-down pier park concept fails to inspire people, though, the city might be out of options.",0.0,0.7423905461888738,-1.1,0.0
255111,True,548,"Save their lives, or build a border wall?

Donald Trump would like for the United States to spend $1.1 billion less on HIV-treatment programs in sub-Saharan Africa, and $524 million less on contraception for the global poor.

On the plus side, these cuts will make it easier to finance the president's border wall, which he hopes to spend $1.6 billion on in 2018.

On the downside:

At least one million people will die in sub-Saharan Africa and elsewhere, researchers and advocates said on Tuesday, if funding cuts proposed by the Trump administration to global public health programs are enacted.


… With a huge share of Africa's population reaching sexual maturity in the next four years, the virus could again imperil much of the continent if fewer people are treated, said Brian Honermann, deputy director at amfAR, a foundation that invests in AIDS research.


AIDS treatment not only keeps people alive but prevents them from spreading the virus to others, Mr. Honermann noted. ""If you cut the funding by this much, I think there's a real risk we will backslide, and a whole lot more people will become infected,"" he said.

These cuts almost certainly won't happen. The President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (Pepfar) — America's primary program for funding HIV treatment — is one of George W. Bush's (only) signature achievements, and enjoys strong, bipartisan support.

So, it's tempting to dismiss these eye-popping death-toll estimates as irrelevant — ultimately, the Trump budget is just Mick Mulvaney's (sloppily executed) math homework, not an actual governing document.

But such nonchalance is wrongheaded. And not only because Trump's budget functions as an expression of his (monstrous) values.

The president may be unlikely to cut $1 billion from AIDS treatment, but his budget makes it clear that he will not be adding any more money to such programs. And that latter fact is about as morally objectionable as the first.

The Global Fund estimates that every $100 million invested in HIV treatment saves about 133,000 lives. Currently, the United States — the wealthiest country in human history — spends $6 billion annually on AIDS programs. The Pentagon recently spent $125 billion on (what its own internal study deemed) ""administrative waste.""

Our nation could easily afford to save hundreds of thousands more people from preventable deaths. When we choose instead to cut taxes for the rich — and/or spend $1 trillion on the F-35 — we are choosing to let them die.",0.7181351107703976,0.8181351107703976,-0.1,0.0

Clinton, who is expected to receive the presidential nomination from the US Democratic Party next month, released a broad technology and innovation agenda yesterday in which her campaign argued that US public policy should include work with blockchain.

The Clinton campaign stated:

""We must position American innovators to lead the world in the next generation of technology revolutions – from autonomous vehicles to machine learning to public service blockchain applications – and we must defend universal access to the global, digital marketplace of ideas.""

The Clinton campaign also indicated that the presumptive Democratic nominee will, if elected, push for reduced regulatory barriers for startups and entrepreneurs.

""Hillary will challenge state and local governments to identify, review and reform legal and regulatory obligations that protect legacy incumbents against new innovators,"" the campaign said.

The comments make Clinton the latest major US political candidate to offer support for blockchain technology and its surrounding industry.

Fun for boys and girls.

Fanservice trope, and a subtrope of Marshmallow Hell and Accidental Pervert. Someone turns to leave, is running without looking where they're going or trips over (if they are One Head Taller)... and buries their face directly into someone's feminine assets, pushing it apart with the same effect as a car's airbag deploying and absorbing the shock. Sometimes they bounce off, sometimes they get stuck. even if they're not stuck, it's common for them to stay in that position at least long enough to exchange initial greetings.

What differentiates this from Marshmallow Hell is:

It's never intentional, on either side. Whether or not people who were watching think otherwise is part of the joke.

Can happen to both genders — in fact, since the stationary woman has to be one and a half heads taller, women tend to be the primary demographic. (See the MegaTokyo pic to the right.)

This article, now modified to reflect more recent developments, was originally published on October 27, 2013, in Italian, in the newspaper Il Foglio.

Names and minor details have been altered to protect the identity of sources.

""Now starts the evening symphony: bom bom, smatter smatter."" The shelling could go on for hours, a throaty baritone emanating from Bashar al Assad's artillery bases that ring Damascus. Many people across Syria's capital city report the same thing. This time, the woman describing this fury to me is not the recipient of this rage. Many of her patients, however, are not as lucky.

Catherine (a pseudonym) works in a charity day clinic which provides medical attention to those who could not otherwise afford it, especially mothers, and children. But what she is seeing now is a horrifying new reality in Damascus. Surrounded by war and shut off from the suburbs because of government checkpoints, many of the clinic's patients are refugees who fled into the capital to stay with family before the worst of the violence started. She learns about the conditions just a few kilometers away from those who still have family there, ""and from the newly arrived. Workers families mostly live in the outskirts of town and in small villages. I made field trips to check families."" Now, however, Catherine and others can't reach outside of the city.

The situation just outside of the center of Damascus is dire. In Moadamiyah, just a few kilometers west of where Syria's President sleeps, the town is sealed off from the outside world by artillery fire, snipers, bombing runs, and government checkpoints. Unable to flee the violence, and unable to get food into the city, there have now been four documented cases of children starving to death (and rising). During the shelling, water pipelines have been destroyed, turning even drinking water into a commodity. In recent days, the regime and the rebels have tried to broker a peace in order to evacuate civilians. Those efforts have met with mixed results. The New York Times documented more chaos on last week, as civilians trying to flee the suburb were killed by incoming artillery fire. But as journalist Michael Weiss reports in his thorough examination of the situation in Moadamiyah, even when civilians escape, their suffering does not end there:

[Last week], locals were able to get around 600 women, children and seniors out of Moadamiyah after a cease-fire was brokered with the regime. They were taken to Qusaya, a Damascus town completely controlled by Assadist forces where the inevitable happened, according to Zakarya [a rebel spokesman in the town]: 10 children were kidnapped by intelligence agents and beaten into confessing information about the whereabouts of FSA fighters and activists inside Moadamiyah. ""Four of these kids were released after 10 hours and told us the story,"" Zakarya said. ""Another six are still missing."" Power outages mean communicating with those outside the town is difficult. Zakarya said that to fuel his cellphone, which he was using to talk to me, car and scooter batteries were rigged up as homemade generators.

On October 29th, 1800 civilians were ""evacuated"" from Moadamiyah, a humanitarian effort orchestrated by the Catholic nun, Mother Agnes Mariam. However, this nun, an apologist for the Assad regime, once again betrayed the trust of those who cooperated with her. According to a new report, several hundred of those who fled starvation were not taken to receive medical treatment, but were brought to the Mezzeh airforce base, where they will be interrogated. As the starvation worsens inside Moadamiyah, the situation that its refugees face may be just as brutal.

Moadamiyah has received significant press attention, and this past Friday opposition protesters in the northern Syrian town of Kafranbel held up protest banners to call attention to the starvation there. One banner read, in English, ""Should anyone have to eat cats and dogs to survive?"" Another mimicked the famous photograph that Kevin Carter took in Sudan, showing a vulture waiting to feast on a starving child. Things are so bad there that Moadamiyah has become a rallying cry for the opposition, and a symbol of the world's indifference.

But the area affected is now much wider than Moadamiyah. Children are starving to death across a ring that nearly encircles the capital. There have been confirmed starvation deaths in the south of the capital as well, in Hajira al Balad and Hajar al Aswad, and even in Douma to the northeast. All of the documented fatalities, so far, are children. Other children are shown in desperate pleas posted on Youtube, skinny, dirty, and without hope that their situations will improve any time soon.

255028,True,512,"The Coalition For Economic Survival (CES) urges a NO vote on Measure S, on the March 7, 2017 Los Angeles City ballot

CES believes Measure S threatens to delay or stop projects that would otherwise provide affordable housing, and housing for homeless people.

Measure S puts a two-year moratorium on development projects requiring certain zoning or height exemptions, and permanently prohibits developments requiring a general plan amendment. Thus, it could stop projects that would provide permanent supportive housing for people that are homeless – housing that voters approved with the passage of Measure HHH last November.

Clearly, there is a great need for government action to protect neighborhoods and much more action is needed to preserve our existing rent controlled and affordable housing stock. In fact, this lack of action at City Hall, no doubt, opened the door for Measure S to make it to the ballot.

Measure S does have some good provisions. The City should be updating community plans. Obviously, in response to Measure S, the City Council just voted to back an effort to update community plans more frequently.

Additionally, developers should not be allowed to select environmental impact report consultants for their projects.

But, it is our belief that Measure S is a sledgehammer approach that does not provide a solution. In fact, it may make matters worse.

Measure S is not the answer and should be voted down.

Measure S

Does Not Stop Ellis Act evictions

Does Not Stop condo conversions

Does Not Stop rent controlled housing being demolished. In fact it may led to the destruction of rent controlled buildings.

Does Not Create new affordable housing

Does Not Stop big developers from donating to elected officials

Measure S DOES Stop Affordable Housing from Being Built

Measure S would provide an incentive to developer to destroy more rent controlled buildings.

A two year moratorium on development targeted in Measure S could steer developers towards other types of development such as more demolitions and conversions of rent controlled housing to condos resulting in further displacement of low and moderate income renters.

The Measure S moratorium, and its permanent prohibition on the City's ability to issue general plan amendments, will be stop the building of affordable housing. Although the backers of Measure S claim to exempt affordable housing, Measure S does not actually exempt all 100% affordable housing projects from its reach, and would effectively stop 90% of city-sponsored affordable housing projects.

It is for these reasons CES Urges You to Vote NO on Measure S!

Oregon won at Tennessee, 48-13 in 2010, in the only other meeting between the schools, made memorable by the lightning delay and then two 70-yard-plus scoring plays by sophomores LaMichael James and Cliff Harris. Ten Ducks, though no starters, are still around for today�s rematch. For the Volunteers, defensive end Corey Miller and right tackle Ju�Wuan James started against the Ducks in 2010, and fellow senior Michael Palardy handled UT�s kickoffs then and is its full-time placekicker now.

You look remarkably like an empty seat

This will be Oregon�s 91st consecutive sellout (cough, cough) at Autzen Stadium, dating back to 1999. Only Nebraska, which hosts UCLA at 9 a.m. today, with 327 consecutive sellouts dating to 1962, and Notre Dame (232 since 1973) have longer streaks.

SEC wins the football trivia battle, too

The Southeastern Conference weekly press release provides this nugget on Tennessee QB Justin Worley, who�s making his sixth start today. In his three wins, he�s completed 70 percent of his passes with five touchdowns and just one interception; in his two losses, he dropped to 45.5 percent, no TDs and three picks.

Familiarity breeds except among zebras

Game Notes hates being wrong almost as much as putting its name to the end of this filler, but so it goes. Last week�s Oregon game at Virginia was not officiated by an ACC crew, as stated last week. Instead, it was a Pac-12 seven headed by referee Shawn Hochuli, the son of NFL ref Ed Hochuli. At some point, college football needs to standardize its officiating to get past the regional paranoia, because sending seven guys making nearly $1,500 per game (pay and per diem) cross country for a nonconference game makes little sense. And after 11 penalties for 119 yards against Virginia, compared with five for 33 in the Fiesta Bowl with ACC refs on patrol last January, maybe the Ducks would have preferred the Pac-12 boys stayed home, too.

Great play that should have won our day

We also whiffed last week on what should have been the special teams play-of-the-game story. How badly? Our X�s & O�s guy in his postgame blog called it a blocked field goal, which if started at the Virginia 14-yard line would have made it a 103-yard attempt. Fortunately, our own Chris Pietsch captured an excellent photo for your Sunday paper of Josh Huff�s punt block that set up Oregon�s second touchdown. Virginia�s �shield� formation gave UO special teams coach Tom Osborne plenty to exploit, and Huff, a gifted senior wide receiver, did the rest on the Ducks� five-man, jail-break rush against horrifically bad blocking. It was �Win the Day� in action at its finest, and it deserved more notice.

Paging Matt Barkley to the Eagles sideline

Amid the spasms of joy over the Oregon Way having taken the NFL by storm last Monday night, did anyone notice that Washington came within a successful onside kick of nearly beating the Philadelphia Eagles and robbing Chip Kelly�s game ball from beneath his chinny-chin-chin? Over-under on Michael Vick�s up-rightness this season: 10 games. Nick Foles? Two.

There�s seven of �em and they�re back again

The conference has the same seven officiating crew chiefs for the third straight season. Pac-12 refs worked 13 of the 19 games involving conference teams the first two weeks. Game Notes likes to monitor such things for silly reasons, such as maybe a 91/2-yard onside kick showing up again someday.

Orlando City Soccer forward Cyle Larin was arrested early Thursday on a DUI charge, according to the Florida Highway Patrol. Orlando City Soccer forward Cyle Larin was arrested early Thursday on a DUI charge, according to the Florida Highway Patrol. SEE MORE VIDEOS

A state trooper saw Larin's Cadillac and pulled him over, the report stated.

An oncoming car stopped a few feet in front of Larin's vehicle, ""averting"" a head-on collision, troopers said.

He blew a .179 and a .182 on sobriety tests. The legal limit is .08.

Larin will undergo an assessment by MLS' Substance Abuse and Behavioral Health Program doctors, according to a statement released by MLS.

""He will not be eligible to participate in any competition or team activity until that assessment is complete, he is cleared for participation by the SABH Program doctors and MLS completes its investigation,"" the statement read. ""Major League Soccer will remain in close communication with Orlando City SC, local law enforcement, and the MLS Players Union during this investigation.""

MLS players in similar situations in the past have missed three or four games.

Orlando City followed the league's comment by saying all players, coaches and front office staff are held to a high standard because they represent the Orlando community and that the club is ""very disappointed in Cyle Larin's actions…and does not take this situation lightly.""

FHP released dash cam footage from his arrest.

Larin's car can be seen going the wrong way, passing vehicles and nearly hitting a vehicle head on as he stopped for the trooper. He was not speeding, according to troopers, and pulled over right away.

He told the trooper the car nearly hit him.

""You're on the wrong side of the road,"" the trooper replied.

Larin responded that he didn't know that and he was from Canada.

At first he told the trooper he did not have anything to drink, but later said he had two or three.

He was with a female passenger. They said they were coming from Club ONO in downtown Orlando.

""I play for Orlando City,"" he told the trooper. ""I was just trying to drive her home.""

FHP Sgt. Kim Montes said Larin was cooperative throughout the investigation and did not try to use his status as a soccer star to get out of the arrest.

He did ask to make a phone call to the team's security staff.

""They just work for us, so if we get pulled over, we can call them so we can sort out the situation,"" he said.

Montes said there are too many options for drivers today such as ride sharing or taxi's to be driving impaired.

She said the situation could have ended up worse than it did.

""If he had continued driving the wrong way down Orange Avenue we very well could have had a head-on collision,"" she said. ""The trooper was at the right place at the right time … and luckily prevented a crash.""

His eyes were bloodshot and glossy, troopers said, and he had ""difficulty"" answering their questions. Larin also struggled to complete the field sobriety exercises.

22-year-old Cyle Larin, who is one of Orlando City's star soccer players, was arrested early Thursday, June 15, 2017, after driving the wrong way on an Orlando street, according to the Florida Highway Patrol.

He was taken to the Orange County Jail, where he has since bonded out. He had nothing to say to reporters.

Records show Larin had to complete a four-hour drivers training course twice — once after a speeding ticket in 2015 and a second earlier this year after failing to follow a traffic device. Both offenses occurred in Orange County.

Orlando City selected Larin No. 1 overall in the 2015 MLS SuperDraft. He signed a professional contract after playing two years at the University of Connecticut.

Larin immediately delivered for the Lions, scoring 17 goals in their inaugural MLS season on his way to being named 2015 Rookie of the Year.

He followed that up with 14 goals in 2016, solidifying himself as one of the league's most productive strikers and garnering significant interest from clubs overseas. Though transfer rumors swirled during the offseason, Larin insisted it was not yet time to leave Orlando and returned to the city for the 2017 MLS season.

A soft-spoken young player who rarely draws attention outside of the pitch, Larin is on pace to break his previous scoring record. He has eight goals in 15 games so far",0.0,0.7838705188129097,-1.8,-0.1
258921,True,434,"Bitcoin has been going strong since the past few weeks. The cryptocurrency which was priced at around $640 in mid-October has surged past the $700 mark and now stands at $725, after falling to $690 briefly over the weekend. At the current pace, the price of Bitcoin reaching $800 is imminent.

As to the reason behind the recent increase in price, the largest since June 2016 is the constant demand for Bitcoin in the Chinese market. Lately, China has been witnessing an increased capital outflow despite strict capital controls. According to available data, the country is leaking money for over two straight years due to weakening yuan. China's foreign exchange reserves are said to be plummeting at a drastic pace as more people rush to buying foreign assets.

Most of the capital outflows are attributed to two factors: one, where the exporters from the mainland are keeping their money in offshore, and the other where people are buying Bitcoin to prevent their assets from depreciating with yuan; and also for cross-border investments and transactions.

With an estimated total of over $573.2 billion in the capital outflow from China this year (Citigroup Global Markets' estimate), the half yearly numbers stood at around $286 billion. If the actual figures are in any way going to match the estimated numbers, then the demand for alternate currencies like Bitcoin is expected to only go up during the last two months of 2016.

Last month, Goldman Sachs warned China stating that the country's outflows may be worse than it appears to be. As yuan hit a 6-year low in October, the country continues to tighten its capital controls which may have driven not just the individuals and investors but also corporates to Bitcoin as the fear of depreciation looms over Chinese yuan.

The continued increase in demand for Bitcoin from various segments of the Chinese population will continue to reflect in the upward movement of the digital currency's price. It is just a matter of time before Bitcoin reaches $800 mark.

50 INCH 4K UHD LED TV

More on the UN50JU7100 UN50JU7100 Calibration and

Picture Settings

by Robert Wiley, Senior Editor

The 7-series LEDs from Samsung have been some of our favorite models over the past few years for its combination of excellent features and quality at a reasonable price. The JU7100 4K TV falls in the same category. Without going overboard with the very highest end features you get the ones you will appreciate most. These include UHD Picture Dimming, a quad core processor, contrast enhancer technology, precision black and peak illuminator picture quality adjustments. Also, the much upgraded Smart remote with touchpad and mic.

Picture Quality Rating: 90/100

""Light flow-through is exceptional and is one of the best traits of this TV""

As we've mentioned many times before, edge lit LED backlit LCDs are not the ideal picture technology, however Samsung's ultra clear coat screen is a big plus – especially from front and center of the screen. Light flow-through is exceptional and is one of the best traits of this TV. This is even more accentuated with the new Peak Illuminator technology employed which further accentuates light or bright areas of the screen. Images are clear and color information is accurate. Over time after use, some light bleed is likely to occur – noticeable during very dark or black background scenes. Colors pop very well for an LED TV and Samsung has the brightest LEDs (peak Whites) in the industry if you need a very bright screen. Last, the JU7100 includes a wide color enhancer plus technology for an expanded color pallet.

HD to UHD Upscaling and Conversion

Ever wonder if the picture quality is better on a 4K UHD TV with a standard definition or HD signal pumped into it? The answer is yes only if the TV has a stellar upscaling and conversion technology built in. And with very limited 4K content available, upscaling quality is extremely important. Otherwise, you might as well purchase a 1080p TV. We give the JU7100 an average score in this category. The JU7100 analyzes the incoming signal, applies video noise reduction techniques, and scales up the lower resolution signal. Lastly, it enhances the detail which may be the most important bit. With HD signals the JU7100 upscaler did a nice job improving the picture quality detail by 40% or so to attempt to put a number on it. With lower resolutions you get less benefit from the JU7100s 4K resolution. This is one of the key differences between some of the higher priced 4K TVs, the upscaler technology employed is more robust.

LED Edge Backlight – A Standout Feature

The light flow through created by the Samsung LED Backlights has been a major positive for the last couple of years and continues with this UHD offering. It's one of the TVs best characteristics. Some complain that it can cause screen uniformity issues. To tone down the LED backlight from causing some uneven screen uniformity issues turn the backlight setting (found in the picture settings menu) down to a more reasonable level – around 80% is what we recommend or even 70% if you are in a darker room. This will help keep screen uniformity and light bleed issues from arising and you still have plenty of brightness from this super bright LED TV. Having powerful LED backlighting in case you need it for super bright room conditions is a plus.

Side Angle Viewing – Still Room for Improvement "" To the untrained eye, you may not notice the contrast degradation occurring from wider angles as much as we do"" On the JU7100 Color and contrast do fade when viewing from off center though it is perhaps more subtle than in the past. The JU7100 is flat, but if you are super sensitive to the issue, possibly consider a curved screen, which does diminish side angle viewing weaknesses somewhat.

The second generation was a continuation of the legend the previous cars began. The third and final generation was and is a true supercar. Since 1979, the RX-7 has been one of the best performing and most unique cars on the road. Subject to misunderstanding and skepticism because of the unique rotary engine, these cars were always on the fringe of the automotive population. To drive an RX-7 is like driving no other car.

I doubt what's here is enough but for the most dedicated to go through the code to see how this works. REQUIREMENTS If you don't meet these requirements, then you probably won't get very far. The software was written in C (don't bother asking for Perl code---there isn't any, and there won't be any) and as such, makes certain assumptions, such as: * Linux (or any POSIX compilant UNIX system) * GCC (or any C99 compiler that may come with your system) * Apache * Lua 5.1 or higher The code right now assumes you'll be running this under Apache. COMPILATION You'll need to install my CGILIB library (6.6 or higher) to compile this blog software. You can install it from https://github.com/spc476/CGILib To install it once it's downloaded, all it should take is ""make"" and then ""make install"" as root. The library assumes a POSIX environment and should compile as is on most modern Unix systems. Once that is installed, you should be able to do a ""make"" and generate the blog engine. It's built as a setuid program to avoid having a world-writable directory, but if that is a concern, you can certain remove the setuid'ness of it, but make sure the data directories are writable by Apache. INSTALLATION The assumption on the blog engine is that the executable resides in a directory visible to Apache and runnable from within Apache's docroot for the the site in question. I have my copy named as ""boston.cgi"" and Apache configured to execute such programs via CGI. The htdocs/ subdirectory contains a sample website to run the blog. There's also a sample htaccess file that shows the method I use to run the blog engine. In the journal/ subdirectory is out-of-band files (which should not be served up by Apache). There you will find a sample configuration file and a sample entry to see how the data is stored (each entry is a separate file, stored under a Year/Month/Day directory structure). And yes, there is code to do email notifications, but it's not enabled by default. I only left the code in to support the half dozen people that did sign up to receive email notifications. The HTML entry form works, but it's not my primary method for new entries---for that, I use email.

This is supposed to be Eco-Earth's moment in the sun.

Once on the fringe of Riverfront Park, oftentimes forgotten, the massive mosaic tile sculpture now has a highly visible location near the landing of the new pedestrian and bicycle bridge that connects to Minto-Brown Island Park.

When the community celebrates the official opening of the Peter Courtney Minto Island Bridge on Wednesday, Aug. 2, the spotlight will expose the vulnerable state of the gigantic globe.

The Acid Ball

Eco-Earth was an eyesore in its previous life. An industrial relic from the pulp mill once operated by Boise Cascade, it was a big, black blob like something from an old sci-fi thriller. It became known to locals as the acid ball.

Buy Photo The acid ball has been a fixture of the riverfront since the 1960s. It once held liquid and chemical gases used to cook wood chips and make pulp for Boise Cascade. (Photo: Statesman Journal archives)

The stainless-steel tank, covered with an asphalt-like material, once held liquid and chemical gases used to cook wood chips and make pulp. The mill was shut down in 1982.

It has been a fixture of the riverfront since the early 1960s when it was floated up the Willamette River after being built in Portland's Albina Shipyards.

When the city of Salem acquired the property in the late 1980s, it requested the acid ball be left in place, hoping it could someday become a focal point, if the riverfront stretch of blackberry thickets, weeds and gravel were to ever become a park.

A new life as art

Once the park was developed, the community set out to transform the 25-foot-diameter ball into a piece of art.

Suggestions came pouring in, with most envisioning it as a globe or a fountain. Some thought it would make a perfect sun, a smiley face, a cherry, or a lawn bowling ball. One person suggested it be slathered in mud and seeds and transformed into a giant chia pet.

The Eco-Earth board of directors, chaired by former Salem Mayor Roger Gertenrich, settled on a sculpture of earth with translucent blue tiles and colorful continents. The privately funded project kicked off in June 1999.

It was a community project, much like Salem's Riverfront Carousel a few hundred yards to the north.

The Oregon National Guard volunteered to stabilize and reinforce the structure. Countless crafts people, professional artists and local high school students helped mold and paint embellishments. Hundreds of individuals, families, and businesses donated to sponsor countries, territories, states, oceans, and seas.

It took 18 months to map out the design and another 18 months to install the tile. Volunteers worked an estimated 30,000 hours on the project.

Story continues below:

SMITH / Statesman Journal)

In addition to the 86,000 ceramic tiles that make up the continents and oceans, Eco-Earth features 200 clay icons depicting wildlife, cultures, religions, historical events, technology or mythical creatures.

The finished piece, guarded by a black iron fence, was unveiled June 28, 2003. Ownership was handed off to the city, a gift estimated at $1 million.

It was a beautiful addition to the landscape, a tribute to the riverfront's industrial past. But anchored at the far south end of the park, it was out of sight and out of mind.

Mr. Chairman, ladies and gentlemen, I need not pause to say how very delighted I am to be here tonight, and how very delighted I am to see you expressing your concern about the issues that will be discussed tonight by turning out in such large numbers. I also want to say that I consider it a great honor to share this program with Dr. Bennett, Dr. Commager, and Rabbi Heschel, some of the distinguished leaders and personalities of our nation. And of course it's always good to come back to Riverside Church. Over the last eight years, I have had the privilege of preaching here almost every year in that period, and it is always a rich and rewarding experience to come to this great church and this great pulpit.

I come to this magnificent house of worship tonight because my conscience leaves me no other choice. I join you in this meeting because I am in deepest agreement with the aims and work of the organization which has brought us together, Clergy and Laymen Concerned About Vietnam. The recent statements of your executive committee are the sentiments of my own heart, and I found myself in full accord when I read its opening lines: ""A time comes when silence is betrayal."" That time has come for us in relation to Vietnam.

The truth of these words is beyond doubt, but the mission to which they call us is a most difficult one. Even when pressed by the demands of inner truth, men do not easily assume the task of opposing their government's policy, especially in time of war. Nor does the human spirit move without great difficulty against all the apathy of conformist thought within one's own bosom and in the surrounding world. Moreover, when the issues at hand seem as perplexing as they often do in the case of this dreadful conflict, we are always on the verge of being mesmerized by uncertainty. But we must move on.

Some of us who have already begun to break the silence of the night have found that the calling to speak is often a vocation of agony, but we must speak. We must speak with all the humility that is appropriate to our limited vision, but we must speak. And we must rejoice as well, for surely this is the first time in our nation's history that a significant number of its religious leaders have chosen to move beyond the prophesying of smooth patriotism to the high grounds of a firm dissent based upon the mandates of conscience and the reading of history. Perhaps a new spirit is rising among us. If it is, let us trace its movement, and pray that our own inner being may be sensitive to its guidance. For we are deeply in need of a new way beyond the darkness that seems so close around us.

Over the past two years, as I have moved to break the betrayal of my own silences and to speak from the burnings of my own heart, as I have called for radical departures from the destruction of Vietnam, many persons have questioned me about the wisdom of my path. At the heart of their concerns, this query has often loomed large and loud: ""Why are you speaking about the war, Dr. King? Why are you joining the voices of dissent?"" ""Peace and civil rights don't mix,"" they say. ""Aren't you hurting the cause of your people?"" they ask. And when I hear them, though I often understand the source of their concern, I am nevertheless greatly saddened, for such questions mean that the inquirers have not really known me, my commitment, or my calling. Indeed, their questions suggest that they do not know the world in which they live. In the light of such tragic misunderstanding, I deem it of signal importance to try to state clearly, and I trust concisely, why I believe that the path from Dexter Avenue Baptist Church -- the church in Montgomery, Alabama, where I began my pastorate -- leads clearly to this sanctuary tonight.

I come to this platform tonight to make a passionate plea to my beloved nation. This speech is not addressed to Hanoi or to the National Liberation Front. It is not addressed to China or to Russia. Nor is it an attempt to overlook the ambiguity of the total situation and the need for a collective solution to the tragedy of Vietnam. Neither is it an attempt to make North Vietnam or the National Liberation Front paragons of virtue, nor to overlook the role they must play in the successful resolution of the problem. While they both may have justifiable reasons to be suspicious of the good faith of the United States, life and history give eloquent testimony to the fact that conflicts are never resolved without trustful give and take on both sides. Tonight, however, I wish not to speak with Hanoi and the National Liberation Front, but rather to my fellow Americans.

Since I am a preacher by calling, I suppose it is not surprising that I have seven major reasons for bringing Vietnam into the",0.0,0.8125480856550367,-1.1,0.0

256685,False,1024,"Tony Dungy wasn't just a pioneer for minorities who aspire to be NFL head coaches. He was a beacon for mild- mannered, intellectual assistants who believe they can lead teams without playing the profanity-laced macho card.

If Seattle continues down the 9-1 path it has established this season, Seahawks offensive coordinator Darrell Bevell could become the latest example of a successful, soft-spoken assistant being elevated to the head coaching ranks for the first time.

""I don't think you necessarily have to be stern to be a head coach,"" Seahawks quarterback Russell Wilson said. ""Look at [Seahawks] Coach [Pete] Carroll. He's a guy who is very relaxed, very poised, very into being positive and bringing that positive synergy and that competitive nature.

""That's what I love about Coach Carroll. I think Coach Bevell is very, very similar in that fashion. You think about other greats, like Tony Dungy, in that fashion as well.""

Dungy, who helped turn around the Buccaneers and won a Super Bowl with the Colts, became a first-time head coach at 40. Bevell, 43, became an NFL assistant with the Packers in 2000. He got his first coordinator's job with the Vikings in 2006 and moved on to the same job with Seattle in 2011 after the Vikings removed the interim tag on head coach Leslie Frazier.

""He's going to be a head coach,"" Carroll said. ""I'll be excited for him when he gets that opportunity, and I'll do everything I can to help him get it. If that time ever comes, we'll really miss him because he's done a fantastic job for us. He's totally taken over the [play-]calling and the design of our [offense].""

Seattle's offense ranked 28th in Bevell's first season but shot up to ninth in 2012 when the Seahawks, with Bevell's urging, drafted Wilson, a quarterback from Bevell's alma mater, Wisconsin. This year, Seattle ranks 11th in total offense and second in rushing, behind Marshawn Lynch and the selective running of Wilson.

In NFL circles, Bevell is credited with constructing an offense that utilizes Wilson's running ability while not putting him at risk. He's also managed to develop this year's offense despite numerous injuries.

The starting offensive line has played only one game together. Receiver Sidney Rice is out for the year. Receiver Percy Harvin hasn't played a game yet, and tight end Zach Miller also has been hurt. Yet Wilson's passer rating (101.8) is better than the franchise-record 100.0 that he set as a rookie last season.

""When I was in Minnesota, it was my first opportunity to be a coordinator, so you kind of learn on the fly,"" Bevell said. ""I was learning the job, first of all. Then I was learning our people, our personnel. Then kind of how to use it.

""And I think that started to get me where I am today. I think I do a much better job of using our people and probably being little more flexible in what we do and what we don't let certain players do. So I've come a long way in that regard.""

Bevell, who signed a two-year extension this past offseason, almost certain will leave after this year. A year ago, he was in the running for the head coaching jobs in Arizona, Chicago and Jacksonville.

""I definitely don't want him to go anywhere,"" Wilson said. ""I love him to death. He's a guy who is so prepared all the time, very poised in situations. I care a lot about Coach Bevell and his family. But at the same time, I want the best for him, whatever it leads to.""

Packers quarterback Scott Tolzien completed 24 of 39 passes (61.5 percent) for 280 yards, a touchdown and two picks in his NFL debut in last week's loss to Philadelphia. The completions and passing yards set franchise records for a quarterback in his Packers debut. Not sure how big a deal that is considering the Packers had started only three quarterbacks in the previous 21 years before Tolzien stepped in for the injured Aaron Rodgers last week.

And so are NHL Buffalo Sabres owners Terry and Kim Pegula, a person close to the process confirmed Thursday night to The Associated Press while speaking on the condition of anonymity because the sale is supposed to be private.

Michael Cohen, Trump's executive vice president and special counsel, confirmed in an email to the AP that his boss was chosen to advance to the next round of bidding. Cohen said he was informed of the decision by Morgan Stanley, the banking firm overseeing the sale of the team for late owner Ralph Wilson's estate.

""Mr. Trump's significant wealth, name recognition and real estate knowledge makes him a viable option,"" Cohen said.

Trump is bidding on his own after electing against being joined by partners. He is prepared to make an all-cash offer.

Trump is proving to be serious in his efforts to buy the Bills, who are on the market after Wilson died in March. Trump was previously dismissed by critics as using the Bills' sale as a publicity stunt.

The Pegulas have been low-key throughout the sale process in regards to their interests in purchasing the Bills.

The Bills most recently were valued by Forbes at $870 million but are expected to sell for at least $1 billion, partly because NFL teams rarely go on the market.

Morgan Stanley's selection of Trump and the Pegulas comes after prospective groups were asked to submit non-binding bids by Tuesday.

A Toronto group that includes rocker Jon Bon Jovi was expected to submit a bid. It's not known if that group has been selected to advance.

The deadline Tuesday was regarded as a soft one, meaning other interested parties can still submit bids until a prospective owner is identified. The time, however, is growing shorter for outside groups to become involved.

The next step is for groups who have been approved to advance is to meet with both Morgan Stanley and members of the estate to obtain the franchise's financial information. Bills President Russ Brandon also is expected to make a presentation to prospective bidders.

Once that is done in the coming weeks, groups will then be asked to submit formal bids. The bidding process is unsealed, meaning Wilson's estate will have the ability to ask groups to increase their bids.

Though no timetable has been established by Morgan Stanley, a prospective owner is could be identified by as early as Labor Day and presented to NFL owners for approval during league meetings in early October.",0.787857144093587,0.787857144093587,0.0,0.0

The Honorable Jason Chaffetz

Chairman

Committee on Oversight and Government Reform

U.S. House of Representatives

Washington, DC 20515

Dear Mr. Chairman:

It has now been two weeks since Ranking Member Cummings wrote to you requesting that the Oversight Committee immediately begin reviewing President-elect Donald Trump's financial arrangements in order to identify and protect against conflicts of interest.

Although you have stated publicly that you will hold Mr. Trump to the same standards as President Obama and Secretary Clinton, you have not responded to Ranking Member Cummings' letter, and you have not taken steps to conduct basic oversight of these unprecedented challenges.

Since Ranking Member Cummings sent his letter, Americans across the country have flooded our Committee's offices with thousands of calls in strong support of this investigation, jamming our phone lines with more calls than we have ever received in response to any other issue.

At the same time, during this two-week period, troubling new revelations about Mr. Trump's actions ― as well as those of his family members and business associates ― have made the need for robust congressional oversight even more urgent.

For these reasons, we are now all writing to you in support of Ranking Member Cummings' request, and we ask that the Oversight Committee begin its work as soon as possible.

President-Elect Trump's Refusal to Acknowledge Bipartisan Concerns

Mr. Trump has exhibited a shocking level of disdain for legitimate bipartisan concerns about his conflicts of interest. For example, during an interview with The New York Times, Mr. Trump stated, ""The law's totally on my side, the president can't have a conflict of interest.""

Of course, this statement is incorrect. Mr. Trump can ― and already does ― have obvious conflicts of interest between his widespread global business interests and his Constitutional obligations as president.

The relevant question is whether he will follow the model set by his predecessors to mitigate these conflicts by liquidating his assets and placing them in a blind trust. If he refuses, then Congress must fulfill our own responsibilities by closely examining the Constitutional and statutory provisions that govern Mr. Trump's actions, determining whether his approach meets these standards, and proposing appropriate reforms to address any problems we identify.

Unfortunately, Mr. Trump does not appear to be taking these concerns seriously. On November 21, 2016, he tweeted, ""Prior to the election it was well known that I have interests in properties all over the world. Only the crooked media makes this a big deal!""

Again, this statement is clearly incorrect. The nation's leading Republican and Democratic ethics scholars have called on Mr. Trump to place his financial holdings in a blind trust.

For example, the top ethics counsels for former President George W. Bush, Richard Painter, and President Barack Obama, Norman Eisen, published an op-ed in The Washington Post titled, ""Trump's 'Blind Trust' is Neither Blind Nor Trustworthy."" They wrote:

Donald Trump must urgently rethink his plan to allow his children to run his businesses. As drastic as it may seem to him, he should instead put all his conflict-generating assets in a true blind trust run by an independent trustee. The good of his own administration, and that of the country, demand nothing less.

Mr. Painter and Ambassador Eisen recommend that Mr. Trump ""appoint an independent professional trustee to take charge of liquidating and converting to cash Trump business holdings through an initial public offering or leveraged buyout."" Second, they recommend that the proceeds ""be turned over to the trustee to be managed."" Third, they recommend that as long as Mr. Trump's children and their spouses are dealing with Mr. Trump's business matters, ""he should ask them to step away from the transition team and the White House, and to not advise him or be involved in any U.S. government affairs.""

Similarly, a group of 19 government accountability experts and organizations called on Mr. Trump to place his assets into a blind trust. They wrote:

Contacts about the Trump businesses should be prohibited between all other administration officials and people involved in the businesses, including any of the children who maintain an ongoing involvement with the businesses. Except for personal communication with the president or first lady, such telephone calls and emails should be routed to the White House counsel to make sure that the firewall is not breached.

Even The Wall Street Journal's editorial board argued that ""Mr. Trump's best option is to liquidate his stake in the company."" In addition, the editorial board of The Salt Lake Tribune agreed with Ranking Member Cummings' request to conduct a rigorous review, writing: ""that, if he wants anyone to take him seriously, is exactly what Chaffetz and his Oversight Committee should start preparing to do.""

Because the system voltage for this board is lower than other Arduino development boards, it may not be compatible with many Arduino shields which were designed to run at 5V. The Arduino Pro 3.3V still works great with our prototyping shield so you can create your own 3.3V shields. The lower system voltage also has its advantages, like ease of use with many common 3.3V sensors.

Arduino Pro does not come with connectors populated so that you can solder in any connector or wire with any orientation you need. We recommend first time Arduino users start with the Uno R3. It's a great board that will get you up and running quickly. The Arduino Pro series is meant for users that understand the limitations of system voltage (3.3V), lack of connectors, and USB off board.

To keep things affordable and low profile, we've chosen to make the DC power jack footprint available, but not to populate it. We recommend running the board with a LiPo battery for better portability. Also, to keep the cost low, we made changes like using all SMD components and switching to a two layer PCB.

This board connects directly to the FTDI Basic Breakout board and supports auto-reset. The Arduino Pro also works with the FTDI cable but the FTDI cable does not bring out the DTR pin so the auto-reset feature will not work. In this latest version of the Arduino Pro we've also moved the FTDI headers back just a skoach so that the pins don't hang over the edge of the board. We've also populated it with a sturdier power selection switch.

255123,True,704,"WASHINGTON ― The Jones Act waiver for Puerto Rico expired Sunday night, and ""it is not being extended at this time,"" Department of Homeland Security spokesman David Lapan told HuffPost on Monday.

DHS had temporarily waived the Jones Act ― an arguably outdated law that imposes exorbitant shipping costs on the U.S. island ― on Sept. 28. The waiver had meant that Puerto Rico had the option of importing food, fuel and supplies more quickly, and for half the cost, in the aftermath of Hurricane Maria.

With the 1920 law back in effect, the island is now required to pay much higher costs to import supplies. The Jones Act requires that all goods shipped between U.S. ports be carried by U.S.-owned and operated ships, which are more expensive vessels than others in the global marketplace. That's meant that Puerto Rico pays double the costs to import goods from the U.S. mainland compared with neighboring islands ― and that U.S. vessels are making bank.

The return to higher shipping costs won't help Puerto Rico as it tries to climb out of economic devastation. Nearly half of the 3.4 million Americans on the island still don't have drinking water since Maria hit nearly three weeks ago. Just 15 percent have electricity. Many people still haven't heard from loved ones, and at least 39 deaths have been attributed to the storm.

Lapan said DHS is ""always prepared to review requests on a case-by-case basis and respond quickly"" to possible waivers of the Jones Act. But those decisions have to be related to national defense, he said, and are not driven by cost-related matters.

""We believe that extending the waiver is unnecessary to support the humanitarian relief efforts on the island,"" Lapan said. ""There is an ample supply of Jones Act-qualified vessels to ensure that cargo is able to reach Puerto Rico.""

Despite DHS' position, Puerto Rico Gov. Ricardo Rossello said Monday night that he wants another extension of the Jones Act waiver.

""I think we should have it,"" Rossello told CBS News' David Begnaud. ""In this emergency phase, while we're looking to sustain and save lives, we should have all of the assets at hand.""

President Donald Trump, who is spending Monday golfing, had originally hedged on waiving the Jones Act for Puerto Rico at all, saying ""a lot of shippers"" didn't want him to do it. He eventually caved to pressure from lawmakers including Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.).

McCain has been pushing to get rid of the Jones Act altogether. It costs Puerto Rico hundreds of millions of dollars every year, and he recently introduced legislation to nix the law.

""Now that the temporary Jones Act waiver for Puerto Rico has expired, it is more important than ever for Congress to pass my bill to permanently exempt Puerto Rico from this archaic and burdensome law,"" McCain said in a statement to HuffPost. ""Until we provide Puerto Rico with long-term relief, the Jones Act will continue to hinder much-needed efforts to help the people of Puerto Rico recover and rebuild from Hurricane Maria.""",0.771347213141822,0.771347213141822,0.0,0.0
256521,True,792,"You've successfully decluttered your living space. There's no junk, cruft, kipple, or unloved things to be seen. It was a lot of physical work with several emotional moments, and perhaps a tussle with your partner or housemates. But wow, do you feel good. Lighter. Free from the weight of your possessions. Ready to do anything.

And now what? Where do you go from here? I've been through three different but interconnecting phases after decluttering. Let me share my insights.

Maintenance

In order to keep your space looking great, you'll need to keep up the decluttering vibe. You'll set some rules for yourself and carefully follow them. Whether you follow a 10 minute-a-day decluttering schedule or a one-in-one-out policy, you've got to maintain your lovely habitat.

But when your focus relaxes from its razor-sharp incisions into your belongings and there's not so much to declutter anymore, it's easy to let the maintenance phase drift away as you put your attention on other things. That's when you'll hit the next phase.

Recluttering

It may start with a practical and fully reasonable excuse: you decluttered something you needed after all, so now you have to repurchase the (insert item here). In my case, it was an old fashioned, crank-handle food mill. I owned it for 12 years and used it once a year. I figured it was safe to declutter but nothing substitutes for it. Now I have a new food mill that I will use once a year.

From those practical repurchases, it is a slippery slope to buying other things, and to taking freebies and promotional items. Your one-in-one-out system slides a bit, then fully collapses. Before you know it your ""hot spot"" is strewn with stuff and you're on the way to a new collection of all those doodads that you eliminated a few months back.

The recluttering phase can last a long time. Consumer culture is the norm for many of us and it doesn't seem out of place to go to the mall for fun and to buy stuff impulsively. But if you enjoyed positive effects from being decluttered, eventually you'll realise what is happening and you'll start decluttering again.

Anti-consumerism

When you catch yourself in the act of mindless recluttering, you will probably start decluttering again. At the same time you may experience a strong backlash of anti-consumerism. ""How dare those big corporations do this to me? Why is my life all based on owning things? I refuse to be manipulated by their marketing!""

This is a step beyond decluttering and it can be a potent lifestyle change.

Anti-consumerism twists around how you interact with stuff. Shopping may disgust you. Being in malls or mega-stores will be difficult. Seeing people buying things to feed their egos will cause you grief. You're going to have a period of seriously negative judgement about people. It will pass but it is powerful. Be careful to express it gently, if you express it at all.

You'll stop shopping for recreation and spend your time and money differently. Your priorities will change and experiences will trump objects. You'll buy stuff only when you can't find a reasonable substitute among your inventory. When you do purchase, you'll do it with a new perspective – how can it be reused and how will you eventually get rid of it? You'll get creative and crafty with repurposing things.

In fact, you may even go as far as regretting your decluttering. All that stuff you got rid of, what a waste. You could have used those extra tea towels to make potholders.",0.5948742091972777,0.7948742091972777,-0.1,-0.1

Jarome Iginla, the 36-year-old elder statesman of the Boston Bruins' strike force, made like a father returning home from a protracted absence late in Sunday night's first period. His linemates and teammates acted accordingly to halt a slump before it could gain substantial traction.

With his club facing a 1-0 deficit, Iginla cut directly to the porch of the host New York Rangers' net. There, he got back to filling the twine with biscuits by ushering center David Krejci's pass behind goaltender Henrik Lundqvist.

The connection drew a 1-1 knot with 1:53 to spare in a first period that should have yielded a multigoal advantage for the Blueshirts. The hosts had run up a 20-9 advantage in the shooting gallery by the first intermission.

Another 41 minutes and 53 seconds passed before Boston stamped a 6-3 victory with contributions from 10 different point-getters. One might say they won the game two periods to one and that Iginla and company took charge to enact the long-awaited U-turn.

Iginla, Krejci and Milan Lucic (who also characteristically led the team with five hits) joined three other Bruins in Sunday's multipoint club with two apiece. The top troika was on the ice for the 1-1 equalizer, the 2-1 go-ahead strike and the final dose of insurance with 1:36 left in regulation.

They also established an uninterrupted flow on Rangers property in the ninth minute of the middle frame. With no whistles in between, they gave way to Loui Eriksson and Carl Soderberg, who collaborated to augment the lead to 3-1 at the 9:34 mark.

No points or plus/minus credit for them to gain on that last play. Just a testament to how they can and should incite the other lines to give the Bruins the most out of a deep, relatively balanced strike force.

Brian Babineau/Getty Images

Those recorded and unquantifiable contributions produced a copious supply of ice shavings to pile on top of a preceding dry spell. Then again, the Olympic break in the team's schedule may have magnified the look of that hex. (Iginla's goal drought was only two games entering Sunday, but it had been 22 days since he last beat an NHL netminder.)

Come what may, Boston claimed one out of four potential points to commence the homestretch coming out of the Olympics. Krejci and his wingers personified that sluggish start with minus-four ratings apiece and a few power-play points functioning as little more than napkins covering an abrasion.

Sunday night's mid-game turnaround marked a much more effective compression and closure of the wound. The convincing victory neutralized the vinegar from an iffy opening frame and demonstrated everything the Bruins will need from their go-to scoring line in the defining phases of the NHL season.

While they need not expect a score of duplicate performances, the Iginla-Krejci-Lucic unit should make Sunday's perk-up a turning point into the homestretch of the 2013-14 season. If they replace those ice chips faster than they melt, then the first two post-Olympic outings will shrivel in significance.

In the wake of both last Wednesday's 5-4 overtime loss at Buffalo and Saturday's 4-2 home falter versus Washington, the group garnered attention for being conspicuous by its absence.

After the blunder in Buffalo, Joe Haggerty of csnne.com wrote that the starting strikers ""…didn't create anything offensively during five-on-five play"" and that ""It certainly looked like there was rust with that line and plenty of inconsistency to go around as with the rest of the Bruins roster.""

Three days later, the New England Hockey Journal's Jesse Connolly opined in his Bruins-Caps recap, ""Pretty invisible night for the top line of David Krejci, Jarome Iginla and Milan Lucic. They, like many of their fellow B's, missed the net far too often when they had a chance to put pucks on Holtby.""

Conversely, Sunday's game produced a reminder of how these three forwards have come to constitute Boston's top three scorers. Productivity from Gregory Campbell and Eriksson, to name two, confirmed that other Bruins can and will buckle down when the first line does.

When results like Sunday's surface, the Bruins verify that they are following their topmost template for achievement in 2013-14. With Iginla, they have a Stanley Cup-starved veteran of 16-plus seasons with plenty to offer in the way of sheer output and infectious hunger to spread amongst the dressing room.

A study involving eight people who lost consciousness immediately after being shocked by a TASER X26 – the most common electronic control device (ECD) used by police, corrections agencies and the military – concluded that ECD shocks can induce fatal cardiac arrest by causing cardiac ""capture"" and ventricular tachycardia/ventricular fibrillation (VT/VF). Seven of the eight persons profiled in the study died while the eighth suffered memory impairment after receiving a near-fatal shock, according to an article published in Circulation, the journal of the American Heart Association.


The eight subjects of the peer-reviewed study were all male, ranging from 16 to 44 years old. Six were under the age of 25. All were struck in the chest with barbs from a TASER X26, a handgun-shaped weapon that fires the barbs with attached conductive wires using compressed nitrogen. The device delivers an initial 5,000-volt shock, followed by rapid micro-pulsing that is designed to mimic the electrical signals used by the brain to communicate with the muscles. The standard shock cycle lasts five seconds but can be shortened or repeated by the user.


The study found that a TASER shock ""can cause cardiac electric capture and provoke cardiac arrest"" resulting from an abnormal, rapid heart rate and uncontrolled, fluttering heart contractions. The journal article on the study's findings was authored by Dr. Douglas Zipes, with the Krannert Institute of Cardiology at Indiana University.


Scottsdale, Arizona-based TASER International, Inc., which manufactures the ECD devices, strongly defended its products. Company spokesman Steve Tuttle noted that with only eight subjects in the study, ""broader conclusions shouldn't be drawn based on such a limited sample.""


""There have been 3 million uses of TASER devices worldwide, with this case series reporting eight of concern,"" he added. ""This article does not support a cause-effect association and fails to accurately evaluate the risks versus the benefits of the thousands of lives saved by police with TASER devices.""


The company's website boasts that TASERs have saved nearly 125,000 lives, and that ""Every Day TASER CEWs [Conducted Electrical Weapons] are Used 904 Times, Saving a Life from Potential Death or Serious Injury Every 30 Minutes."" The site also quotes a Wake Forest University study which found that ""in 1,201 cases, 99.75% [of] people subjected to a TASER CEW had no significant injuries.""


Research published by USA Today in May 2012 indicated that the use of TASERs by police has saved lives because officers are less likely to kill someone using a TASER than by shooting them. The research also found that TASERs reduced the number of injuries suffered by police officers when apprehending suspects.


Tuttle questioned whether Dr. Zipes might have possible bias because he had testified as an expert witness in lawsuits against TASER. ""There are key facts that contradict the role of the TASER device in all of these cited cases, and Dr. Zipes has conveniently omitted all facts that contradict his opinion,"" Tuttle said.


However, Amnesty International reported in February 2012 that more than 500 post-ECD-shock deaths occurred following TASER deployments between 2001 and 2008. Further, a report from a commission of inquiry into the death of a man at the Vancouver airport in Canada concluded there was evidence ""that the electric current from a conducted energy weapon is capable of triggering ventricular capture ... and that the risk of ventricular fibrillation increases as the tips of the probes get closer to the walls of the heart.""


Other studies, including a 2011 report by the ACLU of Arizona, have also identified problems with the use of TASERs by law enforcement agencies. [See: PLN, April 2012, p.26]. Prior to Dr. Zipes' research, though, no peer-reviewed study had concluded that ECD shocks can induce ventricular fibrillation leading to sudden cardiac arrest and death.


TASER published an eight-page warning in March 2013 that stated, ""exposure in the chest area near the heart has a low probability of inducing extra heart beats (cardiac capture). In rare circumstances, cardiac capture could lead to cardiac arrest. When possible, avoid targeting the frontal chest area near the heart to reduce the risk of potential serious injury or death.""


In November 2013, TASER submitted a statement to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) indicating that the company would pay a total of $2.3 million in settlements in product liability lawsuits. The statement said the settlements were intended to end legal battles over TASER-related ""suspect injury or death.""


TASER also changed the warning labels on its ECD products. The company used to tout TASERs as",0.6908048720921046,0.7908048720921046,-0.1,0.0

255058,False,1024,"Since Afreeca Freecs' top laner Jang ""MaRin"" Gyeong-hwan pulled out the splitpushing AD Kennen during the very early stages of Season 7, Kennen has been all the rage internationally as a viable splitpusher and aggressive presence in the top lane that had difficulty dying to tanks. This is still true, as Kennen can very easily scale thanks to the lack of kill pressure that tanks generally have.

With the new midseason patch and attempt to shift kill pressure away from tanks once more, Kennen has continued to be a staple pick in the top lane against top lane champions just hoping to get out of the lane phase without a huge disadvantage. Kennen is a great bully and an even better scaling champion, letting his splitpush plan come to fruition and carry the game alone, if given enough room.

Runes

1 Attack Speed and 8 Attack Damage Reds, Armor Yellows, 3 Attack Speed and 6 Magic Resistance Blues, Attack Speed Quintessences

This rune page gives you a good balance of resistances, attack damage, and attack speed. Because of Kennen's W passive, he's more inclined to specialize in attack speed earlier, and more attack speed increases his sustain through Doran's Blade as well as his initial Blade of the Ruined King buy, making his dueling much better in the early and mid game stages.

Masteries

Eighteen in Ferocity is pretty standard for auto attacking threats. Kennen has great synergy with Fervor of battle in particular, as the attack damage contributes to his W passive, which will give him greater burst damage as he builds up the empowered auto attack. Fresh Blood and Battle Trance help with laning without a downside, and Kennen needs the armor penetration over the magic penetration for his Blade of the Ruined King damage onto tanks despite his tendency to do slightly more magic damage (thanks to creeps having low magic resistance) over the course of the game.

Twelve in Resolve keeps Kennen alive and allows him to threaten the splitpush much more often thanks to the use of Insight. Insight should be taken over Fearless because Kennen already gets a good chunk of resistances in fights through his E, making more resistance suboptimal versus having health to balance it out. As well, having Flash and Teleport up more often allows Kennen to make cross-map plays and use the utility of flash to escape sticky splitpush or teamfight situations. Veteran Scars and Tough Skin help optimize his early resistances and contributes to a brutal laning phase for the opponent as trading becomes more and more fruitless.

Skill Order

First six levels: QEWWWR

Getting Q first is the best harass tool, and E afterwards helps escape any early cheese from the top laner or jungler. After, however, W is the skill you want to max. It helps with waveclear in conjunction with E, and actually scales with your total attack damage, increasing by level. This is AD Kennen's primary tool for dueling as it provides huge burst in lane in combination with an active W.

After that, maxing E second helps with waveclear and gives you access to your escape much more often, making your splitpush a lot safer. Your ultimate should be leveled when possible, and your Q should be leveled last despite its early point as a harass tool.

Build Order

Though Doran's Shield got a huge buff, it's still not a great choice for champions hoping to bully their lane as Kennen would. Rushing Blade of the Ruined King is a must, even though it got its cost very very slightly increased. After that, going Frozen Mallet will ensure that you will have the survivability and kiting ability to deal with any tank or fighter hoping to contest your presence in a side lane. Phantom Dancer adds to your attack speed and continues to help your survivability for a very low cost. Death's Dance got an insane buff in Patch 7.9 that helps Kennen's dueling substantially, and contributes to his W passive more than any other AD item given it having 80 attack damage. Guardian Angel helps as well, as it also now gives attack damage.

Doran's Blade + Health Potion Blade of the Ruined King Mercury Treads Frozen Mallet Phantom Dancer Death's Dance Guardian Angel Maw of Malmortius or Runaan's Hurricane

Playstyle

Early game, Kennen's ranged advantage lends itself well to a favorable laning phase because he can easily harass and cs simultaneously. That combined with his good base damage on abilities allows him to trade against the patterns of most meta top laners. Kennen is fairly gankable, so make sure you're not pushing in. If you are, your ultimate is a good get out of jail free card as it will stun pursuers as you scurry away. Early game is not when the splitpushing starts, after all.",0.5417956723831594,0.5417956723831594,0.0,0.0

Canadian home sales in November recorded their biggest decline since 2012, suggesting recent efforts by the federal government to cool the nation's housing market is having an impact.

Sales fell 5.3 percent in November, the Canadian Real Estate Association said in a statement. That's the largest monthly decline since August 2012, the Ottawa-based agency said. Prices though continued marching higher despite the lower sales.

Finance Minister Bill Morneau in October tightened qualification requirements for mortgage insurance, specifically to cool the Toronto market. The impact is being felt nation wide, the agency said today.

""The government's newly tightened mortgage regulations have dampened a wide swath of housing markets, including places not targeted directly by the government's latest regulatory measures,"" Cliff Iverson, the association's president, said in the statement.

The decline in activity was driven by a sharp fall in British Columbia, falling 3.4 percent in Vancouver. Sales in Toronto were down 2.4 percent.

Still, the average sales price of a home sold in Canada last month was up 2.3, including gains in Vancouver and Toronto.",0.6983475831548709,0.6983475831548709,0.0,0.0
256892,False,1024,"""The council is using a day that should unite Australians to divide Australians,"" he said on Wednesday morning. ""I recognise Australia Day, and its history, is complex for many Indigenous Australians but the overwhelming majority of Australians believe the 26th of January is the day and should remain our national day. ""The citizenship ceremonies around Australia are all about inclusion. We begin with a welcome to country and an acknowledgment of country, and we celebrate our multicultural nation; we celebrate the oldest continuous human culture on earth, of our First Australians, just as we celebrate the youngest baby in the newest citizen's arms."" Melbourne lord mayor Robert Doyle said the City of Melbourne would ""absolutely not"" be following in Yarra Council's footsteps. He said the ""privilege"" of holding a citizenship ceremony on January 26 was not something he would give up lightly.

""I think that is a divisive debate, it is also a settled question. What other councils do is a question for them,"" he said. ""We always have the most senior Wurundjeri elder Aunty Joy who does provide a Welcome to country in the most generous spirited way on Australia Day each year,"" he said. It is understood Yarra Council could be stripped of its authorisation to conduct citizenship ceremonies as early as Thursday. Despite pressure from the federal government against such a move, Yarra councillors voted unanimously. All clauses passed unamended despite some fiery submissions from a few people in the audience who said the council hadn't surveyed the community widely enough.

Yarra Council voted to: Refer to Australia Day as ""January 26"" until another ""more appropriate"" term is adopted nationally;

Stop holding citizenship ceremonies on January 26;

Hold a ""small-scale, culturally-sensitive event featuring a smoking ceremony that acknowledges the loss of culture, language and identity felt by Aboriginal community on January 26"";

Adopt a ""communications plan that focuses on broader community education to help people better understand Aboriginal community experiences of January 26"";

Officially support the #changethedate campaign in council publications and on social media;

Consider ways to lobby the federal government to change the date of Australia Day. Cr Stephen Jolly said the council would not stop anyone from celebrating January 26 as Australia Day. ""It's not North Korea here, you know. We are a small council. If the City of Yarra decides to call it January 26... that does not stop the vast majority of people in the council area calling it Australia Day. No one is going to jail because they are having an Australia Day barbecue."" Premier Daniel Andrews and Federal Assistant Minister for Immigration Alex Hawke also attacked the decision, with Mr Hawke warning ""Greens-dominated councils"" could be banned from hosting citizenship ceremonies.

Assistant Minister for Immigration Alex Hawke sent a letter to councils across the country on Tuesday warning that if they stopped complying with the Australian Citizenship Ceremonies Code they would lose their hosting rights. ""The government views the recent public actions of Greens-dominated councils, using their ability to host Australian citizenship ceremonies to lobby against Australia Day on January 26 as a breach of the Code,"" he said in a statement. ""As long as Australia Day is celebrated on 26 January, this is a most appropriate date for a citizenship ceremony to take place. ""Local councils are now on notice that if they politicise Australian citizenship, the government will see it as a breach of the code and take the appropriate action."" Earlier, Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews said the move from the council was unnecessary.


""You can celebrate what modern Australia is and citizenship ceremonies are a big part of that — it's truly a magical thing,"" he told the ABC.


""I don't think anybody should be trying to diminish that.""


""I think we get the balance right [on Australia Day]. We respect the traditional owners of our land, but we then get on in a really unified way.""

Mayor Amanda Stone said she can't find any requirement in the code for councils to hold citizenship ceremonies on Australia Day. ""The code actually says you shouldn't use a ceremony to promote a political agenda or a religious agenda or commercial agenda,"" she said. ""We wouldn't be intending to do that."" The council commissioned an independent survey of nearly 300 non-Indigenous people, which showed strong support for change. ""In the last 12 months there has been a groundswell of community support for change from both Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal people across the country. The community is looking for leadership on this issue,"" Cr Stone said.

""People can still have their barbecue and parties on the January 26 public holiday, but I hope our stance encourages people to stop and think about what this date really means in the history of our nation."" Yarra City usually holds citizenship ceremonies every two months and Cr Stone said they would continue to do so. Ms Stone said councillors took into consideration the ministers' warning before Tuesday night's vote, but all decided a bold move for change was required. Yarra City",0.0,0.754658109931798,-0.9,-0.1

Czech-born Mills, 31, has been found guilty of racially aggravated public disorder after a rant at her New Zealand-born neighbour in Macclesfield, south of Manchester.


Chelsea O'Reilly, who has dual British and New Zealand citizenship, said: ""She called me a stupid fat Australian b****. Because of my accent there can be some confusion over my nationality. She knew I was from New Zealand.


""She was trying to be offensive. I was really insulted. She said she would kill my dog. Bizarrely she then blew raspberries at me like a child.""


The incident happened when O'Reilly was giving a statement to police about a domestic incident between Mills and Mills' husband in early September, the Daily Mail reported.


Mills, who had called the police after running from her house, had stormed over to O'Reilly's house and began screaming at her.


Two police constables told the court they had heard Mills use the word ""Australian"" during her drunken rant.


At Macclesfield magistrates' court Mills agreed she had shouted but denied she was being racist.


""I did not use the word 'Australian'. I used to live with an Australian person. She was very nice.""

But chairman of the bench Brian Donohue said: ""You were in an emotional and inebriated state. The word 'Australian' was used. It was racially aggravated and the main reason it was used was in hostility.""

Mills denied the charge of racially aggravated public disorder but was found guilty and fined £110. She admitted assaulting a police constable by kicking him in the shin and knee and was fined £200 on that charge. She was also ordered to pay both victims £50 compensation, and £500 court costs.

258729,False,1024,"Advertisement Editor's Picks The STEM Crisis Is a Myth

Figuring out how to get more students drawn into the ""STEM education pipeline"" has been a major concern of those arguing that there exists an acute shortage of STEM workers, be it in the U.S., the U.K., Brazil, Australia, or almost any country you choose. Typically, the arguments made to encourage students to enter the STEM pipeline center around how interesting STEM careers are and especially how much money you can earn over pursuing non-STEM careers.

However, others point out that many students aren't interested in STEM careers because they see that the academic work needed at both the high school and university-level to pursue a STEM degree is just too hard in comparison to non-STEM degrees. Until this changes (for example, by increasing the readiness of a prospective STEM student by ""redshirting"" them), the argument goes, don't expect a full STEM pipeline anytime soon.

Another factor little talked about that I personally witnessed has been the changing social compact between STEM workers and employers over the past several decades and the impact it has had on convincing students today to pursue a STEM career. When my father, an electro-optical engineer was laid off from his company late in the recession of 1957-1958, he assumed the company would be rehiring him a few months later when the economy got better. His wasn't an unreasonable assumption, since that was the general practice in the 1950s. When he wasn't soon rehired, and with a new house mortgage to pay and three children under age 5 to feed, my father left his temporary job of selling Electrolux vacuums door-to-door and found another electro-optical engineering job. He stayed with that company for another 25 years when he retired with the usual gold desk pen-set, which now sits on my desk.

When I graduated with my undergraduate computer systems engineering degree in 1977 after a stint in the military, my expectation of a generally comfortable career working for at most a handful of companies was similar to my father's. I remember when my friends and I were looking for jobs, our discussions often centered on whether a company we were planning to interview with was one worth spending a career with. IBM, for example, had a commitment to a life time job for its employees while Digital Equipment Corporation had a no lay-off policy. Other companies were offering similar types of inducements as a reason to work for them. Even so, part of our employment equation now included the possibility of layoffs, given that between 1968 and 1970, aerospace employment (which had been up to that point was promoted as the most exciting industry to be a part of) had dropped from 1 418 000 to 1 177 000 workers as the Vietnam War wound down and the Apollo space program's end was coming into view.

A New York Times article of the time titled, ""Aerospace: Tale of a Sick Industry,"" reported that while mass layoffs in the aerospace industry was not uncommon, ""what is unfamiliar and more painful about the current recession is that so many laid off are scientists and engineers whose skills the nation can ill afford to lose permanently."" A related Times article reported that among those aerospace employees laid off were the majority of the remaining members of NASA's von Braun group, the ""nucleus of the engineering team that launched the first American satellite and built the Saturn 5 moon rocket."" The fact that famous rocket engineers could get laid off signaled to us the need to be a bit more cautious in who we decided to go to work for.

While the engineering job market was improving by the time I graduated, the engineering unemployment crisis of a few years earlier had definitely discouraged many students from getting into engineering. It even motivated many to look towards seeking careers in business, a career field decidedly shunned during the 1960s. Business was in fact the most popular field of study for entering college students in 1972 according to the American Council on Education; many laid-off engineers also decided to pursue MBAs or other business degrees since the opportunities in non-tech fields looked brighter.

But mostly throughout the late 1970s and into the mid-to-late 1980s, engineers (and the ever-growing number of IT professionals) identified themselves with their company, and as a member of the upper middle class. Compensation for fully employed electrical engineers, believe it not, was higher than that of the average salaried doctor. The 1979-82 period with recession and high inflation (inflation hit 14.76 percent in 1980) was no fun, but for the most part engineers thought the company they were working for—and were loyal to—would mostly likely be the one they retired with, or if not, then surely the next one. Companies still offered decent pensions (which also helped keep job hopping, which has highly discouraged, down) as well as good educational benefits to keep you current; but you put in a lot of hours in return.

257385,False,1024,"Joseph Pujol, a man of singular talent, was born in Marseilles, France in 1857. In his early youth it became clear that he was a natural entertainer, singing, dancing, and performing for his parents' house guests. He had a love for music, and over the years he became handy with a trombone, but it was a different wind instrument that led to his eventual fame and fortune.

Young Joseph became alarmed one day when he was swimming in the sea, and took a deep breath before submerging. As he inhaled, he felt icy cold water entering through his rear end. He immediately returned to shore, and was astonished to see a great deal of seawater pouring from his backside. A doctor assured him that this was nothing to be concerned about, and it seems that Joseph took this advice to heart, exploring his strange new ability with a healthy curiosity.

He soon found that with a little abdominal control, he could deliberately suck water in through his anus, and project it back out with impressive force, creating a spout of several meters. Further experimentation led him to discover that he could also suck in large amounts of air if he contorted himself properly, which he could let out at will. He was also able to use varying pressures to produce distinct notes, allowing him to reproduce simple tunes. Needless to say, he became very popular at school as a result. But little did he know that this unique talent would one day make him the most well-known and most highly paid entertainer in all of France.

→

While Joseph was in the army he amused his fellow soldiers with his lowbrow tricks, and they gave him the nickname ""Le Pétomane,"" which translates roughly to ""fartiste."" When he left the service he opened a bakery in Marseilles which was reputed to bake some of the finest bran muffins in the south of France, but he started a foray into show business when he began to feel restless. At first he resisted using his unique physiology in his stage comedy act, instead trying the ""yokel with the trombone"" routine, but the fartiste within him could not be contained.

The Moulin Rouge ca. 1923

In 1887 at age 30, ""Le Pétomane"" first took the stage in Marseilles. The initial attempt was met with some skepticism, since ""petomanie"" (or ""fartistry"") was something of a novelty for the French. But he quickly won the audience over, and was a big success. He developed his act locally for about five years, then went on to Paris to try for the infamous Moulin Rouge. He succeeded.

""Ladies and gentlemen, I have the honor to present a session of Petomanie."" Such was his introduction at the famous vanity theater on his first night. He was very finely dressed in a red coat and black satin breeches, with a pair of white gloves held in his hands. He looked quite sophisticated as he explained to the audience that the emissions he was about to produce were completely odorless, since he irrigated his colon daily. The audience was completely unprepared for what lay ahead. And so he began.

He started off with a series of fart impressions… a new bride's timid toot; her noisy, flapping emissions a week later; the solid, booming fart of a miller; and a majestic ten-second-long helping of flatulence to wrap up his introduction. He did impressions of famous people, he played songs, and he blew out candles. He did imitations of cannon fire, and reenacted a thunderstorm. And that was just the first portion of the show.

257361,True,605,"Today was supposed to be the day that Verizon's new 4G ""network optimization"" policy went into effect. Verizon's heaviest data users on grandfathered unlimited plans faced the possibility of having their speeds throttled down to make room on the LTE network for customers who pay for data by the gigabyte. But Wednesday afternoon, Verizon said it would pull the plug on the new policy before it went into effect.

Here's Verizon's statement:

Advertisement

Verizon is committed to providing its customers with an unparalleled mobile network experience. At a time of ever-increasing mobile broadband data usage, we not only take pride in the way we manage our network resources, but also take seriously our responsibility to deliver exceptional mobile service to every customer. We've greatly valued the ongoing dialogue over the past several months concerning network optimization and we've decided not to move forward with the planned implementation of network optimization for 4G LTE customers on unlimited plans. Exceptional network service will always be our priority and we remain committed to working closely with industry stakeholders to manage broadband issues so that American consumers get the world-class mobile service they expect and value.

The new policy first came to light when Verizon started shipping notices to its unlimited plan customers in July. The carrier tried to play down its significance by saying it wasn't a true throttling program because it didn't automatically restrict speeds to 2G or 3G rates when customers hit a pre-defined data limit each month.

Instead, [company]Verizon[/company] said that the restrictions would only go into effect when the network was congested. If there were unlimited and metered data customers competing for the same bandwidth then Verizon would prioritize the traffic of everyone else over the traffic of its heaviest unlimited customers.

To fall under the guidelines, you would have had to have been an unlimited plan customer on contract in the top 5 percent of Verizon's data users. Even those who fell under the restrictions would be affected rarely, and in many cases they wouldn't even notice it happening, Verizon claimed.

Verizon's unlimited customers weren't happy about the change and neither was the Federal Communications Commission. Already mired in heated net neutrality debate, FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler penned an angry letter to Verizon questioning the new proposal's motives.

""'Reasonable network management' concerns the technical management of your network; it is not a loophole designed to enhance your revenue streams,"" Wheeler said in the letter. ""It is disturbing to me that Verizon Wireless would base its 'network management' on distinctions among its customers' data plans, rather than on network architecture or technology.""

Apparently the customer and regulatory blowback was greater than Verizon anticipated so it decided to can the idea. That said, Verizon is still restricting speeds for its heaviest unlimited users on 3G — it's been doing so for years — but for now those customers will have free reign on Big Red's LTE network.

Devin Gardner crumpled to the ground after Michigan's failed two-point conversion attempt against Ohio State.

In football terms, it was a devastating loss. Financially, Gardner represented eight figures in economic benefit for Michigan, lying in the Michigan Stadium turf.

Analysis by The Michigan Daily shows that in direct revenues, a player like Gardner can add $5.5 million to the University per year. In free advertising alone, Gardner generating more than $8 million through media exposure over one month.

The current NCAA system, which prohibits monetary compensation to student athletes, makes it impossible to precisely evaluate a player's market value. But as the debate over player compensation continues, the question is as important as ever.

Less than a month ago, the high-profile case, Ed O'Bannon V. NCAA, granted class certification to current and future players who are seeking a cut of television revenue and ticket sales for college revenue sports. In 2009, The Atlantic published a 15,000-word article titled, ""The Shame of College Sports."" Earlier this year, Business Insider estimated that the average Michigan football player was worth $470,000.

But for higher-profile players, the revenue potential can soar. The analysis shows that over three years as a starter at wide receiver and quarterback, Gardner can be expected to add upwards of $16.5 million to Michigan in direct revenues, with many more millions in advertising and exposure for the university.

Gardner, like the rest of the NCAA's 450,000 athletes, will receive no direct monetary compensation, though he does receive a scholarship.

THE $5.5-MILLION MEN

In 2011, Robert Brown, a professor of economics at California State University, San Marcos, published a paper in the peer-reviewed Journal of Sports Economics. In it, he estimated the marginal revenue of a NFL-caliber college football player using financial data from 2004-05. Since then, Michigan's football revenues have ballooned from $46.4 million in 2004-05 to $85.2 million in 2011-12 under Athletic Directors Bill Martin and Dave Brandon, the current head of the Athletic Department.

The idea, Brown said, is to control for other factors, and then find ""what an additional NFL-quality college player produces for his football team revenues.""

In 2011-12 figures, Brown's model estimates an average NFL-caliber player adds roughly $5.5 million in direct revenues each year.

For a star player like former Michigan quarterback Denard Robinson, Texas A&M's Johnny Manziel or, to a lesser degree, Gardner, that figure can climb much higher.

""At that extreme level, you can't even say how much,"" said Lawrence Kahn, a professor of economics at Cornell Univeristy, referring to players like Robinson or Manziel. ""All you can say is he's, I'm sure, way more valuable that the average NFL draftable player.""

That is likely true of most quarterbacks who play at Michigan, a school that typically creates NFL-caliber players at the position that often become the face of the program.

""You take Gardner, and you put him at Utah State, he's not going to generate the revenues obviously that he will at Michigan,"" Brown said.

For Gardner, the current quarterback, the conservative $5.5-million estimate puts his value to the program at $16.5 million over a three-year career as a starter.

The players do receive compensation, including scholarships, apparel, travel, training and meals. According to the Knight Commission, Michigan spent $273,863 on each scholarship football player in 2011, ninth most in the nation. For comparison, that's more than 10 times the $26,345 it averages in academic spending for all students.

But James Duderstadt, University president from 1988 to 1996, says that figure is inflated by factors other than direct spending on athletes.

""The fallacy on that is that, in fact, the ($273,863) that is spent on each student is primarily spent on coaches and staff salaries,"" Duderstadt said. In 2011, Michigan spent $8.76 million on salaries for coaches, support staff and administration.

The athletes, he said, are ""the people that are generating the wealth, but the wealth is going to athletic directors, coaches, conference commissioners. None of it, I would add, really goes to the universities.""

IN EXPOSURE VALUE, MORE VALUES

The study's $5.5-million annual figure includes direct revenue sources such as television revenues and ticket sales. But it ignores indirect sources like jersey sales and media exposure.

According to a new report from the Texas Association of Realtors, people are moving to the Lone Star State like crazy. Texas saw a gain of more than half a million residents in 2015, making it one of the states with the highest amount of new residents, second behind Florida. (However, if you subtract the number of Texans who left the same year, the net gain is 107, 689 residents in 2015.)

259597,False,1024,"Texans have long stored oil, natural gas and other forms of energy in underground salt caverns, so it's only natural that a Houston startup wants to store wind energy there, too.

The method is in the company's name, Apex-CAES, where CAES stands for compressed air energy storage. The company plans to use electricity at night, when it's cheap, to compress air into an underground cavern. The company then releases the air through turbines to generate electricity when the price is right.

The only thing holding back this 30-year-old technology has been the economics. The difference between the high and low prices in a 24-hour period has not been large enough to generate a reasonable return on the capital investment.

Texas' wholesale electricity market and huge nightly wind resource, though, make compressed air energy storage viable, said Jack Farley, CEO of Apex-CAES. Build enough compressed air energy storage, and Texas would never have to burn coal again, and consumers would enjoy even lower electricity prices, he told me.

""I think you could turn off all fossil-fuel generators in Texas when you wanted to,"" he said.

Apex-CAES is raising $500 million to build its first facility near Palestine. Located near five existing natural gas storage caverns, the compressed air would spin turbines rated at 317 megawatts, capable of generating 15,000 megawatt-hours of electricity over two days without a recharge. The company, though, would never want to release all the air.

The big opportunity for energy storage companies, whether they use batteries, compressed air or hydroelectric dams, is to keep the electric grid balanced as people turn appliances on and off and while generators ramp up and shut down. Sources of electricity that keep the system smoothed out are called ancillary services, and they earn a premium from grid operators like ERCOT, the nonprofit grid manager that supplies electricity to most of Texas.

ERCOT also pays a premium for responsive reserves, electricity that is immediately available on a moment's notice in case of an emergency. While compressed air energy can't compete with low-priced natural gas or wind in the bulk electricity market, it can compete to offer reliable ancillary services.

Compressed air has both a price and operational advantage over batteries. Salt caverns are cheaper than lithium-ion batteries, and the system can fill the cavern with air while generating electricity. You can't charge and discharge a battery at the same time.

Operators can easily and quickly adjust output to match the needs of the grid - unlike with a natural gas turbine. In many ways, compressed air storage operates like a hydroelectric dam.

""ERCOT uses a regulation product every second of every day. They deploy responsive reserves about eight times per month, every month of the year,"" Farley said. ""We would be there for the grid 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, to balance the system and keep it at 60 hertz.""

The secret sauce is Texas' cheap wind power, which during the spring, fall and much of the winter is basically free at night because there is so much of it.

Texas has 19 gigawatts of installed wind turbine capacity and is expected to add another 10 gigawatts by 2020.

The only thing preventing Texas from building more wind, solar and compressed air energy storage is the low price of natural gas.

With prices averaging below $3 for a million BTUs, the electricity business is a tough place to make a profit right now.

Old attitudes are also a problem. Critics of clean energy complain about the intermittence of wind and solar power, and the high cost of lithium-ion batteries. Sure, solar is strongest during the day and wind produces the most at night, but the weather doesn't always cooperate.

The renewable energy sector, though, is maturing, and because tax credits for it are rolling off by 2020, smart people are working to solve those problems.

Farley has identified suitable salt domes and caverns across most of the U.S. Wind and solar companies are building widely dispersed assets so that when weather is bad at one location, it's probably good at another.

Americans are also waking up to the social benefits of converting to renewable energy and storage. Researchers at Carnegie Mellon University have calculated that shutting down coal plants and replacing them with natural gas has saved tens of thousands of lives. Getting rid of coal altogether would save tens of thousands more.

Apex will need a small amount of natural gas to heat the air it compresses to maximize turbine output. But storage facilities could limit natural gas usage to when demand peaks in the summer and winter while eliminating the need for coal completely.

The power sector is undergoing a revolution, and Americans should embrace and encourage startups like Apex-CAES. Just as innovators found a way to produce natural gas from shale rock and produce huge amounts of oil and natural gas,",0.8033137450802108,0.8033137450802108,0.0,0.0

I'm sure after that story you are inspired to go spray paint something.  Let's make some 2x4 stocking hanger/holders!
  Grab a 2x4.  I cut mine in 7 inch pieces.  Sand those pieces.
Grab a hook of some sort.  Mine is from Home Depot.  It cost me a whole .38 cents.   There are nicer screw in hooks (and more expensive) but this cheap one gets the job done.  The only thing I suggest is not getting one this long.  A shorter one will do the job.  I drilled the hole for the screw.
Use some pliers to twist the screw in.  I couldn't find my pliers so I used this thingamajig.
At this point your project should look something like this.... =-
Add on one of these small craft finials from Lowes.  They just screw in the top of your 2x4.
I took my project into the garage and spray painted it.  While I was waiting I ironed freezer paper onto burlap and printed the kids names out with my printer.  I'm in love with this font.  It's called I'm Bored :)
Cut the burlap to fit on the face of your 2x4 piece and then use Cut Tacks Tachuelas.  I think it's hilarious they are called Tachuelas because when you reach your little fingers in the package it's like a bunch of little Dracula's biting you.  OK not so funny but I thought the name is appropriate.  Tachuelas are great.  You can push them in the wood a little and just use a hammer to complete the job.
Last but not least use Gorilla Glue to secure the two pieces together. 
You're done and your kids will be super happy!
A wall in my house is dedicated to crates right now.  Not because I necessary want a wall of crates but I am storing them for an event.  As they have sat there the past moth I have found...Crates are so useful!  So many fun things to do with them.  They are great for Christmas decorations.  As you can tell by the picture below I use them to store stuff and my kids use them for their Lego's.
 Building a crate is easy.  Here we go with Crate 101....
Grab a piece of wood.  If you are like me you have a ton in the garage.  If not go down to Home Depot and grab what you like.  The piece of wood in the picture below cost about $1.60ish.
Decide what size you want your crate.  I'm going to build a 12x12"" one.  Cut (6) 12 inch pieces.  Then cut 2 of those pieces in half lengthwise as shown in the picture below.
You should now have (4) 12 inch pieces and (4) 6 inch pieces.  Grab you handy dandy air powered staple gun.   If you don't have one you can use nails and a hammer.  I have to admit...this little tool is a lot of fun ;)
Staple the corners together to form a box.
This above picture was so hard to take with my left hand!  Here is a pic of the started box...
 Place your 6 inch pieces on the box you just built (the (2) 12 inch pieces we cut in half lengthwise).
Finally staple or nail those babies on.
Lately I have been using my crates for photo props but you can also use them for decoration.  Grab that crate you just made and paint it dark brown, sand it, make yourself a cute burlap wreath and this is what you get....
I'm not sure exactly how much this cost me to make total because I had all the supplies on hand but if I were to guess I would say about $3.00.  Can't beat that!",0.0,0.7427100791204451,-0.8,0.0
258007,True,364,"David Bowie has offered to write original songs for Claudia Lennear according to the backing singer, who is one of the classic vocalists featured in the Oscar winning documentary 20 Feet From Stardom. Four decades after she is rumoured to have inspired his song Lady Grinning Soul, Lennear claims that her and Bowie will work together on a new project.

""I got a call from David Bowie out of the blue two days ago,"" Lennear told the New York Post earlier this week. ""I couldn't believe it when I first heard his voice. We haven't seen each other in 20 years ... He told me he wanted to write my next project.""

Lennear, who is now in her 60s, was at one time a sought-after back-up singer, performing with stars like George Harrison, Ike and Tina Turner, and Joe Cocker. She was romantically linked with Bowie as well as Mick Jagger, and is said to have inspired the Rolling Stones song Brown Sugar. But although Lennear released one solo album, 1973's Phew!, she never became famous in her own right, and eventually quit the music industry.

Now however, Lennear's star is on the rise. 20 Feet From Stardom won this year's Oscar for best documentary feature and Jagger reportedly wants to turn the film into both a Broadway musical and a scripted TV series.

257855,False,1024,"This week we're going to have an in-depth look into the Age of Wonders III tactical combat mechanics. Tactical combat is one of the most important parts of the game, and we've worked very hard to refine the rules to make it more exciting and tactical. Our main goal was to make combat faster, and more lethal, while maintaining and improving the depth and tactical options that people expect from the series.


Action Points

Each unit has 3 action points that determine how many times it can attack in a round.

You can see here that our Goblin Wolf Rider currently has all 3 left over.

As a unit moves, it loses action points. When a unit is selected, the colored markers on the ground indicate how many action points the unit will have left when it stands in a hex.

Green indicates the unit will have full action points, so it will attack 3 times:

Yellow indicates 2 action points:

Orange indicates 1. Notice that no matter how far a unit moves, it will always keep it's last action point:

Retaliation, Flanking and Guarding

When one unit attacks another with a melee attack, the defending unit will retaliate and strike back. Each time the defender does this, they use up an action point, so once they've retaliated 3 times, they won't be able to retaliate any more. Even worse for the defender, a unit gets it's action points refilled at the end of its turn. So, after retaliating 3 times, the defender won't be able to use the unit themselves next turn!

To demonstrate, lets watch what happens when this filthy human cavalry viciously attacks our poor, innocent goblin wolf rider:

He'll be attacking from a yellow hex, so he'll hit twice. Our heroic goblin has full action points still, so he retaliates twice as well.

Afterwards, it's the goblin's turn, and he still only has 1 action point left. The human just ended his turn, so his action points have already been refilled:

The human has a problem though, he's alone, and exposed. If you can attack a unit from one of the hexes behind it, that attack is a Flanking Attack. Flanking attacks are special for two reasons:

1) The attack gets +2 damage on every type (so +2 physical damage, if a unit also does fire damage it would also get +2 fire damage)

2) A flanked defender cannot retaliate against something behind him, so he loses one chance to retaliate as he turns around.

The goblin marauders are in position to flank now:

Since the attack is flanking, the cavalry will only be able to retaliate once instead of twice. After the flanking attack, the cavalry is facing the marauder, so the next attack does normal damage, and the cavalry can retaliate. The cavalry is now facing the marauder, meaning he can now be flanked again:

As you can see, ranged attacks can flank as well. Even though the target cannot retaliate against them, he will still turn to face the unit shooting him in the back, so only the first shot will receive the flanking bonus. Through clever use of flanking, groups of weak units can take out powerful foes while taking minimal damage themselves.

There is one defense against this, however: A unit can sacrifice its actions for a turn and enter Guard Mode. A unit in Guard Mode cannot be flanked, and gets a 20% bonus to defense and resistance. Guarding units are better at locking down ranged units and performing attacks of opportunity as well, but we'll get to that later.

The clever goblin is in guard mode, so the cavalry cannot flank him, even though he's striking from behind.

Engagement and Attacks Of Opportunity

If a unit is next to an enemy, and facing them, then that enemy is Engaged. Most ranged units cannot use their abilities if they've been engaged by an enemy.

To make matters worse, if a unit tries to move out of a hex where he's engaged by an enemy, that enemy will hit them with an attack of opportunity.

The red triangles tell the human player that moving the archers along the white path would get him hit by two opportunity attacks from goblin skewers.

If the human player flanks the goblins, they will turn away, and the archers could escape in safety. This would not work if the Goblins were guarding however, units on guard can engage in every direction at once, not just in front of them!

Ranged Attacks

Like melee attacks, most ranged attacks get one shot per action point the attacker has. Some slower weapons, such as crossbows, can only fire once per turn. These weapons tend to do more damage, however, and allow a unit to be move more freely without reducing damage output.

Activities for your third trimester

Keep track of your baby's movements

Pay attention to your baby's kicks, twitches, and rolls and let your doctor or midwife know right away if you notice a decrease in movement. Less movement may signal a problem, and you'll need testing to check on your baby's condition. Your healthcare provider may recommend that you spend some time each day counting your baby's kicks – find out how to do ""kick counts.""

Learn about third-trimester prenatal visits and tests

You'll most likely have a checkup every two weeks from 28 to 36 weeks, then switch to once-a-week visits until you deliver. As you and your provider get to know each other better and as your due date draws near, you can expect a mix of regular physical exams, late-pregnancy tests, and discussions about the coming birth.

Find out more about third-trimester prenatal visits.

Consider more classes

In addition to a childbirth class, you may want to consider classes on baby care, breastfeeding, and infant CPR. Many hospitals offer these, and you can also ask your provider or childbirth education teacher for a recommendation.

Prepare for breastfeeding

If you're planning to breastfeed your baby, learn as much as you can about it now. Talk to nursing moms, read articles to familiarize yourself, and consider calling your local La Leche League International chapter or taking a breastfeeding class. The more you know about how to get started and the benefits of nursing, the better.

Choose a doctor for your baby

Get names of pediatricians or family practitioners from friends, co-workers, neighbors, or your prenatal caregiver. Make sure the doctor accepts your health insurance, keeps hours that work with your schedule, and has an office that's convenient for you.

If you can, schedule face-to-face interviews with your top candidates. If it seems too early to be thinking about this, keep in mind that your baby will have his or her first doctor's visit shortly after birth.

Learn more about choosing a doctor for your baby.

Think about big decisions

Would you like to stay home with your baby full- or part-time? If you're having a boy, would you like him to be circumcised? Will you have a religious ceremony after your baby's born? What about banking your baby's cord blood? These are some of the big decisions to think and talk about now.

Assemble your baby gear

This is the perfect job for your partner or a friend who wants to help. Cribs, bassinets, and strollers can be tricky to put together, especially when you're sleep-deprived, so get started now. Swings, mobiles, and monitors usually require batteries, so make sure you have enough on hand. To save money – and help the planet – consider getting rechargeable batteries and a battery charger.

Set up a safe place for your baby to sleep

Whether you plan to have your baby slumber in a crib or bassinet, it's important to follow basic guidelines to reduce your baby's risk of SIDS.

Find out all about making sure your baby's sleeping space is safe.

Talk to your baby

Your baby can hear your voice now, and talking to him or her is a great way to start the bonding process. If having an actual conversation with your bump seems odd, try narrating your daily activities; reading a book, magazine, or newspaper aloud; or sharing your secret wishes for your child.

This is great practice for after your baby's born, too. Talking to babies is one of the best ways to help them develop language skills.

Learn about coping with labor pain

There's no one right way to deliver a baby: Every woman's experience with pain is different and every labor is different. But whether you know you want pain medication during childbirth or a natural birth, it's good to learn about your options now.

Know the stages of labor

For first-time moms, labor takes an average of 15 hours, though it's not uncommon to last more than 20. (For women who've previously had a vaginal birth, it averages eight hours.) The process is divided into three main stages – learn about them so you'll feel prepared for labor and birth.

Create a birth plan

Childbirth is unpredictable, and chances are you won't follow your birth plan to the letter. Still, it's helpful to figure out your preferences beforehand for pain management techniques, who'll be present during delivery, whether your baby will ""room in"" with you after birth, and more.

259388,True,429,"Doxorubicin is a chemotherapeutic agent successfully used in the treatment of a wide range of cancers. However, with cumulative doses, doxorubicin also is known to have cardiotoxic effects, including cardiomyopathy and heart failure. Identification and quantification of myocardial cell damage has been a point of Controversy. We sought to identify these changes by measuring the levels of troponin I both 24 and 48 hr after the administration of doxorubicin as part of an antineoplastic treatment regimen. Thirty-eight patients scheduled to undergo treatment with doxorubicin were screened and approached for enrollment in the study. Thirty-one of them fulfilled all the inclusion criteria and also signed informed consent. All the patients enrolled in the study had blood drawn before the administration of doxorubicin and also 24 and 48 hr later. Electrocardiograms were performed prior to and 48 hr following the administration of chemotherapy. The dose of doxorubicin administered was calculated by the oncologist and ranged from 450 mg/m2-650 mg/m2 (mean 520 mg/m2). Only one patient was found to have en elevation of troponin levels both 24 and 48 hr (2.3 ng/mL and 2.1 ng/mL, respectively) after the administration of the drug. During that time, the patient denied any chest pain, shortness of breath or palpitations. Repeat ECG did not show any changes from the baseline. The remaining participants continued to maintain a troponin level of less than 0.3 ng/mL during the follow-up. In these patients, no electrocardiographic changes were noted in the follow-up ECG compared to the baseline; however, a slight drop in the ejection fraction without any impact on the clinical presentation was recorded. We concluded that the cTnl level does not change after the administration of doxorubicin, and thus cannot be used as a predictor of doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity.",0.6889191085036631,0.7889191085036631,-0.1,0.0

255958,True,741,"As a Flushing development project continues to stall, a City Council candidate is calling for a new vision.

Queens Assemblyman Francisco Moya, who is running for the 21st Council District seat being vacated by outgoing Councilwoman Julissa Ferreras-Copeland, has announced ""a community-minded high bar"" vision for the Willets Point development site.

The politician's proposal comes in the wake of the New York State Court of Appeals ruling that the Queens Development Group's (QDG) plan will not be able to move forward without approval from state legislature due to its situation on parkland. At a post-decision Community Board 7 (CB 7) meeting, a representative for QDG said the group was ""huddling up internally"" to determine the next course of action.

Most recently, New York City Economic Development Corporation (EDC) President James Patchett told CB 7 the city is ""not shying away from the plan"" to develop the site despite the board's allegations the agency was not being cooperative.

""Our city cannot wait longer,"" Moya said in a prepared statement. ""Queens deserves a world-class project that looks toward the future and rejects the failures of the past. Any future negotiations for this blighted community must meet stringent thresholds that benefit working families and seniors here in East Elmhurst and Corona.""

Under Moya's vision, 100 percent of constructed housing at the site would be affordable, with 33 percent reserved for those who have an income of $25,000 or less. Additionally, a retail ""World's Borough Market"" would be built, similarly modeled to the Essex Street Market in the Lower East Side, with all local vendors and businesses. Moya also proposes ""extensive"" environmental remediation at the site and a dedicated funding stream to Flushing Meadows-Corona Park improvements as part of his plan.

The assemblyman has pledged to work with the state legislature to secure the required parkland alienation provisions should his proposal move forward, according to the press release. He did not include details as to how his project would be funded.

Moya also proposes the ""immediate creation"" of a community advisory council, giving the community a venue to voice their thoughts and concerns with the project.

""We must be bold,"" Moya continued. ""I want to see more jobs in our neighborhoods, a requirement to help minority- and women-owned businesses from start to execution, a major economic engine, and the largest affordable housing complex on the development books in our city.""

The lawmaker also takes a shot at fellow candidate Hiram Monserrate, whose ""inaction"" as the former city representative contributed to the project's ""stagnation,"" he alleges.

Monserrate told QNS the deal he made in 2008 regarding the Willets Point project was renegotiated by the current Councilmember, Ferreras-Copeland, and stated Moya was ""ripping a page from the Trump playbook in creating alternative facts.""

""But now that Moya is running for a new seat, he wants our community to believe he is supportive of bringing affordable housing to a community he has ignored for almost a decade,"" Monserrate said. ""He is the candidate of the greedy billionaire developers and a puppet of political insiders that seek to gentrify our neighborhood and price us out all out.""

""We are committed to providing affordable housing and amenities that meet the needs of this community,"" an EDC spokesperson said. ""We look forward to continuing this discussion to determine the next steps for this important project.""",0.7771134551372556,0.7771134551372556,0.0,0.0

PHOENIX — As House Speaker Paul Ryan spoke on the House floor regarding the GOP health care bill, Arizona Rep. Ruben Gallego, a Democrat, yelled ""where's the score.""

Rep. Ruben Gallego yelled ""where's the score"" during Ryan's pre vote speech — Alex Gangitano (@AlexGangitano) May 4, 2017

Gallego confirmed the reported outburst on CNN.

His complaint was for the lack of a Congressional Budget Office (CBO) score on the American Health Care Act, the GOP's attempt to repeal and replace Obamacare. The CBO ""provides the Congress with several hundred formal cost estimates that analyze the likely effects of proposed legislation on the federal budget,"" per the office's website.

Gallego didn't seem to regret raising his grievance so boisterously.

""This is a new time in politics where people are just blatantly lying and, essentially, producing policies that are going to kill people,"" he told CNN's Brianna Keilar. ""So, I think the old time of civility needs to go until we actually go back to the rules. But right now we're about to kick off 24 million people off of health insurance.

""Somebody yelling for accountability and asking for CBO is not the thing we should really be worried about.""

He also took to Twitter to jab at Arizona Senators John McCain and Jeff Flake, both Republicans.

255898,False,1024,"OK, I gotta butt in here and say something real quick. This'll only take a second.

A lot of us have double consciousness on the whole religion question.

Double consciousness is this idea from the black antireligious (probably atheist) badass co-founder of the NAACP W.E.B. Du Bois, who called himself a freethinker, refused to participate in public prayer, and stated: "" I flatly refused again to join any church or sign any church creed. From my 30th year on I have increasingly regarded the church as an institution which defended such evils as slavery, color caste, exploitation of labor and war.""

Here's the deal with double consciousness: When you're black, Du Bois wrote in the segregation era of 1903, you're looking at yourself through the eyes of other people. And the whole problem with this is that the way people see you is simply not — not at all — who you are.

I mean, yeah – that's what people told you that you were. But it wasn't who you actually were. You were actually a hell of a lot more than that, according to Du Bois. Black people — first human beings on earth, first great civilizations, rich history, etc….diminished to thinking that they are slaves or second-class citizens. Diminished to bow down to ""yessuh"" and ""yes'm."" Diminished to think that they are scum, that they are naturally violent bums, that they are born with poverty in their DNA, when we — well, the late great Richard Pryor put it as, ""We were the kings of the earth.""

Now, you may not be ""hotep"" enough to jive with all that, but that's not the point of this post. Keep reading, white people. I'm coming round to you.

What W.E.B. Du Bois said was to get in touch with that — that there was something in us black people that was beautiful drop-dead gorgeous and defiant and beautiful. He opened up a doorway into a new view of our history, giving it some dignity — or at least that was the goal.

And yet, in the midst of this private realization, there is the public realization of who I am — the American context I am striving to get rights in. There is my past, and my heritage, but there is also the current moment, and the two sides inform each other.

And for me, a young black man reading this 1903 essay, this was a revelation. I was not second class. I had a rich history, a rich heritage, a beautiful past I could claim and associate with the history of my skin. Also, I could use my knowledge and confidence from this heritage to craft a black identity in the United States. The two sides informed each other.

As an atheist, though, I've run into the same problem. I don't want to sound like a whiner when I say that people call me names…but people call me names.

And they label me. They tell me I'm a second class citizen in the Bible Belt, that I'm somehow a second-class human being, that if I don't say I believe a godman rose from a stone-cold grave after he was stone-cold dead 2000 years ago according to some scribblings from who-knows-who, I'm one of the ""Unsaved."" An ""infidel.""

And they want me to take it. They want me to accept it — and they're willing, oftentimes, to smile and act nice, as long as I take it and tolerate it.

You may fight it for awhile. You might say that you're more than that for awhile. You may be insulted and protest for awhile. But sooner or later, you're supposed to see yourself through their eyes, and Understand.

And then it's going to be OK. Then you're going to accept the way they see you, take it into yourself, and live it out. You'll be satisfied with being a second-class human being, and you won't make as many waves.

I'm writing that to say this — if it's gotten to you, I want to remind you that you are not second class. You know this. You know that you come from a history of people who have defied the most powerful religious authorities in history, people who dared to doubt, people who dared to stand up for reason and empathy and dignity in other individuals instead of urging them to bend the knee to a puppet-God controlled by moneyed special interests, politician, and moneygrubbing preachers.

You know this. It's just hard to remember, sometimes. And it's oh-so-easy to accept that you're second class when people smile so brightly when you have the ""dignity"" to so abase themselves before the ""humility""",0.0,0.7273689625745123,-1.1,-0.1

259192,True,707,"Almarai Co., Saudi Arabia's largest dairy company, has bought about 14,000 acres in drought-stricken Southern California and Arizona in an effort to grow hay for its massive herd of cows. The purchase has fueled debate over whether a patchwork of laws and court rulings give too much weight to growers of thirsty crops such as alfalfa. Some answers to common questions about the deal:

___

Q: Why is Saudi Arabia's largest dairy company buying U.S. land?

A: To conserve water, the country has adopted bans on selected crops. Agriculture accounted for 90 percent of Saudi Arabia's water consumption, according to a 2013 study by the Oxford Business Group.

Saudi Arabia identified the United States as one of 16 countries for agricultural investment in 2010, according to a memo from the U.S. embassy in Riyadh to the U.S. Agriculture Department that was obtained by WikiLeaks. The embassy said the investment could be ""a tangible demonstration of the value of outreach to the Muslim world and (could) offer an opportunity to broaden and deepen our relationship."" The memo noted that while food security has not been a major problem in Saudi Arabia, ""food prices have become politically sensitive.""

___

Q: What do the locals think?

A: Some have raised concern about the amount of water needed but many welcome the economic boost that Almarai has given as worries about China have dimmed prospects for alfalfa exports. Jack Seiler, who farms about 3,800 acres in Palo Verde Valley, now sells about 30 percent of his harvest to Almarai, compared with nothing a few years ago.

""They're banging it out, I'm telling you,"" said Seiler. ""They kind of cleaned us out of summer hay … They want to farm.""

Seiler voices more concern about the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California. Last year, the nation's largest distributor of drinking water became Palo Verde Valley's largest landowner, tapping a deep distrust between farm and city that pervades the West.

___

Q: What are the water rights in these areas?

A: Palo Verde Valley enjoys California's first rights to water from the Colorado River, a lifeline to seven Western U.S. states and northern Mexico. A 1922 compact that parceled out allotments gave California more than 10 times what Nevada got.

California long consumed more Colorado River water than it was entitled to, which was never a problem until Sunbelt cities like Phoenix and Las Vegas began to clamor for their full share. A 2003 truce among California's warring water agencies kept the Palo Verde Irrigation District at the front of the line and also left the agricultural Imperial Valley near the top of the pecking order. That honored a Gold Rush era-doctrine that the first settlers to stake claim hold the highest-priority rights.

La Paz County, Arizona, is free of well-pumping restrictions that hamstring many of the state's largest cities under a 1980 law to protect aquifers. The city of Phoenix bought about 13,000 acres there in 1986 and sold it in 2012 after giving up on building infrastructure to carry water about 100 miles to the nation's sixth-largest city. The city of Scottsdale has about 1,200 acres in the area on the premise that it will eventually have a system to move water from farm to city.",0.6684413088182722,0.7684413088182722,-0.1,0.0

Rogers acknowledged that the revelations about the scope of the National Security Agency's surveillance programs have ""damaged the perception"" of CISPA. But he said the ""sheer determination"" of Feinstein and Chambliss gives him hope that Congress would move ahead on the bill.

He said he is working with the senators on tweaks to the bill to provide more oversight and privacy protections.

CISPA would remove legal barriers that prevent companies from sharing information with each other and the government about cyberattacks. It would also allow the government to share more information with the private sector.

Rogers argued that the bill is necessary to help companies get the information they need to thwart attacks on their systems.

But privacy advocates fear that CISPA would give the NSA access to a vast new trove of private information.

Vice President-elect Mike Pence and Trump also railed against specific members of the media for reporting the unverified report following Spicer's presentation.

BuzzFeed and the Republican National Committee, where Spicer was the communications director and chief strategist, signed an agreement to ""spend a significant amount on political advertisements slated to run during the Fall election cycle,"" in April 2016, according to Politico.

Colorectal cancers are the third most diagnosed cancers in the U.S.

Plant-based diets may also contribute to greater weight loss and lower blood pressure

(CNN) Dropping red meat, and sticking to a plant-based diet that incorporates fish may be the key to preventing colorectal (colon and rectum) cancers, according to a seven-year study published Monday. Pescetarians, as they are commonly referred, had a 43% lower chance of getting the cancer compared to people with omnivorous diets.

Why focus on colorectal cancer? It is the third most diagnosed cancer, and the third leading cause of cancer-related death in the US in 2014, according to American Cancer Society statistics. The disease is particularly dangerous because it is usually asymptomatic in its early stages, making it more difficult to detect when it's less deadly. Only 59% of those recommended for screenings receive procedures that are in line with the American Cancer Society's standards

Yet another study from last year found an average weight loss of nearly 7.5 pounds for vegetarians.

While evidence shows the health benefits of reducing red meat consumption, the recent study highlights the differences between even a fully vegetarian diet and a pescetarian diet. Within the sample group there was a 27% drop in the risk of contracting colorectal cancer if you switch from fully vegetarian to eating fish. The authors of the study suggest that omega-3 fatty acids may be the key to such a low risk of cancer in the pescetarian group.

Pistons-Pacers Preview

By NOEY KUPCHAN

Posted Jan 16 2015 9:57AM

Just when it looked like the Detroit Pistons had turned things around, they took a big step back last time out.

The Indiana Pacers are also looking to regroup after letting what appeared to be a couple of easy matchups get away.

Detroit tries to avoid losing two in a row for the first time in almost four weeks as it visits Indiana, where the Pistons have badly struggled but enter Friday night seeking their longest road winning streak in nearly 13 years.

The Pistons scored 94.4 points per game in opening 5-23, but they've averaged 105.8 in winning nine of 11 since releasing Josh Smith - with the first of those victories coming 119-109 over Indiana on Dec. 26. Detroit (14-25), however, reverted to its old ways in Wednesday's 105-94 loss to a last-place New Orleans team.

En route to their lowest point total in 14 games, the Pistons were outscored 58-36 in the first half and trailed by double digits throughout the second. Detroit was outrebounded 47-30, its worst effort on the glass this season.

""That was a bad performance, and we have to make sure it stops tonight,"" coach Stan Van Gundy said. ""We didn't do anything. We didn't rebound and we didn't protect the paint, which were two big areas of emphasis. We brought absolutely no energy whatsoever to the game.""

The Pistons haven't dropped back-to-back games since Dec. 19 and 21.

They could like their chances of extending that streak on the road, where they've won six in a row for the first time since March 2007. Detroit hasn't put together seven consecutive road victories since Jan. 18-Feb. 22, 2002.

""We're always a little bit worse at home and we have been all year,"" Van Gundy said. ""Even during the 5-23 stretch we were better on the road. I don't know what that's all about, but we are a much more energetic team on the road than we are at home.""

They haven't enjoyed much success in Indianapolis, however. Detroit has lost 11 of its past 12 visits, with the last three defeats coming by an average of 19.3 points.

The bulk of those games, though, came against Pacers teams which finished first or second in the Central Division. The loser of this matchup will be alone in the Central basement.

Indiana (15-25) had won four of five at home - its best stretch there this season - before falling 110-101 to Western Conference-worst Minnesota on Tuesday. The Pacers were outscored 41-26 in the fourth quarter as the Timberwolves snapped a 15-game losing streak behind Mo Williams' career-high 52 points.

Indiana had been coming off a 93-92 loss at lowly Philadelphia three nights earlier.

""It's no fun losing to teams with poor records. It's no fun. But it's a long season,"" coach Frank Vogel said. ""We believe in what we do. We believe in who we have in the locker room.""

C.J. Miles scored 22 points against Minnesota and is averaging 19.4 over his last seven home games. He started in place of former Pistons guard Rodney Stuckey, who finished with 13 points while battling food poisoning.

Stuckey scored nine in his first matchup against his former team last month. Andre Drummond had 20 points, Greg Monroe added 19 with 15 rebounds and Brandon Jennings scored 14 to go with 10 assists as Detroit shot a season-high 54.7 percent.

Men of War: Assault Squad is the new title in the ""Men of War"" series. Assault Squad takes place across the globe during the height of World War II and features a completely new cooperative skirmish game mode with access to five different nations (Russia, Germany, USA, Commonwealth and- for the first time ever in the Men of War series- Japan) as well as increased realism and accessibility. The expansion pack will deliver fans and newcomers an intense new WW2 spectacle with almost limitless replayability.

Like previous games in the series, Men of War: Assault Squad includes the unique ""direct control"" feature which enables players to maneuver units using the directional keys, rather than pointing and clicking. PC Generals can get behind the controls of a tank to smash through obstacles, crush soldiers under its tracks and fire armor-piercing shells at enemy emplacements, or take control of individual soldiers as they fight.

What makes the new skirmish game mode so unique?

Different historical settings and battlegrounds for every nation will ensure that each time players will face a different variety of enemies and tactics.

Unique hero units for every nation with powerful abilities such as increasing units' firepower, boosting morale or providing other advantages to defeat the enemy against all odds.

Fantastic bonus abilities such as remote controlled bombs that can flatten entire residential blocks, airstrikes able to destroy incoming tank columns, special ""For the Motherland!"" charge attacks and many more.

Improved and dynamic AI ensures that no two games will play out the same way, making each battle a new experience against an AI that really fights back.

A 2D programming language with arrows.

The documentation is very spartanic, but I hope you can get all the information you need from it.

This is a little programming language that follows arrows around the file.

The program starts at: ↤, ↥, ↦ or ↧ and then follows the given direction. If ←, ↑, →, ↓, ↖, ↗, ↘, ↙ are hit the program will follow their direction.

The code can also modify itself.

There are operations, which are basically commands. Some have results, some do actions.

Let's look at a little program.

↦ M 2 2 ""+"" M 2 8 ""X"" ↓ ↑ P ←

Okay, there's a lot going on in this. Let's start at ↦, which tells the program to start there. Now, M is called. M is the modify operation. It modifies the character at [2, 2] to be a plus. This changes the M into a +. + is an add operation, and it takes two arguments, like this:

1 3 => 4 After that, there is another modify operation which modifies the character on [2, 8] to be a X. X simply terminates the program. The program would now look like this:

↦ + 2 2 X+"" M 2 8 ""X"" ↓ ↑ P ←

Now there's an arrow which redirects the program. Now we hit P, which prints the result of the next operation. The next operation is + 2 2, so it will print 4. X terminates the program.

These are the current operations:

A assigns a variable to a value.

A example 5

will assign 5 to example.

P prints a value.

P example

will print 5.

p example

will print 5 without linebreak.

"""" is a string.

P ""Hello World!""

will print Hello World!

The operations +, -, /, * and % work as you would think they do.

=, < and > are conditional operators. They work like math operations, and return 1 for true and 0 for false.

! inverts 1 to 0 and 0 to 1.

? is an if operation. After testing, they follow the arrows ↿, ⇃, ↼, ⇀ if the condition is true.

A grant will allow 826 Valencia to open a second site in the Tenderloin.

A beloved and unique pirate-themed shop that doubles as a literary organization seeking to make writing fun for kids is planning to open a second location in The City after 12 years in the Mission.

Named for its physical location, 826 Valencia has received a three-year, $500,000 grant from an anonymous foundation that will allow the nonprofit to open a Tenderloin site as early as August 2015, said Executive Director Bita Nazarian.

Founded in 2002 by educator Ninive Calegari and author Dave Eggers, 826 Valencia supports writing aspirations among 6- to 18-year-olds through one-on-one attention and programs that produce various student publications. It also encourages teachers to inspire students to write.

The new site will maintain the original location's ""brand of whimsy and fun and creativity,"" according to Nazarian, and will serve an additional 2,000 students per year. The organization currently serves about 6,000 students annually, including at its annexed locations at three San Francisco Unified School District campuses.

For the next year, 826 Valencia will spend planning for its new site, which will likely also include some retail space. It's trying to raise an additional $2 million to help secure a location and continue programming for the next several years, said Nazarian.",0.7260554609735048,0.7260554609735048,0.0,0.0

258721,True,585,"Stress often drives us to pursue a reward (dessert, drink, new 'toy') more intensely, but new Swiss research has found that we're no more likely to enjoy the indulgence than an unstressed person with the same treat.

The findings are published in the Journal of Experimental Psychology: Animal Learning and Cognition.

""Most of us have experienced stress that increases our craving for rewarding experiences, such as eating a tasty bar of chocolate, and it can make us invest considerable effort in obtaining the object of our desire, such as running to a convenience store in the middle of the night,"" said lead author Eva Pool, M.S., a doctoral student at the University of Geneva.

""But while stress increases our desire to indulge in rewards, it does not necessarily increase the enjoyment we experience.""

During the study, stress prompted chocolate lovers to exert three times as much effort to smell chocolate than unstressed chocolate lovers, and yet both groups reported similar levels of enjoyment when they got a whiff of the pleasing aroma.

Researchers recruited 36 male and female university students who said they love chocolate. To induce stress, the participants were asked to keep one hand in ice-cold water while being observed and videotaped. Another group immersed a hand in lukewarm water.

Ten minutes before and 30 minutes after the experiment, researchers collected samples of the students' saliva and tested them for levels of cortisol, a stress hormone.

Finally, all subjects had to press a handgrip for the chance to smell chocolate when they saw a certain symbol. The researchers measured their efforts at the chance to smell chocolate and asked then participants how pleasant they found the odor.

""Stress plays a critical role in many psychological disorders and is one of the most important factors determining relapses in addiction, gambling, and binge eating,"" said another author, Tobias Brosch, Ph.D., also of the University of Geneva.

""Stress seems to flip a switch in our functioning: If a stressed person encounters an image or a sound associated with a pleasant object, this may drive them to invest an inordinate amount of effort to obtain it.""

Prior studies with laboratory rats support the idea that wanting and enjoying depend on two distinct networks of neurons that can be activated independently.

""Although the findings with rodents provide a novel explanation for the stress-induced increase of reward pursuits, to the best of our knowledge, they have never been demonstrated in humans,"" the study said.

More research on people is necessary to confirm the findings, according to the authors, who recommend future studies that would explore the effect of more intense everyday life stressors on human wanting and enjoying.

The father of fugitive Edward Snowden told NBC News that he believes his son would return to the United States if he were assured that he would not be jailed before trial or subjected to a gag order.

Lonnie Snowden told journalist Michael Isikoff that he has not spoken since April with his son — who is believed to be hiding in a Moscow airport to evade arrest by U.S. authorities.

Edward Snowden went into hiding in early June, after information he provided about U.S. data surveillance programs was published by The Washington Post and Guardian newspapers. He has said he revealed the information because he feared that the programs were violating the rights of private citizens. He has been charged with leaking classified documents.

The portion of the interview that aired on the ""Today"" show Friday morning did not explain how the elder Snowden had developed his opinion as to the conditions under which his 30-year-old son might return home.

Lonnie Snowden sent a letter to Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. with his suggestions about how to get his son to return to this country, Isikoff reported. In the interview, he said he knew his son had broken the law but does not think he committed treason.

A cafe has had to apologise after selling smoothies with swastikas on the bottles.

The almond milk and peanut butter drinks were on sale for £3.95 at a London coffee shop called Nincomsoup.

Called 'Nutzy', it seems that one staff member at the Old Street Tube Station shop thought it appropriate to give the product a 'Nazi theme'.

The smoothies were removed from sale after a Jewish customer noticed the branding and complained.

The shopper told Campaign Against Antisemitism that they asked to speak to a manager at Nincomsoup. They were told that it was a pun on 'having the nuts', not in any way a pun on the word 'Nazi'.

The 'Nutzy' featured swastikas

""He asked why I would find that so offensive, to which I responded that I lost my family to the Nazi regime and that despite the Hindu use of the symbol, this along with the name of the drink was extremely offensive,"" the customer explained.

""He said that London is a free city. I left the shop almost in tears and shivering as it proved to me how much antisemitism and fascism is still utterly present.

""That man had no shame whatsoever to tell me that I should not be offended by what I saw, when the use of the swastika and the name of that drink is clearly not a coincidence.""

(Image: Getty)

A spokesman for the Campaign Against Antisemitism said: ""It beggars belief that this shop created a Nazi-branded drink by unwitting coincidence.

""The Nazis murdered six million Jewish men, women and children during the Second World War as well as almost half a million people from Britain alone in the most devastating war and genocide ever committed.""

The organisation added that mockery of the Holocaust is not in itself a criminal offensive, so it contacted the shop, the media, and Transport for London to complain.

Rogue employee

Nincomsoup stated that it was a ""rogue employee"" who was to blame. They have since been fired.

Founder Ben Page-Philiips issued an apology and said: ""Sadly, an employee deemed it appropriate to put a Swastika on a smoothie named The Nutzy.

""This was unsanctioned and the bottles were removed immediately upon being alerted by our shop manager. Needless to say the rogue employee has been dismissed.

""This was incomprehensible, extremely insensitive, and upsetting to all of us. We unreservedly apologise.""

255700,True,528,"POLICE must be given the power to arrest suspects on the spot to issue them with apprehended domestic violence orders, according to a multi-party report.

A NSW upper house committee has called for the Crimes Act to be toughened to better protect victims of domestic abuse. The committee said the law should allow police to arrest and detain aggressors immediately. It should also allow third parties to apply for orders on behalf of someone who is physically or mentally impaired.

Another one of the 84 recommendations urges the government to allow police ranked sergeants or above to issue interim ADVOs.

Among the 84 recommendations delivered to the NSW government yesterday five ask for the Act to be toughened.

Assistant Commissioner Mark Murdoch told the inquiry that when police were about to apply for a provisional AVO, they could not arrest the suspected aggressor unless he refused to stay put until the order is served.

Upper House Labor MP Helen Westwood said in many cases the person fled by the time officers returned. ""This change would give police the power to serve the AVO and the conditions would apply immediately,"" she said.

Mr Murdoch said this would improve safety for victims of domestic violence.

""We would also argue that having the ability to remove the perpetrator from the home, if that is where the incident has occurred, gives time for the whole situation to de-escalate, gets the perpetrator out of the place and cools his heels at the police station for as long as it takes to make an application for the order, do the paperwork and give it to him,"" he said. ""He still gets his day in court.""

In a written submission to the inquiry NSW Police said there was a risk of further violence and property damage in the time it took police to do the paperwork.

The Police Association argued it would not be an excessive deprivation of liberty, using the analogy that a similar situation applied to driver breath testing - a person with a positive reading was taken to a police station for another test.

Last year there were 26,808 reported domestic violence cases in NSW but the Bureau of Crime Statistics and Research said less than half of cases were reported.

In Sydney, Campbelltown has the highest recorded rates of domestic violence per capita, followed by Blacktown, Penrith, Wyong and Holroyd.

Minister for Women Pru Goward, who ordered the inquiry last year, said the government would develop a new policy in response to the report by next year.

258468,True,555,"The sequel to Mod Guide 2 : Fit v1 continues to emphasize the importance of fit. Guys, the size of your shirt does not define your masculinity. If you wear a large tshirt and it fits, cool. If the shirt is too big on you, chances are, you don't look as manly as you think you do. Don't let size get in the way of looking good. Girls, tight is not always the way to go and your tank tops are not meant to be a second skin. Just make sure you know what flatters your body type.. a whole other topic.

Suits are investment pieces. If you have to spend $300+ on a suit, it's a good idea to make sure it is the right size. Consult an in-store tailor or sales associate before buying your suit. If you were fortunate enough to score a great deal on a suit at sales/no return or exchange venues or events (like the famous/infamous Barneys Warehouse Sale), then definitely ask a sales associate for his/her opinion. If you still have doubts after having bought the suit, take it to your tailor and get his/her opinion on the fit.

I say your tailor because you should have one. A tailor to call your own. As you purchase more investment pieces, frequent visits to the tailor is necessary. Retailers do not produce clothes that will custom fit your body. Their goal is to sell as much as possible, and so most clothes are mass-produced based on a pre-set garment ""mold"". Suits, dress shirts, skirts, jeans and pants/slacks should visit the tailor at least once, unless you're blessed with a perfect sized body.

This is an example of a bad fit. The extra fabric makes the look messy and unkempt. The sleeves are too long and eventually, the excess material will crease, which is NOT good.

The shirt in this look fits snugly, but it isn't too tight. The collar is tight, the tie is a good length and width, and the pants sit on the waist and isn't baggy so that it requires a belt. Your shirt doesn't need to be this snug. You can ask your tailor to make it a little looser if you prefer it that way. Fashion is about looking good, but it is also about feeling comfortable. You shouldn't feel like you cant breathe.

Lesson of the day : The tailor is your best friend. Going to a tailor may sound like a hassle (and pricey), but once you start getting compliments on the fit of your clothes, you'll definitely go back for more!

If you like chocolate milk – I've got a deal for you. You can drink more of it. In fact, you can replace your after-workout recovery drink with it. Cause it's been scientifically proven to aide muscle recovery just as much as Gatorade.

""In the study, nine male cyclists rode until their muscles were depleted of energy, then rested four hours and biked again until exhaustion. During the rest period, the cyclists drank low-fat chocolate milk, Gatorade, or Endurox R4. During a second round of exercise, the cyclists who drank the chocolate milk were able to bike about 50% longer than those who drank Endurox, and about as long as those who drank the Gatorade.""

And it's not just random scientists that's drinking the stuff after workouts. My former hometown University of Washington Huskies football team even uses it after every practice. Each player is required to drink a small carton before leaving the field.

""The Huskies are experimenting with a new form of nutritional replacement following practices. Along with giving the usual water and sports drinks to rehydrate and replenish during grueling preseason practices, Washington's football staff is requiring its players to drink a small carton of fat-free chocolate milk.

So there ya have it – do you really need any more excuse now to down chocolate?

I've actually been using it since last summer and I've found it works pretty well. While I can't scientifically pinpoint chocolate milk as helping me personally to recover, I can say it seem to help…and heck – it certainly tastes better than some of the recovery drinks out there.

Speaking of which, I usually just make my own chocolate milk from Hershey's Chocolate Syrup. I recently noticed that they have a 'Lite' version that has 50% less calories. I figured I'd give it a shot. Based on my extensive testing (really, it was hard work!), it tastes the same. The only interesting thing I've noticed is that it doesn't seem to mix as easily as the regular stuff. Meaning, it takes a bit more oomph to get it to mix 'cleanly' into the chocolate milk. Ya know…like 4-5 more seconds of work. Just in case you were curious about the difference between the two options.

We learned that the service would be about $10 a month; that would include no ads and offline playback — much like the company's current YouTube Music Key offering, which focuses on music videos. Additionally, it sounds like Google will jump further into the rapidly-expanding original content arena, putting itself up against offerings from Amazon, Netflix, and Hulu (among others).

It's not surprising that Google has signed up the majority of those content producers making the videos that populate YouTube — as we learned earlier, YouTube's creators are required to participate in the subscription offering or have their videos set to private. Whether this new subscription model will be as profitable for massively popular creators like PewDiePie as the current, ad-supported model remains to be seen.",0.8234393621565737,0.8234393621565737,0.0,0.0

Neil Gaiman has teased his plans for the planned HBO series of his novel American Gods.

The acclaimed fantasy writer confirmed earlier this year that he was working with the premium US broadcaster on a TV version of his hit novel. HBO looks to be expanding its fantasy output after the recent smash hit Game Of Thrones.

Now, Gaiman has revealed more about his plans for the drama, saying that it will not be completely faithful to the book. He told MTV News: ""I'm worrying about it one episode at a time [and] one season at a time. The overall plan right now is that the first season would essentially be… the first book, with a few interesting divergences. You don't want the people who've read the book to be able to go, 'I know everything that's going to be happening.' Well, no. You know a lot more than anybody who is starting from here, but we will do things that will surprise you, too.""

He added that the scope of a long-running TV series would allow him to explore the world created in his original 2001 novel. ""There was always so much more plot for American Gods and… what happens in the fall-out, so we're just going to follow it along.""

259911,True,668,"In the 62nd minute of Minnesota United's 3-2 loss at Toronto FC on Saturday, Kevin Molino stepped up and took a terrible penalty kick that rolled right into the arm of Toronto goalkeeper Alexander Bono.

But here's what makes Molino worthy of United's big-money transaction that brought him to the MLS expansion team this offseason: He strolled right back up to the blocked ball and coolly slotted home the rebound.

That goal was Molino's second of the match and the second time he started the Loons' ultimately unsuccessful comeback. Several other attacking players had golden opportunities to score, including rookie Abu Danladi in the first half and substitute Johan Venegas late in the second. Only Molino capitalized.

The Trinidad and Tobago native has started and played 10 matches for United, missing one because of national team duty. He has five goals and three assists this season. But before the Toronto match, his last goal was in a 4-2 victory over Salt Lake on April 1, and his last assist was in a 2-2 draw at Houston on April 15.

The reason for Molino's sudden uptick in offense might have a bit to do with a lineup adjustment. Molino has played mostly on the right wing this season. But against Toronto, he played more centrally in a playmaking position. Danladi took his spot on the right.

""We put him underneath … to try to get him a bit more involved in the game and to try and see if he can link up with Ibson,"" coach Adrian Heath said. ""We've got the two midfield players [who] are both very good first touch, and they can find the little pockets of space in behind. And that's when Kevin's at his best. So I just wanted to see if we could get him on the ball a little bit more … and I thought we did a little bit.""

Molino

Molino, though, isn't one to wax poetic about his two goals Saturday. Instead, he lamented the wasted chance of bringing the momentum of a big victory against one of the league's top teams into Sunday's matchup with the LA Galaxy at TCF Bank Stadium.

""Most important, the game is a team sport, and we all want to go home happy together, collectively, with three points,"" Molino said in a team news release. ""The two goals are good to keep my confidence up, and I look forward to the next game against the LA Galaxy.""

Heath said the challenge with Molino is just to give him opportunities. Because as the penalty-kick-gone-wrong-turned-right evidenced, Molino won't squander them.

""He's a quality footballer,"" Heath said. ""I expected before this season started, he'd get double figures in both categories [goals and assists]. So if he stays healthy, he'll get his 12 to 13 goals.

""But more importantly, we need to keep him involved in the game because that's the hardest thing with football, to score and make goals. So the more we can keep him active and in and around the game and the ball, the better he's going to be.""",0.6262764176900552,0.7262764176900551,-0.1,0.0

Trainees file off a rifle range after completing an iteration of rifle marksmanship training with the Syrian Democratic Forces in northern Syria on July 31, 2017. An American citizen who had been fighting for the Islamic State, surrendered to the U.S.-backed Syrian Democratic Forces in eastern Syria on or about Sept. 12 and was transferred to U.S. military custody.

WASHINGTON — The U.S. military has detained an American captured in Syria fighting for the Islamic State, the Pentagon said Thursday.

The American citizen surrendered to U.S.-backed Syrian Democratic Forces in eastern Syria on or about Sept. 12 and was transferred to U.S. military custody, said Marine Maj. Adrian Rankine-Galloway, a Pentagon spokesman said.

""The U.S. citizen is being legally detained by Department of Defense personnel as a known enemy combatant,"" he said. ""…[ISIS] fighters who are captured are safe guarded and treated humanely.""

Enemy fighters on the battlefield will be killed or captured regardless of their citizenship, he added.

Rankine-Galloway declined to say exactly where the fighter was captured in Syria or where he was being held, citing operational security concerns.

Syrian Democratic Forces – an umbrella group that includes some 50,000 Kurdish and Arab anti-ISIS fighters in northern and eastern Syria – are conducting combat operations now in the former ISIS capital of Raqqa and in the Middle Euphrates River Valley north of Deir el-Zour, a small city where officials believe much of the terrorist group's leadership fled before Raqqa was invaded.

The U.S. military has provided weapons, training, special operations advisers and air and artillery power to the SDF as the group has pushed ISIS out of more than half its territory in Syria during the last two years.

The American ISIS fighter, whose name was not released, will be turned over to the Justice Department for prosecution, Rankine-Galloway said.

A spokeswoman for the Department of Justice did not have an immediate comment when reached by phone Thursday.

It is not the first time an American has been accused of fighting for ISIS.

In June, Mohamad Jamal Khweis, 27, was convicted in federal court of providing material support to ISIS. The Justice Department said Khweis traveled to Syria through Turkey to join ISIS in December 2015 and spent about 2 1/2 months traveling with ISIS fighters and undergoing religious training.

Khweis lived in Alexandria, Virginia, and was captured by Kurdish peshmerga forces near Tal Afar in northern Iraq in March 2016.

He is scheduled to be sentenced Oct. 13 and faces a minimum penalty of five years in prison and a maximum penalty of life in prison, according to the Justice Department.

259956,True,908,"If you're an ecommerce business or selling any sort of products to consumers, you've likely come across product recommendation systems. Anyone making a purchase from bigger online brands like Amazon or NetFlix has likely been recommended books to buy or videos to watch. Indeed, many marketers and sales consultants have written about the effectiveness of product recommenders increasing sales.

What do product recommenders do?

The problem solved by product recommenders is simple to state but difficult to do: take all your customers' past behaviors and find which products they are likely to buy next. Such recommendations solve two problems:

Determine the next product to buy. Most companies have too many products for customers to easily manage and browse. Giving them a ranked list, optimized for their tastes, will make it easier for them to buy something new. Lead lists for outbound campaigns. Similarly, if you are a company with a large number of customers, choosing which to contact or e-mail can be a costly decision. Product recommenders let you rank which customers are likely to buy a certain product, so you can target your sales efforts more effectively.

One of the most well-known forms of product recommendation is called ""collaborative filtering"". In one form of this filtering, customer purchase histories are compared to each other. Those with similar purchases are then grouped together and products that the group likes, but which a certain individual in the group has yet to buy, will be recommended.

As an example, suppose you are someone who has previously watched all Star Wars and Indiana Jones movies, but nothing else. A collaborative filter could see that others who have similar patterns have also watched the lesser-known ""American Graffiti"", and this would then be recommended to you.

Best-in-class recommendation engines

Most product recommenders, particularly for smaller companies, suffer from what is known as the ""cold start"" problem. If you have too few recommendations or if a customer has never made a purchase, how do you know what to recommend? More importantly, once they start buying, how do you make the recommendation as accurate as possible?

At Canopy Labs, we approach the problem through ""cross-domain"" recommendations. Rather than taking past purchases by themselves, we look at all aspects of a customer's behavior to better understand what they are like and make recommendations. Here is the data we take into account:

Email activity. Imagine that every email communication you send your customers were also a product. Those who open e-mails and click links are implicitly showing their preferences for content and offers. We use this to group people in a similar way we group through purchases.

We use this to group people in a similar way we group through purchases. Website browsing. As with emails, people browsing a website are implicitly making a decision to follow certain links, content, or ideas. We track this data to segment customers and also look at individual decisions for product recommendations.

Depending on industry and size of the company, the way you take into account the information above differs. For example, North American fashion retailers tend to benefit from past purchases and email activity — possibly because fashion trends are somewhat similar across North America. On the other hand, local commerce sites (e.g., daily deals websites, discount sites, etc.) often require demographic information to be taken into account for their product recommenders. This is likely because many of their products are location-specific and not available in all regions.

259346,False,1024,"Denver's new independent monitor Nicholas Mitchell will have more staff to monitor cop and deputy misconduct cases and a larger budget as he helps guide improvements to policies followed by the city police and sheriff's departments.

Mitchell, formerly a commercial litigator with Silver & DeBoskey in Denver, was appointed in August by Mayor Michael Hancock. He replaces Richard Rosenthal, who left in January to take a job as British Columbia's first independent police monitor.

Mitchell's staff of six will grow by two next year when he hires a third deputy monitor and a second research analyst.

Also, a staff ombudsman who has been working part time will begin working full time. Among other duties, Mitchell said, the ombudsman ""builds relationships with different communities throughout Denver.""

To cover the increased staffing, the monitor's budget will climb to $853,600 in 2013, up from $626,700 this year.

The budget also includes about $15,000 that the Citizen Oversight Board can use to evaluate Mitchell's performance.

The board, made up of seven members, oversees the monitor's office.

Former City Councilwoman Cathy Reynolds, a member of the board, said the staffing increase was sorely needed. ""We actually are going to be fully staffed for the first time in years.""

Among other things, Mitchell and his two deputy monitors sit in on interviews performed by Denver's Internal Affairs Bureau, and Mitchell recommends discipline, up to and including termination, to Manager of Safety Alex Martinez, who heads the departments and the Denver Fire Department.

The additional deputy will make it easier to staff investigations around the clock, including when critical incidents such as police-involved shootings take place, Mitchell said. It will also give him more time to work on ""big-picture policy issues"" and community outreach, he said.

The new analyst will make it possible for the office, which was created in 2005, to do more research on policies and other matters, Reynolds said. ""We are very excited about that.""

Mitchell, 37, wouldn't say what policies he will recommend the departments change — only that he wants to make adjustments to improve services to the community and raise residents' confidence level in law enforcement.

Rosenthal was roundly disliked by police, who said he overstepped the bounds of his office. His annual and quarterly reports often contained analysis and conclusions that rankled cops. Also, discipline being meted out toughened on his watch.

They were particularly angered when Rosenthal and the Citizen Oversight Board clashed with then-Safety Manager Ron Perea, saying publicly that discipline that Perea gave in two excessive-force cases was too light.

In his last report before leaving, Rosenthal accused members of the Internal Affairs Bureau of favoring the officers they investigated and called the bureau incapable of policing cops.

University of Nebraska professor emeritus Samuel Walker,

who has studied policing and citizen oversight for 20 years, said Rosenthal did a good job of monitoring law enforcement misconduct. He called reports that Rosenthal issued making note of problem areas and recommendations to fix them ""impressive.""

Increasing focus on policy can lead to further improvements in policing, said Walker, who has written 11 books on policing, criminal justice history and policy, and civil liberties.

""There have been some agencies that got bogged down in individual cases, and that consumes an enormous amount of time, and you are bogged down in looking at symptoms rather than causes,"" Walker said.

Why make an officer who is following policy the ""fall guy"" when the problem could be training, a poor use of force policy or lousy supervision, Walker said.

Safety Manager Martinez labeled Rosenthal's last report ""nitpicky"" and said none of the points he raised would have changed the outcome of the investigations.

But Police Chief Robert White, who took over the department shortly before Rosenthal left, replaced the head of the Internal Affairs Bureau and the division's staff as part of an ongoing department shake-up.

White said at the time that questions Rosenthal had raised about IAB played a part in his decision to overhaul the bureau.

Nick Rogers, president of the Denver Police Protective Association, said Mitchell has done nothing to upset the union's members since taking over the office in August.

And Mitchell, who grew up in a South Brooklyn neighborhood where crime was no stranger, said he values police protection.

Conversations the two have had have been productive, Rogers said.

Mitchell's style is less confrontational than that of his predecessor, Reynolds said.

""Richard was always just a little-pit-bull-in-a-fighting-match kind of guy. Nick is a little different in that way, a little more measured in his approach,"" said Reynolds. ""It's not a value judgment either way; they are just very different.""

The Washington Post and other liberal ""journalists"" falsely reported that National Security Advisor nominee Michael Flynn spread the #PizzaGate conspiracy that triggered one man to charge a Washington, D.C., pizzeria with a rifle.

""PizzaGate"" is a theory that claims Hillary Clinton and her campaign manager John Podesta operated a child sex ring out of the Comet Ping Pong pizza joint.

The Washington Post claimed retired lieutenant general Michael Flynn spread the conspiracy theory on Twitter:

The restaurant's owner and employees were threatened on social media in the days before the election after fake news stories circulated claiming that then-Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton and her campaign chief were running a child sex ring from the restaurant's back rooms. Even Michael Flynn, a retired general who President-elect Donald Trump has tapped to advise him on national security, shared the stories.

What Michael Flynn was referencing when he tweeted about ""sex crimes w/children"" was the TRUE story that Anthony Weiner — the husband of Clinton aide Huma Abedin — is being investigated for soliciting sex with minors.

Adding to the confusion, General Flynn's son, Michael Flynn Jr., apparently defended PizzaGate in a tweet.

Jordan said the president hasn't done much for gun control advocates but ""Mitt Romney, at the NRA, he really needed to appeal to that audience, because he's not necessarily their first pick.""

258532,False,1024,"Running for mayor as a populist, Manuel Medina has advocated a $15 minimum wage for municipal workers.

He could start with the homeless people he uses for his campaign.

A wealthy resident of The Dominion, Medina apparently has found the local homeless population politically useful. Some he has paid a few dollars to wear his campaign T-shirt, according to Aline Alonzo, who works with homeless ministries.

On separate occasions, two homeless men told Alonzo that Medina himself had given them a campaign shirt, the ministry worker said. One of the men came to her downtown ministry wearing one.

""He said (Medina) had given him $10 and told him to wear his shirt,"" said Alonzo, 49, who asked to be identified by her middle and maiden name. ""This gentleman told me he's been handing them out to the homeless.""

Reached late Wednesday, Medina denied this.

""Why would you say that?"" he said after a long pause. ""The answer is no. The answer is 100 percent no.""

Alonzo asserted the opposite.

""He's exploiting the homeless,"" she said. ""He's giving them a few dollars, which is really just feeding their drug and alcohol habits, and making them human billboards … They think he's a great and wonderful man because he gave them $10 to go buy liquor. If he really wants to help them, he should pay them minimum wage for the day, at least, to wear his shirt.""

These days, Rodney Kidd is working for Medina's campaign for nothing.

""I help Manuel,"" said Kidd, 45, who said he became homeless about a year ago.

I encountered Kidd downtown on Wednesday about 30 minutes after speaking with Alonzo. Looking for homeless Medina adherents, I found him walking near Main Plaza wearing an ""Elect Manuel Medina"" T-shirt.

Kidd said Medina paid him last year for ""digital marketing and messaging,"" although now he is ""volunteering"" for the campaign: ""Once my scope of work is completed, I fully expect to be hired by the campaign to deliver some more tech.""

(After our conversation, he said he had to rush off to ""fix a printer"" at Medina's campaign headquarters.)

Kidd has stayed at Prospect's Courtyard, a section of the downtown homeless campus Haven for Hope that offers food and shelter to the chronically homeless.

""I'm technically still somewhat there,"" Kidd said. ""I lost my apartment, my car dealing with my sister and lies … My fianceé went back to Nebraska with our baby. My sister created a whole smokescreen that created a lot of problems. At that point, where do you go? You have nothing.""

On Monday, Kidd joined Medina at a campaign protest against me on the front steps of the San Antonio Express-News. The candidate had issued a press release summoning media outlets to the raucous demonstration.

With a scrum of supporters shouting ""racist!"" and calling for my termination, Medina railed against a column that questioned whether he has lived continuously in Texas for the past 24 years — as Medina has claimed on his ballot application and on the campaign trail.

Wearing a blue ""Elect Manuel Medina"" cap, Kidd stood behind Medina, shooting video on an iPhone and shouting ""USA! USA!"" as the candidate falsely told the television news cameras that my column had called him ""a Mexican."" (The column noted he became an American citizen in 2009.)

On Wednesday, Kidd was polite. He assured me the protest wasn't his idea and asked how the campaign could improve its communication with me. (I found that bitterly funny.)

Kidd was working for Medina, he said, because the candidate ""tries to represent everybody"" and cares about the homeless.

""Unless the (Prospect's) Courtyard has a model that supports solutions, I'm not going to move forward,"" Kidd said.

Medina told me he wasn't aware that Kidd was homeless.

""Rodney Kidd is a volunteer,"" Medina said. ""Like many volunteers we have on the campaign, I appreciate his support. I don't know the details of his personal life.""

Kidd told me that Medina often asks him out of concern whether he has a place to stay at night.

""Manuel has been nothing but be nice,"" Kidd said. ""There's no doubt in my mind that Manuel would offer me his own house if I pushed the issue.""

Kidd should push at least for a wage.

On the street, he seemed desperate to connect, not unlike others in the homeless community I've covered as a reporter. It's not surprising that a demagogue in a suit has managed to win his confidence, particularly one who once pledged in a ""faith-based platform"" to ""address poverty at its root causes not its symptoms and consequences.""

A beer, brewed in a tesseract, that'll shoot you through the roof --

And if you don't believe me, I've got lots and lots of proof. (final chorus)

Three-Oh-Seven Ale, me lads, Three-Oh-Seven Ale,

The finest drink that any bar has ever had for sale,

It'll lay your whole damn world to waste, it'll make you fit and hale,

It sticks to your mouth like library paste,

With a stronger kick than toxic waste,

There's nothing that you'll ever taste

Like Three-Oh-Seven Ale!

256508,False,1024,"Abstract Utilization of neuropharmaceuticals for central nervous system(CNS) disease is highly limited due to the blood-brain barrier(BBB) which restricts molecules larger than 500Da from reaching the CNS. The development of a reliable method to bypass the BBB would represent an enormous advance in neuropharmacology enabling the use of many potential disease modifying therapies. Previous attempts such as transcranial catheter implantation have proven to be temporary and associated with multiple complications. Here we describe a novel method of creating a semipermeable window in the BBB using purely autologous tissues to allow for high molecular weight(HMW) drug delivery to the CNS. This approach is inspired by recent advances in human endoscopic transnasal skull base surgical techniques and involves engrafting semipermeable nasal mucosa within a surgical defect in the BBB. The mucosal graft thereby creates a permanent transmucosal conduit for drugs to access the CNS. The main objective of this study was to develop a murine model of this technique and use it to evaluate transmucosal permeability for the purpose of direct drug delivery to the brain. Using this model we demonstrate that mucosal grafts allow for the transport of molecules up to 500 kDa directly to the brain in both a time and molecular weight dependent fashion. Markers up to 40 kDa were found within the striatum suggesting a potential role for this technique in the treatment of Parkinson's disease. This proof of principle study demonstrates that mucosal engrafting represents the first permanent and stable method of bypassing the BBB thereby providing a pathway for HMW therapeutics directly into the CNS.

Introduction Neurologic disorders affect more than 20 million patients in the US alone and account for over $400 billion in annual expenditure for both their treatment and chronic care [1], [2]. The paucity of effective neurodegenerative therapies is directly attributable to the presence of the blood-brain barrier(BBB) and blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier(BCSFB). These barriers are composed of densely packed cells with copious intercellular tight junctions(TJ), active efflux pumps, and a trilamellar basement membrane which prevent the absorption of polar or high molecular weight(HMW) molecules larger than 500Da [3]. This results in restriction of up to 98% of all potential neuropharmaceutical agents from reaching the central nervous system(CNS) [3]. Consequently, known charged or macromolecular therapies which may be capable of preventing or even reversing certain neurologic diseases are rendered clinically ineffective due to their inability to cross the BBB. The limitations of the BBB have catalyzed a considerable research effort into ways to circumvent this barrier. Currently described experimental methods such as transcranial catheter placement [4] and the use of protein conjugates [1] may be invasive or require extensive drug manipulation to optimize trans-BBB transport rendering them impractical, morbid, and expensive to scale up for widespread clinical use. Furthermore even if the BBB could be successfully overcome, the majority of these strategies rely on a peripheral delivery route leading to potential systemic toxicity and pulsatile CNS delivery [2]. The evident value of a direct pathway capable of continuous delivery of polar and macromolecular therapies has led to a large body of work seeking to exploit the olfactory mucosa for this purpose.

But for all of this advanced technology, the vision of the U.S. Air Force Special Operations Command gunships can be thwarted by the threatening adversary known as a cloudy sky.

The Air Force has a solution: Launch a small unmanned aircraft from the gunship to drop below the cloud cover and serve as the eyes of the AC-130's crew. Special Operations officials last year spoke publicly about using a drone called the Coyote—the wings of the Coyote unfold as the drone launches from a six-inch-wide tube. A higher-endurance version is in development.

Weapons are getting smarter and drones are getting smaller, and pretty soon it will be hard to tell the difference. ""The main weakness of sUAS [small unmanned aircraft systems] is range,"" says U.S. Air Force Brigadier General Alexus Grynkewich, deputy director for operations at the National Joint Operations and Intelligence Center and coauthor of a recently released Pentagon study called ""Air Superiority 2030 Flight Plan."" ""You need some delivery method to get them close.""

Grynkewich sees the engineering challenge as a series of trade-offs. A heavier engine increases a drone's range, but the airplane that launches it isn't able to carry as many. The amount of sophistication on the sensor adds expense to the drone, which may be lost in battle. And the wingspan is limited by the hardware on the airplane. Despite these complexities, the Air Force sees smart but disposable aircraft as an important solution: Airpower is a game of threat and response. One side makes a powerful radar array, the other creates stealth warplanes that can fly undetected. By the time the new airplane is ready to meet the old threat, a new one has emerged. It's a lot easier, cheaper, and faster, however, to redesign a drone than an entire airplane. ""The idea is to have a tech refresh fielded in months instead of years,"" says Reid Melville, strategy lead for unmanned systems at the Air Force Research Laboratory at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base. ""That way, when we get surprised, we will have the infrastructure in place to make a rapid change.""

Except when it comes to singing The Righteous Brothers songs in bars, this new generation of drones promises to be the perfect wingman. They make no mistakes and have no emotion. And if the situation demands it, they are willing sacrifices. There is one big difference, however: Like soldiers, drones will always deserve gratitude. Unlike soldiers, however, they'll never deserve a funeral.

The Arsenal

Seven of the most promising designs right now.

Miniature Air-Launched Decoy (MALD)

•MALD is a trailblazer. In the mid-1990s DARPA started researching this small jet-engine-powered craft, fired from a warplane's wing, that could fly along GPS waypoints and emit signals to mimic a full-size aircraft. Hidden air-defense systems shoot at MALD and expose themselves to counterattack. After a stutter-step start, the technology caught up with the idea and in 2009 Raytheon delivered the first MALD to the Air Force. Recent upgrades include a carbon-composite fuselage that lightens the airframe. An upcoming datalink ability will enable pilots to reprogram MALD's flight path after launch.

•Status: Currently deployed.

Coyote

•Dropped from an airplane, these disposable drones are launched from a six-inch tube and unfold in flight. They are currently launched from National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration airplanes to study hurricanes. The Air Force special-ops folks have converted them for use on gunships, to aim at targets obscured by clouds.

•Status: Currently deployed.

Air-Launched, Tube-Integrated, Unmanned System (ALTIUS)

Drones such as the Coyote can stay airborne for only an hour. The USAF tactical off-board sensing program wants a drone that can provide continuous surveillance coverage for at least four. So they came up with ALTIUS. It has a state-of-the-art, high-energy-density power system that can withstand harsh environmental conditions, does not pose an explosive hazard, and can be stored for more than six months. It uses a highly efficient, lightweight carbon-composite airframe, and its slender shape is designed to fit in a six- to eight-inch launch tube.

Slovakia is no major cycling nation but they have one of the very best riders in their ranks. Hence, it is no surprise that the Slovakian road race championships have been dominated by Peter Sagan in the last few years and this year was no exception.

With just his brother Juraj at his side, Sagan faced a potentially difficult situation as he was up against much larger contingents from smaller teams. However, he proved to be in a class of his own in the 192km race in Slavkov and insted of putting all his eggs into the sprint basket, he went on the attack.

The race was held in conjunction with the Czech championships and so both Zdenek Stybar and Sagan were winners when they escaped in the finale. The duo arrived together at the finish and Sagan could cross the line to take his fourth consecutive title.

As expected, the race developed into a battle with Peter Velits who is the other major Slovakian rider. The former Vuelta podium finisher took second while Martin Mahdar completed the podium.

Sagan will first wear the jersey when he lines up for the Tour de France on Saturday.

256291,True,593,"&""Did you encourage them to make up the made up thing to their own advantage?"" That's how one Twitter correspondent paraphrased a question to the Deputy Governor of the Bank. The LIBOR scandal has exposed the institutions and culture of the City to popular scrutiny as never before. The population is reacting with justified incredulity to the absurdity it is finding.

LIBOR submissions from Barclays and everyone else were based not on the rate at which they would lend, not on what they actually had to pay to borrow, but on what they said they thought they might have to pay. On the face of it, that is the flakiest of the three possible metrics. What system of financial regulation could cope with the inherent moral hazard? And even those virtuous souls who would never consider shading LIBOR to their advantage couldn't replicate the market: if they could, they'd have retired rich already.


There are two kinds of market manipulation. There are those where players try to manipulate markets for their individual advantage outside the rules, as with LIBOR, and those where the authorities try to manipulate the whole financial universe to meet some well-intentioned goal. The former is occasional and may have gigantic repercussions. The second has long been systematic policy: we now see it could have catastrophic consequences for our social system.

We know we're recovering from a debt crisis but why did people borrow so much and save so little? The broad measure of the money supply trebled between 1997 and 2010 but the household savings ratio fell from almost 10% in 1997 to just 2% by 2008. Where did all that new money come from?

Central banks held down interest rates to stimulate economies with new credit, to push impending corrections out of sight. Those artificially low interest rates discouraged saving and encouraged borrowing but banks can extend credit into existence to cover the gap. With moral hazard endemic, banks loaned recklessly, using derivatives to book unrealised cash flows as profit up front. Some individuals went home unjustly rich and politicians won elections as the system over-extended itself.

There is never a good moment for a correction, so when the time came, the cycle repeated – terminally. And now the tool is QE.

The really important question today is not whether the Bank of England encouraged manipulation of credit markets by self-interested rogues but why we tolerate systematic credit market manipulation by the central banks as a matter of policy: nowhere else in the economic system would we accept explicit planning of the price and quantity of a vital commodity. If it worked, we'd all be communists.

The LIBOR scandal shows that everyone knows prices should be set by markets. It's time to look again at the central banks, for those particular emperors have no clothes. Meanwhile, look out for the next controversy when it becomes apparent how banks gamed slack IFRS accounting standards using derivatives to create fake profits and capital…",0.7710780763888854,0.7710780763888854,0.0,0.0

The brief setup for other non-viewers: Maddie Hayward (played by Maura Tierney) is running for Governor against Peter Florrick (Chris Noth) and she used to be friends with Florrick's wife Alicia (Julianna Margulies).

In the scene below (beginning at the 31:47 mark), a reporter confronts Hayward about a video showing her not bowing her head during a prayer:

Reporter: Ms. Hayward, how do you respond to the controversy over your actions at last week's benediction? Maddie Hayward: My actions… you mean the video on the Web of me not bowing? Reporter: Yes. During prayer. There's been some chatter about your insensitivity. Hayward: Well, I apologize if it, uh, seemed insensitive. I was just trying to avoid being hypocritical. I am an atheist. Reporter: Really? Don't you worry about how that'll play in a state where only 15% call themselves non-religious? Hayward: I worry about everything. [Nervous laughter] But I am who I am and I don't think you should run away from that. Let's just let the voters decide. Reporter: And what about you, Mr. State's Attorney? Peter Florrick: I respect Maddie's point of view. Reporter: But you don't share it. Peter Florrick: Well, it's different. I was in prison. Belief means a great deal there. In fact, sometimes, it was the only thing we had. Reporter: And your wife? Peter Florrick: Oh, well, I think my wife can speak for herself. Alicia Florrick: I'm an atheist. [Smile.]

I don't think Florrick's campaign manager's going to be happy about that admission from Alicia…

But how awesome is it to see the main character of a popular TV show out herself as an atheist? And what about her husband's opponent also admitting that? And what about neither woman acting like it's a horrible thing?!

he call came in around 5 on a tepid January night in Gainesville, Florida. Officer Bobby White was patrolling an area nearby when he heard the complaint; kids were playing basketball too loudly in street. The officer on duty for that district was on another call, so White picked it up.

Video from White's dashboard camera shows him pull onto NW 21st Street, where a couple of teenage boys were shooting a basketball on a single hoop over the street.

As his patrol car came to a stop, the boys quit playing. White got out of his car and approached them.

A scene as old and terrifying as the list of headlines that preceded it -- Trayvon Martin, Freddie Gray and others -- but what happened next did not befit the precedent.

""I knew how I wasn't going to react,"" White said. ""I knew I wasn't going to come here and make the kids stop playing basketball.""

There was no confusion. No chaos. Just more basketball.

""Can you believe someone called in a noise complaint about kids playing basketball in the street?"" White asked as he approached 17-year-old Aahtrell Johnson.

Officer White quickly smiled -- ""Obviously, I ain't got no problem with it.""

Then he and the boys started playing together. It began small, with the two kids who were there when he originally pulled up. But as the minutes passed, more kept showing up.

There were the several from inside Tyree Thomas' house -- the hoop stood in his front yard. ""My friend came in and said the police was outside,"" Tyree explained, ""so we went outside to see what they did. Turns out they did nothing wrong.""

By the time White left, there were eight kids playing. The whole event took about 10 minutes.

""Any time I have a chance, even when I'm not on active duty, to get out and interact with kids in the community, I do so,"" he said.

A few days after the encounter, officer Ben Tobias, the public information officer for the Gainesville Police Department, posted White's dashboard camera footage online. Since then, it has received more than 17 million views on the department's Facebook page alone.

Overnight, White became the ""Basketball Cop,"" and the hashtag #HoopsNotCrime began to trend.

People also began donating basketballs and hoops. The Orlando Magic invited the group of boys to come to a basketball game and sent their bus to pick them up. Rock sporting apparel sent basketballs. The mayor of Gainesville invited them to his house. The Florida Gators gave them tickets to one of their games.

They've also had a few high-profile drop-ins. Shaquille O'Neal came to Gainesville after he heard the story and played basketball with the kids. The Harlem Globetrotters came to play and gave them game tickets.

""The response has been incredible,"" White said. He was even able to get a couple of local businesses to donate time and supplies to build a permanent basketball court in Tyree's backyard. The boys would no longer have to play in the street.

""I feel safe,"" Antwan Thompson said. ""Like this is my home.""

NEW DELHI — The death toll from the collapse of a building near Mumbai rose to at least 72 people on Saturday, two days after the disaster that underscored the prevalence of illegal and shoddy construction ending in disaster.

Rescuers worked into Saturday pulling bodies from the rubble in Thane. The Associated Press reported one women was pulled from the rubble after 36 hours.


Photo

The high death toll was partly a reflection of how construction workers and their families often live in crude shacks at construction sites, exposing women and children to significant risks.

""Illegal construction is a major problem in the Thane area,"" said Sandeep Malvi, public relations officer of Thane Municipal Corporation. ""Each time we demolish a building, someone builds again. We demolish it, and they build.""

The price of land in many Indian cities has grown so high that contractors routinely build on public property – sometimes after bribing public officials. If enough buildings are built in a particular area and enough time passes, these makeshift settlements become politically impossible to demolish.

The collapsed building in Thane was built on protected forest land, according to Mr. Malvi. And because of the uncertainty surrounding the fate of such buildings, the quality of the construction is often very poor.

""Because these buildings come up so quickly, the quality is always very bad,"" Mr. Malvi said.

Photo

Local police officials have filed murder charges against the builders, who have yet to be found.

Building collapses aren't unusual in India because of unsafe and illegal constructions tacked onto structures. In 2010, a five-story tenement collapsed in New Delhi, killing at least 64 people, mostly migrant workers.

A government study, published in 1998, noted that, ""The number of unsafe buildings is increasing every day.""

The problem is not a lack of construction standards, just an indifference to them, the study concluded.

But even high-quality construction projects defy contracting norms that are enforced in places like the United States. For instance, New Delhi bans large cement trucks from entering much of the city during the day. The result is that concrete for even very large homes is often made in a batch process on site, which can result in substandard buildings with significant structural flaws.

Indian cities are being flooded with migrants from rural areas for which few cities are providing any kind of planning or infrastructure. The result is vast slums and illegal construction. A recent survey found that more than 17 percent of Indian households live in slums that are considered unlivable by the Indian government. In greater Mumbai, the share of people living in such slums is 41 percent.

When such a large share of the population lives in such destitute circumstances, illegal construction — even with its inherent risks — becomes a welcome alternative for millions of people.

Created by Apocalypse's Horseman Sinister from genetic material taken from the mutant heroes Cyclops and Jean Grey of his reality, Nate ultimately learned that his purpose was to destroy Apocalypse. After the death of his surrogate father Forge, Nate traveled to Apocalypse's Citadel and battled Holocaust, another of Apocalypse's Horsemen. In an attempt to breach Holocaust's armor, Nate stabbed him with a shard of the M'Krann Crystal, causing them both to be transported to the Earth-616, the mainstream reality.

Nate's subconscious need for companionship created a physical body for the Red Queen of Earth-998, posing as the dissipated essence of Madelyne Pryor, the deceased clone of Jean Grey. Nate and Madelyne became fast friends, journeying through Europe until Pryor left to join the newly reformed Hellfire Club. Nate subsequently encountered the evil Dark Beast, a fellow refugee from his own time, who informed Nate that his vast powers were burning out his young body and that he would die before he turned 21.

After this revelation, Professor Charles Xavier, the telepathic founder of the X-Men, probed Nate's mind. Sensing the evil in Xavier that would eventually become the powerful psionic entity Onslaught, Nate lashed out with his powers and pulled Xavier's psyche from the astral plane. This incident allowed Onslaught to escape Xavier's mind, and it captured Nate, Xavier, and Franklin Richards, the mutant son of Reed and Sue Richards of the world-famous Fantastic Four. Onslaught intended to use Nate's power to fuel his plans to turn the human race into a collective consciousness, but was defeated by the combined might of America's costumed champions.

Eventually, Nate realized the full extent of his powers and became a modern-day mutant shaman. To save humanity from destruction by an alien Harvester, Nate sacrificed himself to merge his energies with the alien's and, through the conduit it had forged with the world, into every being on the planet, thus rendering the world's energy useless to the Harvester's race.

During his time spent in the mainstream reality, Nate had formed friendships with other heroes such as Spider-Man as well as opposing some of the worst villains known to man like the evil Abomination and the Purple Man.

255301,True,513,"Ulster's Democratic Unionist Party, which is expected to prop up Theresa May's minority government over the coming months, has spurned Tory Remainers who hoped they would force the Prime Minister to ask the EU for a so-called 'Soft Brexit'.

According to ITV's Robert Peston, a source within the DUP ""was very keen to be quoted"" as saying that his party ""completely backs [May's] vision of Brexit"" – and not that of her Chancellor of the Exchequer, Philip Hammond.

While both May and Hammond campaigned for a Remain vote during the EU referendum, the Prime Minister has subsequently endorsed what supporters call a ""Clean Brexit"", taking Britain out of the bloc's Single Market and its associated Free Movement regime, as well as the Customs Union which precludes member-states from conducting an independent trade policy.

Remain diehards, who want a 'Soft Brexit' in which Britain would remain party to the Single Market and Customs Union in order to maintain the closest possible links to the European Union, term this a ""Hard"" or ""Extreme"" Brexit.

Hammond's team at HM Treasury – the engine room of the Remain campaign's 'Project Fear' under his predecessor George Osborne – are said to have entered ""street-fighting mode"" as he canvasses support for such a deal.

DUP backs Theresa May's vision of Brexit, not Philip Hammond's – ITV News https://t.co/am8htKLfJD — Robert Peston (@Peston) June 15, 2017

If Peston's source is reliable, however, it seems the 'Soft Brexit' faction have lost crucial leverage. It had been claimed that the DUP, which is keen to see a minimum of economic friction between Ulster and the Irish Republic after Brexit, would at least back their calls for Britain to stay in the Customs Union.

The ITV presenter has been led to believe that the DUP is ""100 per cent committed to the UK leaving the Single Market AND the Customs Union"" – having preferred to use its bargaining power to press for plans to introduce means-testing for the winter fuel allowance and scrap the pensions triple lock to be dropped.

Leavers within the Government are predicting ferocious resistance to Brexit from without the Cabinet as well as within, with one minister predicting ""utterly bitter, trench warfare"" as opposition politicians and Tory rebels ""fight us line by line, in committees, on the floor and in the Lords, for months and months on end.""",0.6724904103957381,0.6724904103957381,0.0,0.0
259734,False,1024,"Harvey Weinstein and I at The Hotel Du Cap

I was only 23 when I was 'Harveyed'. It was 1997. I was a street smart kid with a tougher skin than most, and I came out of my experience with Weinstein physically unscathed, but that doesn't make the story less shocking or emotionally jarring.

As a model I was used to predatory men and had become adept at brushing off unwanted advances and putting creepy perverts in their place. I had protected other, younger models from flashers and gropers, and had even scared away a knife wielding attacker on the Paris Metro by laughing in his face. He didn't know it was a nervous reaction and probably thought I was crazier than he. But, all in all, I was still a naive girl from New Zealand, and no matter how tough I thought I was, I was completely out of my depth and very trusting.

I met Harvey Weinstein in Cannes at the Film Festival. We were seated next to each other at a fancy dinner. I didn't catch his name and assumed I was talking to another hungry producer trying to sell a little movie to the big wigs. Feeling sorry for him, I went out of my way to be entertaining and nice. It wasn't until later in the meal that I asked the name of his production company.

""Miramax.""

I laughed and told Harvey that we had a friend in common. Miramax had recently released the Oscar winning film 'The Piano' made by a family friend, Jane Campion. I told Harvey that Jane felt like a pseudo god-mother to me and related a story of how, when I was an angry teenager in a fight with my mom, she had given me a note that read""If you ever need to run away…"" and made me feel like I had an ally.

With a dear mutual friend in common I felt safe with Harvey. The night was young and so was I. After dinner our large group, which included my Italian modelling agent, a few rich douchebags, some decorative models, and Harvey's entourage, rolled out into the Cannes night. Black town cars and gleaming limos took us to various parties where we glittered and shone like everyone else.

Harvey and his assistant , Ben Silverman, never left my side.

It was fun. The last time I'd been in the South of France was in 1990. I had watched helplessly as Helena Christensen vomited all over the bathroom at Jimmy's after doing too much blow with Michael Hutchence and Jacques Chirac, who was in between his various Presidencies of France. In 1990 I was 16. Now, at 23 I was pretty jaded. Celebrities and their antics were old news. I could hold my own.

Around midnight we ended up at a beautiful outdoor event at a mansion somewhere in a residential part of Cannes. Everyone was there, and everyone was fabulous. I saw Bono across the room. He yelled ""Dolphin Girl!"" and waved. I explained to Harvey that this wasn't a nickname that had anything to do with the popular sex toy, but a name I earned after a particularly weird night in Sydney, and a 3am skinny dipping adventure that scared the crap out of U2's bodyguards.

In retrospect I was putting on a tempting show. I didn't intend to titillate Mr Weinstein - I had no intention of leading him on. I felt safe in his company to be myself, and at no time in the evening did I feel anything but platonic energy from him.

Shortly after midnight my crew made moves to leave. We were staying on a large yacht moored in the bay and required water taxis to get us back out to it. Harvey and Ben offered us their cars and herded us towards the exit. My group was ushered into one car and I was somehow separated from them and told to get into another car with Harvey and his two friends. Stupidly, I obliged. I was told we were all going to the same place.

To this day I do not know if my Italian agent was in on the ruse. My instincts tell me he was.

We started driving. The 5 minute drive to the waterfront was taking longer and I asked where we were headed.

""Change of plans! We're all meeting at the Du Cap for one more drink.""

It's a 30 minute drive to the Du Cap and it was close to 1am when we got there. We headed upstairs to Harvey's room and opened another bottle of champagne while we waited for the gang to arrive.

But the gang never arrived.

After a few minutes a couple of the guys made motions to leave temporarily to make calls. The energy shifted and I became very uncomfortable. I turned to Ben and asked him to please get in touch with my friends immediately and find out where they were. Ben said he would go downstairs and see if",0.0,0.8155903725086578,-1.7000000000000002,0.0
258936,False,1024,"My visit

My Editor in Chief Will Byrd and I headed to New Jersey Motorsports Park to drive a few of their cars. You may have seen Will's article of him driving a Lamborghini Huracan LP 610-4 then being driven in the same car by Mikey Taylor, who is an IMSA driver. If you haven't check it out here. I was there to drive a Nissan GT-R and do something interesting in a Ferrari 458. I do not want to give to many details about the 458 session yet, but let's just say records were broken.

When we arrived at the track, we attended the normal informative pre-track classroom session which was run by Stu Warner. We met our two instructors who would be our track liaisons for the day, Mikey Taylor and Joey Muzio, with them we chatted about our track experience so they got an idea of what we can do before we got in the cars. We were then put in the Mitsubishi Evo pace car to get an idea of the track layout before we hopped in our rides.

In between our ""Xperiences"" we had the time to chat with much of Xtreme Xperience's staff and I can say these are car people. You could tell they honestly wanted to discuss cars. I got the vibe of a cars & coffee and less than a business.

Eventually, it came time for both Will and I to drive our cars. Will and I both drove our cars on track at the same time hitting over 130 mph in each. Chasing a Lamborghini Huracan in a Nissan GT-R is surely recorded to my personal life highlight reel.

What has changed since last time?

I have an interesting view of Xtreme Xperience. I have been attending their track events long before I did the writing about cars thing. I have been driving with them since 2014.

It has been like watching a small company grow to a power house. When I first road with them they made significant leaps from 2014 to 2015. Now from 2015 to 2016 they did not stop their progress.

In 2016, Xtreme Xperience added a permanent program location in New Orleans at NOLA Motorsports Park. This location is open all year and includes four of the supercars from their fleet: Ferrari 458 Italia, Lamborghini LP560-4, Porsche GT3, and Nissan GT-R.

Their program as a whole every year adds new cars to their fleet while removing underperforming cars. In 2016, Xtreme Xperience brought back the Ferrari F430 which has been absent since 2014, more Lamborghini Huracan's and Porsche 911 GT3's at each event to keep up with demand, as well as adding the McLaren 570S to their fleet. Certain tracks feature special cars such as a Lamborghini Gallardo LP 580-2, Lotus Evora S, and the Nissan GT-R Track Edition. From 2015 to 2016, Xtreme Xperience dropped the Audi R8 and the Chevrolet Corvette.

Cars are obviously the focal point, but there are plenty of other positive business changes that effect the customer. They have added more Mitsubishi Evo's for their thrill ride/pace car experience and a brand new HD video system featuring two cameras, one where you are going and a cabin camera so you can prove to your friends you really did spank that exotic on the track. You can export your track video with graphic track map overlay, track position, and additional lap information.

Track logistical changes have also been made. They have optimized the classroom instruction with new graphics and more concise information and they have increased the run groups to 2 groups. One group drives, while the other waits in the pit. I appreciated this change because before doing this car writing thing the first time I sat in a Ferrari on track went a little like: ""OMGGGGGGGG!!! A Ferrari!!!!, wait how do I drive a car again?"" You have so much excitement for the car and now you get guaranteed ""tinker with time"" to touch all over it. Maybe caress the Alcantara steering wheel on the Porsche 911 GT3 or maybe flip the Manettino dial on the Ferrari 458 between Sport, Race, and Wet, while parked of course.

Suggestions if it is your first time?

Talk with and respond to instructors and any Xtreme Xperience employee – They are all car people. If the instructor asks what your driving level is answer with more than one word answers. The more driving information you convey to the instructors the more they can get out of you on the track. For example, with my instructors I talked what I have driven on the track, how many times I have been on track, even mentioned the fact that I daily a dual clutch transmission just so he could get an idea of my experience. I also conveyed what I wanted to achieve on track, I simply said",0.5051210180348293,0.7051210180348293,-0.2,0.0

Britain and the United States said on Sunday they were considering imposing additional sanctions on Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and his supporters for their actions in Syria's war.

Ryabkov was in the lower house of parliament discussing legislation related to the suspension of a treaty with Washington on cleaning up weapons-grade plutonium, something President Vladimir Putin suspended this month.

The lower house of the Russian parliament approved President Vladimir Putin's decree on suspending a plutonium accord with the United States, Russian news agencies reported.

The agreement was concluded in 2000 and bound the two sides to dispose of surplus plutonium originally intended for use in nuclear weapons.

256896,False,1024,"The team of Bulgarian archaeologist Elena Bozhinova has discovered a stone cast for the casting of metal spear tips from the Antiquity period during rescue excavations in the Old Town of the southern city of Plovdiv.

Archaeologist Elena Bozhinova and her team from the Plovdiv Museum of Archaeology are wrapping up the rescue excavations of a plot formerly occupied by a home on the Saborna Str. in the famous Old Town Architectural and Historical Preserve.

The 100-year-old house occupying the property was torn down several months ago by the local authorities because it was decided that it posed a public safety hazard, reports local news site Pod Tepeto.

The rescue excavations of the plot, however, are now yielding interesting archaeological discoveries such as the partially preserved stone cast designed for casting bronze spear tips. This is the first discovery of spear tip casting instrument in Southern Bulgaria.

Archaeologist Elena Bozhinova has explained that the stone cast for the production of spear tips originally consisted of two parts which fit perfectly after they were tied together with a rope.

Once they were tied together, melted bronze was poured into the opening of the cast in order to produce a spear tip.

Other Antiquity finds discovered by Bozhinova's team include a wide range of ceramic vessels and several fragments from inscriptions as well as well preserved bone needles similar to modern-day hairpins, which were used by the ancient women as accessories and decorations. The Plovdiv archaeologists have also found rammers from the 4th century AD.

Unfortunately, the site's archaeological layers from the Antiquity have been found to be rather damaged because the plot was inhabited during the period of the Ottoman Empire.

Background Infonotes:

The history of today's Bulgarian city of Plovdiv began on the ancient hill of Nebet Tepe (""tepe"" is the Turkish word for ""hill""), one of the seven historic hills where it was founded and developed in prehistoric and ancient times. The hills, or ""tepeta"", are still known today by their Turkish names from the Ottoman period. Out of all of them, Nebet Tepe has the earliest traces of civilized life dating back to the 6th millennium BC, which makes Plovdiv 8,000 years old, and allegedly the oldest city in Europe. Around 1200 BC, the prehistoric settlement on Nebet Tepe was transformed into the Ancient Thracian city of Eumolpia, also known as Pulpudeva, inhabited by the powerful Ancient Thracian tribe Bessi. During the Early Antiquity period Eumolpia / Pulpudeva grew to encompass the two nearby hills (Dzhambaz Tepe and Taxim Tepe known together with Nebet Tepe as ""The Three Hills"") as well, with the oldest settlement on Nebet Tepe becoming the citadel of the city acropolis.

In 342 BC, the Thracian city of Eumolpia / Pulpudeva was conquered by King Philip II of Macedon renaming the city to Philippopolis. Philippopolis developed further as a major urban center during the Hellenistic period after the collapse of Alexander the Great's Empire. In the 1st century AD, more precisely in 46 AD, Ancient Thrace was annexed by the Roman Empire making Philippopolis the major city in the Ancient Roman province of Thrace. This is the period when the city expanded further into the plain around The Three Hills. Because of the large scale public construction works during the period of Ancient Rome's Flavian Dynasty (69-96 AD, including Emperor Vespasian (r. 69-79 AD), Emperor Titus (r. 79-81 AD), Emperor Domitian (r. 81-96 AD)), Plovdiv was also known as Flavia Philippopolis. Later emerging as a major Early Byzantine city, Plovdiv was conquered for the First Bulgarian Empire (632/680 – 1018 AD) by Khan (or Kanas) Krum (r. 803-814 AD) in 812 AD but was permanently incorporated into Bulgaria under Khan (or Kanas) Malamir (r. 831-836 AD) in 834 AD. In Old Bulgarian (also known today as Church Slavonic), the city's name was recorded as Papaldin, Paldin, and Pladin, and later Plavdiv from which today's name Plovdiv originated. The Nebet Tepe fortress continued to be an important part of the city's fortifications until the 14th century when the Second Bulgarian Empire (1185-1396 AD) was conquered by the Ottoman Turks. During the period the Ottoman yoke (1396-1878/1912) when Bulgaria was part of the Ottoman Empire, Plovdiv was called Filibe in Turkish.

If you experienced a bad outcome from LASIK with associated depression or thoughts of suicide, please file a MedWatch report with the FDA online. Alternatively, you may call FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 to report by telephone, download the paper form and either fax it to 1-800-FDA-0178 or mail it to the address shown at the bottom of page 3, or download the MedWatcher Mobile App for reporting LASIK problems to the FDA using a smart phone or tablet.

ARE YOU CONSIDERING LASIK OR ANOTHER FORM OF VISION CORRECTION SURGERY? Please consider this. There have been several Lasik-related suicides and countless anecdotal reports of Lasik-related depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress. In 2008, the FDA called a special public hearing on Lasik after injured Lasik patients complained to the agency. In the weeks leading up to the hearing, the media reported stories of Lasik-related suicides and poor outcomes. At the hearing, leading Lasik surgeons, in a concerted effort to protect the public perception of Lasik, lined up to testify that Lasik cannot not lead to depression or suicide. The Lasik industry even hired a psychiatrist, Jennifer Morse, MD, to testify that patients who are depressed after Lasik were already depressed before Lasik, and that there is no scientific evidence of any direct link between Lasik and depression or suicide. Morse was even quoted in an October, 2008 issue of EyeWorld magazine saying that unhappy Lasik patients have good Lasik results but defective brains (David Laber. Depressed patients can struggle coping with post-Lasik. EyeWorld. October 2008.). Physicians in every other medical specialty must acknowledge and address surgical complications or face lawsuits, discipline by state medical boards, and loss of medical license. In the field of Lasik, surgeons readily lie to protect themselves, their colleagues, and the Lasik gravy train. Below is a link to a February, 2016 review of the body of medical literature on surgical complications (all types of surgery) and their impact on patients' psychosocial well-being. The conclusion states, ""Surgical complications appear to be a significant and often long-term predictor of patient postoperative psychosocial outcomes. The results highlight the importance of attending to patients' psychological needs in the aftermath of surgical complications."" Be warned, if you experience problems after laser eye surgery, your surgeon will almost certainly downplay or dismiss your concerns. If you continue to complain, you will likely be met with animosity and eventual abandonment. Because Lasik is completely unnecessary and carries significant risk to a vital sensory organ, the Lasik industry will do whatever is necessary to conceal the problems. Please read the following article and consider the psychological toll that surgical complications take on patients. Lasik is no different. Are you willing to accept this hidden risk of Lasik?

255994,True,698,"Several major civil-rights organizations, including the NAACP and the ACLU, are expressing outrage that President-elect Donald Trump has picked Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions to be the next attorney general of the United States.

A statement from the NAACP Legal Defense Fund blasted Sessions' ""decades-long record—from his early days as a prosecutor to his present role as a senator—of opposing civil rights and equality."" President and Director-Counsel Sherrilyn Ifill wrote, ""It is unimaginable that he could be entrusted to serve as the chief law-enforcement officer for this nation's civil-rights laws. This is yet another signal from the incoming administration that it is not only prepared to turn its back on equality; it is actively working to continue to sow division and undo decades of progress.""

The selection followed a meeting between Trump and Sessions on Wednesday, in which Trump said he was ""unbelievably impressed"" with Sessions. The senator, to say the least, is a controversial choice to run the Justice Department, as he has been publicly accused of racially charged comments and actions as far back as the 1980s.

""The last person women and families need in this job is someone who has repeatedly given a pass to individuals who commit acts of violence against abortion clinics, doesn't take sexual assault seriously, and was determined to be too racist by a GOP-led Senate to become a federal judge,"" NARAL Pro-Choice America President Ilyse Hogue said in a statement Friday. ""But that's who Jeff Sessions is. His record of misogyny and racism makes him unfit to be the country's top lawyer. The American people deserve far better, but with Donald Trump at the helm, we know we won't get it.""

Hogue specifically blasted Sessions' ""long anti-choice record,"" as well as his defense of Trump's notorious ""grab them by the pussy"" moment.

ACLU Executive Director Anthony D. Romero chimed in Friday with his own statement about Trump's choice. ""As a matter of organizational policy, the American Civil Liberties Union does not take a position supporting or opposing presidential or judicial nominations,"" the statement read.

""We do, however, educate the American people and the Congress about nominees' records and past positions."" Sessions has, Romero said, ""called the ACLU un-American and communist, assertions we flatly reject."" Romero continued, ""His positions on LGBT rights, capital punishment, abortion rights, and presidential authority in times of war have been contested by the ACLU and other civil-rights organizations. As the nation's highest-ranking law enforcement official, the attorney general is charged with protecting the rights of all Americans.""

U.S. Rep. Luis V. Gutiérrez, of Illinois, issued his own passionate denouncement that caught wind on Twitter. ""If you have nostalgia for the days when blacks kept quiet, gays were in the closet, immigrants were invisible and women stayed in the kitchen, Senator Jefferson Beauregard Sessions is your man,"" he wrote.

""No senator has fought harder against the hopes and aspirations of Latinos, immigrants, and people of color than Sen. Sessions,"" the congressman added. ""He is a staunch opponent of legal immigration and someone who has blocked every effort to improve, modernize, and humanize our immigration system, which is two or three decades out-of-date.""

This SPL chart compares a single 30x30x27 inch 70 pound Tuba 30 loaded with an Eminence Delta 12 LF driver to the Cerwin-Vega L36, which is 30% larger and weighs twice as much.

But don't just go by a chart. Here's what builder Nick Birkby has to say about his T30s:

I built two full size T30's using JBL 2206 drivers. The sound from these cabs is nothing short of STUNNING! The bass has real authority and is fast and dynamic! Overall, the cabs have a way of reproducing bass in a very effortless manner, even with with heavy DJ/ dance material. Such a change from that 'struggling woofer' sound you get from typical 2x15 cabs. The waveform of the bass is 'tactile' if thats the right word. You can almost sense the momentum the wave builds up while travelling the length of the horn. Like a friggin e xpress train when it emerges! Yes I am waxing a bit lyrical here, but the satisfaction of firing these up was unique treat! Construction was relatively easy for me using very limited tools. I built the second much faster than the first, and used a handheld circular saw for the internal cuts, the rest being cut to size by the timber guys. The sheer presence and authority of these cabs outweighs any hauling gripes. Big thanks to Bill and the excellent Forum resource!

Build options abound with the T30. They may be built from 16 to 30 inches wide, loaded with one or two ten or twelve inch drivers. Build costs start from about $180 for a 16 incher loaded with an Eminence BP102.

Tuba 45

The T45 is an oblong version of the T30. It uses the same drivers and has similar response to the T30, but its side profile measures 24 by 45 inches. Loaded with a ten inch driver it may be built as narrow as 13 inches, loaded with a twelve as narrow as 15 inches. The design is 'end firing', just like the T60, so it may placed laid down, or stood up on end where floor space is tight.

Construction Degree of Difficulty: 5

Performance Quotient: 10

Suggested Audience Size, using 16 inch wide cabs:

2 cabs to 300; 4 cabs 250-600; 6 cabs 500-1,000; 8 cabs 800-2,000

Wider cabs and dual driver cabs will handle larger audiences.

255086,True,777,"NEW DELHI: Here's something ayurveda gurus like Charak and Susrutha may not have imagined. Modern ayurvedacharayas, homoeopaths and other Ayush doctors may soon be allowed to conduct non-invasive abortions. The health ministry has worked out changes to the Medical Termination of Pregnancy (MTP) Amendment Bill. The revised bill proposes to allow Ayush doctors to conduct non-invasive procedures on women seeking to terminate pregnancy. The draft bill will soon be sent to the Cabinet.

""We have made revisions to the earlier draft and proposed that Ayush doctors who are registered healthcare specialists be allowed to carry out non-invasive procedure, which would mean prescribing medicines etc,"" a senior health ministry official told TOI.

Another key amendment seeks to increase the period for abortion to 24 weeks from the present 20 weeks. The government's proposal, originally formulated taking a cue from a study conducted by Population Council, is aimed at increasing access to safe abortion by expanding the number of healthcare providers. Estimates show around 7 million abortions are conducted in India every year and over 50% of them are said to be illegal.

Initially, the government had decided to allow midwives and Ayush doctors to do even invasive procedures for abortion, but dropped it following mounting objections from allopathic practitioners, particularly Indian Medical Association (IMA) and Federation of Obstetric and Gynaecological Societies of India (FOGSI). IMA, a pan India voluntary organization with a membership of 2.5 lakh allopathic practitioners, said even the latest move can put patients at risk as well as allow unethical practices and sex selective abortions.

""MTP is a procedure meant to be conducted by an allopathic doctor only. It is not possible to allow restricted practice. How will the government monitor whether a person is conducting abortion through medicine or doing invasive procedures,"" says IMA secretary general Dr KK Aggarwal. According to Dr Aggarwal, abortions by a non-MBBS doctor can lead to critical medical conditions arising out of excessive bleeding or incomplete abortions, which can be difficult to handle.

Ministry officials say FOGSI members were part of the consultations and initially supported the amendments. However, FOGSI has maintained that it changed its position after a thorough discussion. ""Expanding the number and type of providers able to legally perform abortion services, including manual vacuum aspiration (MVA) and medical abortion (MA), could greatly expand women's access to safe abortion and save many lives each year,"" Population Council said in a note on the issue.

The World Health Organisation (WHO) also seems to endorse the government's proposal. A technical and policy guidance for health systems by WHO released in 2012 states, ""Abortion care can be safely provided by any properly trained health-care provider, including mid-level providers....(e.g. midwives, nurse practitioners, clinical officers, physician assistants, family welfare visitors, and others) who are trained to provide basic clinical procedures related to reproductive health...""

TOI

Traditionally, mid-wives have played a key role in catering to urgent medical needs, especially attending to pregnant women for child delivery or even for abortion, in rural areas and villages that lacked medical facilities. Though with time government health centres and private players reached many such villages, mid-wives continue to exist and attend to many emergencies even today. The government's proposal to involve Ayush doctors has also found support from the women and child development ministry, National Commission for Women and other women's groups.

255448,True,861,"Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker is fond of pointing out that he was voted into office based on his promise to take on state employee union collective bargaining rights so that he could get on with balancing the state's budget.

Indeed, shortly after introducing his controversial 'beat down' of collective bargaining in the Badger State, Walker claimed that nobody should have been surprised by his actions because he had campaigned on the issue.

We introduced a measure last week, a measure I ran on during the campaign, a measure I talked about in November during the transition, a measure I talked about in December when we fought off the employee contracts, an idea I talked about in the inauguration, an idea I talked about in the state of the state. If anyone doesn't know what's coming, they've been asleep for the past two years. Via Milwaukee Journal Sentinel

While there have been continuing efforts to show that Scott Walker never did reveal his plans for collective bargaining in the state during the campaign, definitive proof has now emerged via a video tape of Candidate Walker being interviewed by the editorial board of the Oshkosh Northwestern— just one week before the election.

The smoking gun video was recently unearthed by Judd Lounsbury, and published on his Uppity Wisconsin blog, and reveals that Scott Walker was singing quite a different tune before winning his gubernatorial race. While you can watch the entire video at the Uppity Wisconsin website—and I recommend you do so—here is the relevant dialogue which takes place at 7:50 into the conversation -

Editorial Board Member: Before, we were talking about state employees contributing to their plan, paying their share of the pension plan. Collective bargaining come into that? Walker: Yep (nodding yes) Editorial Board Member: How do you get that negotiated and accepted by the state employee unions? Walker: You still have to negotiate it. I did that at the county as well.

Walker went on to indicate that he was willing to work with the unions, pointing out that he had used furloughs as a bargaining tool when negotiating with unions as Milwaukee County Executive and that he would ""approach a similar strategy for the state."" Walker further noted that he was open to compromise and that if the unions had ideas as to how to save money, he would be willing to explore what they might have to say.

Sounds reasonable to me—except that it turns out that Governor Walker had no interest whatsoever in what the unions had to say. In fact, we know that the state employees' unions attempted to agree with Walker's proposals to modify their collective bargaining agreements before the Governor introduced his legislation placing severe limits on collective bargaining.

So, Governor Walker fibbed. The question now is will Wisconsin voters care?

While it seems difficult to ignore that Walker very much sought to mislead Wisconsin voters on a very important issue, there remains considerable support for his anti-collective bargaining position in Wisconsin. Still, polls reveal that a majority of Wisconsinites disapprove of Walker's anti-collective bargaining stance, calling into question whether or not the Governor would have emerged victorious in his race had he been more forthright with the voters of his state.

Certainly, Governor Walker is not the first politician to fudge the truth during an election. There are ample examples on both sides of the political divide where dishonest campaigning is the norm.

But will Wisconsin voters punish their governor for putting his state through the political turmoil that might have been avoided had he warned them of his plans? According to the most recent PPP survey, while Walker's approval numbers in his state are upside down — 52 percent voice disapproval with their controversial governor— he fares better on the question of returning him to office. His fate, however, remains a toss up with 49 percent of Wisconsinites saying he should stay and 49 percent saying he should go.

Clearly, this is going to be a very interesting election and I cannot imagine a better opportunity for voters to voice the opinion that we would prefer our candidates to be honest about their plans before we elect them to office rather than surprise us after they've got the job.

In a major achievement, the Giant Metre-wave Radio Telescope (GMRT) at Khodad detected and tracked the landing of a European Space Agency spacecraft on a Mars mission, an official said here on Thursday.

""On Wednesday evening from 7.04 p.m., the GMRT clearly detected and tracked the weak signal emanating from Schiaparelli EDM, all the way into the last phases of the descent of module through the Martian atmosphere till 8.37 p.m.,"" said GMRT Dean Yashwant Gupta.

Watch What Else Is Making News

Schiaparelli's entry and descent module (EDM) of the ExoMarch Project separated from the parent spacecraft, the Trace Gas Orbiter (TGO) on October 16 after a six-month-long journey from Earth. It followed a trajectory that brought it to the point of entering the Martian atmosphere for a landing on Wednesday (October 19) evening, Gupta said.

""The six-minute journey through the (Martian) atmosphere is the most hazardous part of the project and many previous Mars lander missions have failed at this critical juncture,"" Gupta said.

A radio frequency transmitter transmits waves which are the only means to ascertain the health of the lander. It must be ensured that the lander, travelling at very high speeds, doesn't get overheated and lands without damage. During this period, the GMRT observed, detected and transmitted the waves received from the lander live to the ExoMars Mission Control centre in Germany.

In order to monitor the health of the EDM during this crucial phase, the US's NASA had assigned GMRT, to act as a receiver station for this mission on behalf of the ExoMars Project, he added. Terming it as ""a historic achievement"", Gupta said that with this, GMRT has extended its scope to the arena of planetary space missions.

Elaborating on the challenge GMRT faced, Gupta said the signal at a frequency of 401 MHz is very weak, emitted by a 5W transmitter on the EDM and it required the high sensitivity and interference-free environment of the GMRT to detect it.

""The receivers covering this frequency have been developed by National Centre of Radio Astrophysics of Tata Institute of Fundamental Research, as part of GMRT's upgrade, well in time for this (Mars) mission,"" Gupta said.

The detection was made possible by signals from the GMRT antennae and analysing them with special signal processing software that was jointly developed by GMRT and NASA. The display from GMRT was streamed live to the ExoMars Mission Control centre in Germany, which provided valuable real-time monitoring facility to the project team there.

In fact, the Pune-based observatory's system was tested in August-September with test signals generated by the NASA's Mars Rover, which is currently exploring the Martian surface and GMRT had successfully detected them, he said. The GMRT, built and operated by TIFR's NCRA since 15 years, is one of the world's largest and most sensitive radio telescopes operating at metre and centimeter radio wavelengths, situated at Khodad, around 70 km from Pune.

259087,False,1024,"It is no secret that major changes were made to the background, plot, and dialogueue of Phantasy Star while it was being translated from Japanese to English. It is also known that some changes, such as having the main character of Phantasy Star IV be named ""Chaz"" and not ""Rudy,"" were done on purpose and were completely unnecessary. Why this was done we may never know, but the result is that the two versions of Phantasy Star are as different as they are alike.

The following is our attempt to document every known difference between the Japanese and English Phantasy Star titles. Some, like the above-mentioned name changes, are minor and make no real alteration to the games' plots. Some, like the origin of Algo, are incredibly major and are the changes most responsible for the two separate continuities we call The Two Phantasy Stars.

(Note: PSOPC stands for The Phantasy Star Official Production Compendium, a book published in Japan by Soft Bank and translated into English by Rebecca Capowski. All quotes attributed to the PSOPC come from Rebecca's translation.)

Phantasy Star I

Date: Japanese PSI takes place in AW 342. English PSI takes place in Space Century 342.

This change seems minor at first, but when PSII's date is taken into consideration, the change becomes more profound. Japanese PSII's date is AW 1284, which means 942 years have passed since Japanese PSI. However, according to English PSII's opening narration, ""over 1000 years have passed"" since English PSI. While the change from ""AW 342"" to ""Space Century 342"" was obviously deliberate, we doubt that the change from a 942 year gap to a 1000 year gap was, as well. However, though unintentional, this is still a major difference which alone places the Japanese and English Phantasy Star series on different continuity timelines.

On a related note, regarding the AW calendar, in Japanese Phantasy Star, AW stands for ""After Waizz,"" referring to Waizz Landeel, Alis's ancestor and the first to establish a fiefdom on Palma, some 342 years before Japanese PSI. However, the fact that Waizz Landeel is never mentioned in any English Phantasy Star game, along with the fact that the AW calendar does not debut in English Phantasy Star until PSII, raises the possibility that the origin of the AW calendar may be yet another difference between the two Phantasy Stars.


Lassic's Corruption: The PSOPC refers to the following events as having taken place a year before Japanese PSI: ""La Shiec learns the secret of the Algol Solar System's genesis. Forming a space-time gate, he comes into contact with the sealed-away spirit-life form. As a result, he summons the projected body of the Profound Darkness, Dark Force, and becomes its loyal servant. That same year, a reign of terror begins.""

This is much, much different than the explanation given for English PSI in English PSI's instruction booklet: ""It started with a new religion which was rumored to have come from another galaxy. The dark priests of this religion, never seen by any mortal, promised immortality to all who joined. ... The idea of living forever appealed to him [Lassic] so he became the first to join. Then, he... changed. It started with the threatening suit of armor the priests made for him. The armor looked evil and corrupt, and that's how Lassic began to rule his people.""

In other words, in Japanese PSI, the force that corrupts Lassic is something that he seeks out; in English PSI, the corrupting force seeks him out. This change is major because this implies that in English PSI there are other forces at work behind-the-scenes in Algo with a plan to corrupt Lassic, while no such implication exists in Japanese PSI.


Alis's fate: In Japan only, Sega released two Phantasy Star titles for the Game Gear, Phantasy Star Adventure and Phantasy Star Gaiden. It is noteable to mention that Phantasy Star Gaiden even featured the return of Alis Landale, and the introduction of her daughter! However, as these games were never released in America, they are not necessarily a part of the English canon (and their canonity in the Japanese Phantasy Star universe is also questionable).


Character Names: In order to accomodate English PSI's four character name arrays, certain Japanese names like Alicer and Tylon had to be changed to short, four-letters-or-less names like Alis and Odin. However, in Japanese PSI, the character known in the English version as Noah was named Lutz. Obviously, ""Lutz"" would have fit into a four character array, so this change must be considered deliberate.

256242,True,786,"A new meal program — which will be implemented at the start of the next school year — will require students living in dorms to deposit a minimum of $1,400 onto their WisCard for dining purposes.

Students in UW-Madison's dorms will see a new charge on their housing bill next year. The university will require residents to deposit a minimum of $1,400 on their WisCard, to be used exclusively in dining halls.

According to Dining and Culinary officials, residents will pick a set amount of money — between $1,400 and $3,100 — to deposit on their card. The money can only be used in dining halls or unions and will be forfeited if not used up by the end of the academic year.

The change to a ""tiered"" resident meal plan is an attempt to be ""upfront"" and ""transparent"" with parents concerned their student was spending more than anticipated in dining halls, according to Director of Dining and Culinary Services Peter Testory.

""[This system] is really giving people a better picture as to how many meals a week do you think you are going to eat in the residence hall,"" Testory said. ""[It gives you an idea of] the amount of money that you should look at spending for the entire academic year.""

While in the past the university simply informed residents about how much an average student spends throughout the year, Testory said a required tier system will allow the university to understand its budget, and therefore keep food prices low for students.

Testory said the minimum spend tiers were determined based on the historical average spending rates on campus. He said that, while the average amount of money a student spends in the dining hall each year is around $1,200, students also spend an average of $200 in the Unions — which is how they settled on the $1,400 minimum.

The minimum tier — ""Bronze"" — equates to approximately nine meals a week. Those who choose the ""Silver"" and ""Gold"" tiers must deposit more money but will receive incentives, like bonus dining cash and free beverages.

A student enters the silver tier by putting between $2,100 and $3,099 on their card, and the gold tier by depositing a minimum amount of $3,100.

The money will be deposited into a specific Resident Food Account on the students' WisCards . Students who wish to purchase non-food products with their WisCard at locations like the University Bookstore must transfer supplementary money onto their card.

Despite the new required minimum deposits that incentivize students to spend more money at the dining hall, all food purchases in the dining halls will remain à la carte — students will continue to pay only for what they eat.

Testory acknowledged that some students may not be able to afford the required dining fee. He said that although there is currently ""no solidified plan"" to deal with that, the department will have a solution before the new plan begins next year.

""Food insecurity on campus is a big issue, and it is a big issue for us as a department,"" he said. ""We are working on a process to address students who fall within that category.""

Students living off-campus will still be able to get a five percent discount on dining hall-prepared food under the new system, but will not be required to deposit a minimum amount of money.

Testory said that while dining service officials are discussing a way to offer off-campus students a type of meal program, their focus right now is on the resident meal program.

""We didn't really change our current model,"" Testory said. ""We took the information we had and tried to lay it out a little clearer with this plan.""",0.8065409726644057,0.8065409726644057,0.0,0.0

Welcome back and thanks for watching ""Days of Future Past,"" written by Melinda Hsu Taylor and directed by our very own Ian Somerhalder. I've asked Ian to take the reins of the blog tonight as a special guest columnist, but before I hand them over, I did want to mention that I recently became aware of a conversation taking place in the television fan community about a story trope the writers and I were unfamiliar with, but one that has clearly touched a nerve. Part of this particular trope involves the statistically high death count of lesbian characters in television. As you can imagine (SPOILER ALERT), I was immediately concerned that our next episode featured the deaths of Nora and Mary Louise, the betrothed Heretics. Unfortunately on The Vampire Diaries, death is the probable outcome for nearly every character who passes through our universe. However, we realize we may have unintentionally offended as we sent this couple to meet their tragic fate. The conversation around this issue encourages me and hopefully the entire television landscape to do better on a larger scale as we all set out to tell stories that honor and are inclusive of the LGBTQ community. Thanks to the fan community for starting a dialogue and raising awareness, and reminding us that we as writers have a voice that allows us the freedom to help make this world a better place.

I'm truly grateful to have had this opportunity to talk with you all after tonight's episode and will get right to it.

The last time I got to direct an episode the story was much darker, more dangerous, pushing our characters (Caroline and Stefan) to the brink of pure evil. This time was a bit different. This story required a much more layered approach because it was setting up our current timeline, three years in the future. No more bookending the episodes with the flash forwards; we will stay right here. For now at least…

""Days of Future Past"" had more story lines built into it, all of them laden with heavy consequences, all building simultaneously into an emotional crescendo and then abruptly ending in tragedy with our hero in the Hell Stone and no way to get him out.

I was actually very lucky, because I directed 616 last year and 716 this year, which fell within the window of the Christmas hiatus. I feel super fortunate to have had that stroke of scheduling luck because I got much more time with the script while I was on vacation with my family. It was great being there in the mountains with the peace and quiet of white snow that really allowed my mind to dream of shots, performance, and style.

Directing anything from a short film to an episode of television or a big-budget studio film is quite a journey with so many moving parts. Every moment, you are racing against the clock, living with two major issues breathing down your neck at ALL times. Yep, much like in life, those two major things are time and money. How quickly and successfully can you capture the story on the page, in your head, and on the story board in the time allowed, using a very set amount of money to do it? Kind of like life, right?

Again much like life and that famous movie quote we all know, directing a serialized show is like a box of chocolates: You never know what you're going to get. You know the story only when the writers push send and the script shows up in your inbox… It's pretty wild because you have no way of knowing in advance what the story will be, what to expect, and the anticipation makes it a game of patience. Then once you get it (hopefully on time), you have to study it intimately. Without a total understanding of the story and the journeys of the characters, it's nearly impossible to try and tell it with cameras or actors. You need to know every scene, every beat, all the nuances, and how they all contribute to story as a whole. I once read an article that Anthony Hopkins",0.7508355607813526,0.7508355607813526,0.0,0.0
